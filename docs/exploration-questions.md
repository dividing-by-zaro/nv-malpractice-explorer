- Seasonal patterns (more cases filed in certain months?)
- Geographic hotspots (Las Vegas vs Reno vs rural)

### Notable Cases
Use an LLM to evaluate and surface cases that are genuinely unusual or notable - not just run-of-the-mill malpractice. Flag cases that involve:

- Bizarre or unusual circumstances
- Egregious negligence or recklessness
- Unusual patterns of behavior
- Cases that made news or had broader impact
- Particularly tragic or preventable outcomes
- Doctor impairment (substances, mental health)
- Sexual misconduct or boundary violations
- Fraud, falsified records, or cover-ups
- Multiple victims from single incident
- Systemic failures beyond individual error

The goal is to surface the ~5-10% of cases that tell a compelling or cautionary story, distinct from routine documentation errors or standard-of-care disputes.
