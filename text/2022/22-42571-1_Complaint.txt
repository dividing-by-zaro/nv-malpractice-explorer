COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

5. On July 20, 2015 Patient A underwent a CT of his head without contrast and that

report was read by another provider with findings of “no acute intracranial process.”

6. On or about July 20, 2015, Patient A underwent an MRI of the brain without
contrast.
7. Respondent interpreted the report with a finding of “no acute infarct” and “chronic

occlusion of the internal carotid artery.”

8. On or about July 21, 2015, Patient A suffered a serious stroke.

9. Respondent, by failing to interpret the MRI correctly and in a timely manner, put
Patient A in a situation where it was too late for treatment such as tpa IV initially and subsequent
endovascular therapy to have any effect.

10. Due to the delay in interpreting the MRI, which subsequently led to a lack of tpa IV
administration and endovascular therapy, Patient A eventually suffered from acute infarct in the
left posterior basal ganglia internal capsule.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

11. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

12. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

13. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

14. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IT
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation

16. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

17. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

18. | NAC 630.210 requires a physician to seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.

19. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition from on or about July 20, 2015. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate
care provider to address the doubtfulness of, or difficulty in, the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical
condition. A timely consultation may have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and may have
enhanced the quality of medical care provided to Patient A with regard to suffering too long from
an eschemic stroke without any treatment..

20. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1, That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4, That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,

conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
