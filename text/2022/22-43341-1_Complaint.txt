COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Ian J. Cumings, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Kim Marie Hiatt, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 16939). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on February 10, 2017.

2. On October 20, 2020, the Wyoming Board of Medicine entered a Stipulation for
reactivation subject to a reprimand and fine against Respondent. See Exhibit 1. The underlying
basis for discipline was the Respondent’s failure to timely renew her license which expired on
June 30, 2019; whereupon she continued to practice medicine in Wyoming from
July 1, 2019 through December 19, 2019, without an active license and treated approximately five
hundred (500) patients.


! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Aury Nagy, M.D., and
Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.).
