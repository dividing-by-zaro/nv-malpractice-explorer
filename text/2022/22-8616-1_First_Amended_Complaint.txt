FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Donald K. White, J.D., Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the
IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Morton Isaac Hyson, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 6062). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 1, 1990.

2. On November 27, 2020, Respondent entered into a Settlement Agreement with the
IC and was approved by the Board on December 4, 2020.

3. Notably, a restriction/condition contained in the Settlement Agreement was a
requirement that Respondent shall have a female chaperone employed and present during all
female patient encounters and document such a chaperone within the medical records.

4. On June 4, 2021, Respondent appeared before the Board, during a regularly held

Board meeting, along with his attorney and requested that the Board remove all conditions and

restrictions on his medical license, thereby reinstating an unrestricted license. During his
appearance, Respondent adamantly assured the Board that if the Condition was lifted, he would
continue to comply with the conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement of
December 4, 2020, in order to address the Board’s original concerns and honor the intent of the
Settlement Agreement. Specifically, Respondent represented that he would continue to keep a
female chaperone employed and present during all female patient encounters and that he would
document the presence of the chaperone within the medical records. It was further represented
that if the Condition was removed, the matter would be remanded back to the Investigative
Committee, which would have the ability to determine whether Respondent would indeed comply
with the representations made during the appearance.

5. Relying on Respondent’s representations, on June 16, 2021, the Board filed an
Order removing the restriction/condition from Respondent’s license to practice medicine in the
State of Nevada and remanded the matter back to the Board’s Investigative Committee, based on
the agreement that he would continue to utilize chaperones.

6. Upon information and belief, on or about February 7, 2022, Patient A? visited
Respondent for consultation about a neurological test. This was a normal visit and nothing seemed
out of the ordinary to Patient A.

7. Upon information and belief, Patient A returned to Respondent’s office for
performance of the neurological test on or about February 9, 2022.

8. Upon information and belief, Respondent began the second portion of Patient A’s
test by puncturing her arm approximately five (5) times with a needle without properly sterilizing
her skin.

9. Upon information and belief, Patient A was uncomfortable when Respondent was
performing this part of the test on February 9, 2022, which included unnecessary touching of her
arms and foot without a female chaperone present in the room.

10. Upon information and belief, on February 9, 2022, Respondent spoke to Patient A

and acted in a manner which made her feel uncomfortable.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but was disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of the Order for Summary Suspension.

conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement of December 4, 2020 in order to address the

Board’s original concerns and the honor intent of the Settlement Agreement. Specifically,
Respondent represented that he would continue to keep a female chaperone employed and present
during all female patient encounters and that he would document the presence of the chaperone
within the medical records. Respondent even commented to the Board that he would do this
regardless as “it makes sense in this day and age to do so.” He led the Board to believe he was
intending to fully comply with this requirement whether the condition remained on his license or
not.
