The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

having a reasonable basis to believe that Veronica Arrey Akem, RRT (Respondent) violated the

(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating
the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

practice respiratory care by the Board on January 2, 2020, pursuant to NAC 630.535 which
provides, in summary, if a licensee loses certification by the NBRC or its successor organization,

his or her license to practice respiratory care is automatically suspended until further order of the

Board.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ahsan,
