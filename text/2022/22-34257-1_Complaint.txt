BEFORE THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS

OF THE STATE OF NEVADA
In the Matter of Charges and Case No. 22-34257-1

Complaint Against:
NAYAB MOHAMMAD ZABFAR, M.D.,

Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Donald K. White, J.D., Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the
IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Nayab Mohammad Zafar, M.D., (Respondent) violated
the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the
IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1, Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 12883). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on September 8, 2008.

2. Patient A? was a sixty-eight (68) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On May 21, 2013, Respondent examined Patient A and noted that she had a recent
computed tomography (CT) angiography, showing 70% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.

4. Respondent also noted that Patient A presented a high surgical risk due to several
factors. Respondent recommended that Patient A be scheduled for a carotid angiography and

possible intervention, depending on the results of the carotid angiogram.

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Mr. M. Neil

Duxbury, Aury Nagy, M.D.
2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient

Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. Patient A presented to Respondent on June 11, 2013, for a carotid aortogram and
arch aortogram. Respondent noted that Patient A had 80% stenosis of the left common carotid
artery and it was calcified.

6. On June 18, 2013, at a follow up visit, Respondent recommended, due to various
factors, a balloon angioplasty and stent placement with an embolic protection device. Respondent
noted that Patient A was not a good candidate for endarterectomy.

7. On July 1, 2013, Respondent performed the carotid stent procedure on Patient A.
To reduce the risk of embolism during the procedure, Respondent employed the use of a filter
wire.

8. Indications show that Respondent’s diagnosis, risk assessment, procedural
indication, procedural decision making, and technique with regards to treating Patient A all
appeared to be appropriate.

9. However, Respondent chose to use a hydrophilic glide wire as the “buddy” wire.
Hydrophilic wires, because of the wire’s coating, are more likely to become stuck if placed
between two hard surfaces, e.g., the metal of a stent and a heavily calcified lesion. This is a
particular problem if the hydrophilic wire is not removed before stent deployment.

10. Unfortunately, the stent had been deployed, trapping the hydrophilic wire (buddy
wire) between the calcified lesion and the stent.

11. | Respondent had considered and decided to also use a filter wire to protect against
the likelihood of embolism, due to the stent’s ability to break off pieces of the calcification during
the process.

12. Due to the hydrophilic wire (buddy wire) being trapped, however, the hydrophilic
wire became the working wire and the filter wire became the buddy wire.

13. There was then no safe possible way to extract the filter wire unless the filter was
collapsed and removed, thereby removing the protection against cerebral embolism, which would
increase the the risk of intra-procedural stroke.

14. Due to the entrapment of the filter wire, emergency surgical retrieval of the

endovascular wire and stent was required, and performed.

15. Respondent maintained in his response to the Board that he had instructed the scrub
technician to only partially inflate the stent. There is, however, no indication in Respondent’s
medical records that he, in fact, mentioned this to the scrub technician.

COUNT I

16. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

disciplinary action against a licensee.

18. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

19. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A when he made an error in judgment that resulted in the
endovascular wire being trapped, thereby requiring emergency surgery.

20. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT It
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Proper Medical Records

grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

23. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document that he instructed the scrub

technician to only partially inflate the stent if he, in fact, gave this instruction.
