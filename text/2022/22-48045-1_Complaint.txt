Voluntary Submittal to Jurisdiction (herein, “Order” or “Agreement”) for acceptance by the Board.
Okla. Admin. Code § 435:5-1-5.1.

By voluntarily submitting to jurisdiction and entering into this Order, Defendant admits
to the allegations herein contained and further acknowledges that a hearing before the Board
could result in some sanction under the Oklahoma Allopathic Medical and Surgical Licensure
and Supervision Act (“Act”). 59 O.S. § 480, ef seq.

Defendant, Eric Joseph Pippi, P.A., states that he is of sound mind and is not under the
influence of, or impaired by, any medication or drug and that he fully recognizes his right to
appear before the Board for an evidentiary hearing on the allegations made against him.
Defendant hereby voluntarily waives his right to a full hearing, submits to the jurisdiction of the
Board and agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this Order. Defendant acknowledges
that he has read and understands the terms and conditions stated herein, and that this Agreement
may be reviewed and discussed with him by legal counsel prior to execution.

If the Board does not accept this Order, the Parties stipulate that it shall be regarded as
null and void. Admissions by Defendant herein, if any, shall not be regarded as evidence against
him in a subsequent disciplinary hearing. Defendant will be free to defend himself and no
inferences will be made from his willingness to have this Order accepted by the Board. The
Parties stipulate that neither the presentation of this Order no the Board’s consideration of this

Eric Joseph Pippi, P.A. 2468
Order shall be deemed to have unfairly or illegally prejudiced the Board or its individual
members and, therefore, shall not be grounds for precluding the Board nor any individual Board
member from further participation in proceedings related to the matters set forth herein.

Findings of Fact

1, Defendant was required to complete twenty (20) hours of continuing education by
December 31, 2018. Defendant failed to complete the required twenty (20) hours and,
therefore, was then required to complete a total of forty (40) hours of continuing education
no later than December 31, 2019.

2. Defendant failed to complete the forty (40) hours by December 31, 2019.

Conclusions of Law

3. The Board is authorized to suspend, revoke or order any other appropriate sanctions against
the license of any Physician Assistant holding a license to practice in the State of Oklahoma
for unprofessional conduct. 59 O.S. 519.1 et seq. Okla. Admin. Code § 435:15-5-11 and
59 O.S. § 503 and 509.1(F). This authority is quasi-judicial 59 O.S. § 513(A)(1).

4, Based on the foregoing, Defendant is guilty of unprofessional conduct as follows:

a. Licenses issued to the physician assistants shall be renewed annually on a date
determined by the State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision. Each
application for renewal shall document that the physician assistant has earned al
least twenty (20) hours of continuing medical education during the preceding
calendar year in violation of Title 59 § 519.8 (A); and

Failure to meet those additional requirements will result in further disciplinary
action, in violation of Okla, Admin. Code § 435:15-3-17(d).
