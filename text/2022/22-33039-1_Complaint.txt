administering this dangerous drug. Respondent further failed to document Patient A’s vital signs
and failed to counsel Patient A on the risks of the controlled substance.

4, On January 7, 2019, Patient A presented to Respondent with complaints of lumbar
pain radiating to the buttocks, Respondent prescribed Patient A Tramadol (a controlled substance
and considered a dangerous drug) 50 mg 90 count for thirty (30) days. There was no medical
justification or rationale documented in Patient A’s medical record for the prescription.
Respondent further failed to document Patient A’s complaints within the medical record and failed
to document any vital signs. Respondent, again, failed to counsel Patient A on the risks of the
controlled substance and included an invalid copy of a blank pain management contract in Patient
A’s medical chart without a Patient A’s signature, a date, and or witness attestation.

5. On February 20, 2019, Patient A presented to Respondent with complaints of
lumbar pain radiating to the buttocks. Respondent again failed to document Patient A’s
complaints within the medical record and failed to document any vital signs. Respondent
discharged and prescribed additional opiates and sedatives, Tramadol, 50 mg 90 count for thirty
(30) days, and Clonazepam 0.5 mg 90 count for thirty (30) days, without any medical justification
or rationale noted in the medical record. Respondent further failed to counsel Patient A, for a
third time, on the risks of the controlled substances.

6. On May 22, 2019, Patient A presented to Respondent for back pain; however,
Respondent did not document any complaints of pain within the review of symptoms section of
the medical record. Patient A’s vital signs were also not documented. Respondent discharged and
prescribed opiates and sedatives, Tramadol and Alprazolam, without any medical justification or
rationale for these prescriptions in the record. Patient A’s history of present illness (HPI) notes
were duplicative and highly templated from the January 7, 2019, and February 20, 2019, visits.
Respondent again failed to counsel Patient A on the risks of the controlled substances.

te On July 2, 2019, Respondent noted in Patient A’s medical record with the
following complaints: schizophrenia, anxiety disorder, abdominal pain, dizziness for which patient
takes meclizine, and patient has continuous falls and can only ambulate with crutches. Patient A’s

vital signs were again, not documented. In the patient history section of the medical record,

(775) 688-2559


Respondent documented Patient A has recurrent abdominal pain and requested a referral to a
gastroenterologist. Additionally, Respondent documented that Patient A reported anxiety, but also
documented Patient A had no depression, no insomnia, no stress, and no loss of interest.
Respondent diagnosed Patient A with abdominal pain, epigastric pain, an ingrown toenail,
dizziness and giddiness, screening from malignant neoplasm, and unspecified falls. Respondent
prescribed opiates and sedative without medical justification or rationale. Again, Respondent did
not counsel Patient A on the risk of the controlled substances.

8. From January 2019 through July 2019, Patient A was clinically evaluated by the
Respondent, during which time he continuously prescribed Tramadol for lumbago with sciatica
and Clonazepam for Patient A’s anxiety. Respondent repeatedly failed to document in Patient A’s
medical record an adequate HPI, vitals, or a focused physical examination regarding Patient A’s
diagnoses. Further, Respondent repeatedly failed to document in Patient A’s medical record the
history of his conditions, response to those treatments or justifications for prescribing the
controlled substances, nor was Patient A counseled on the risks of those controlled substances.

9. From June 26, 2018, through April 28, 2020, the Nevada Prescription Monitoring
Program (PMP) report indicates that Respondent continuously prescribed controlled substances,
including Tramadol and Clonazepam. Respondent did not execute with Patient A the required
Medication Use Agreement. Patient A did not undergo a risk assessment or urine drug testing.
