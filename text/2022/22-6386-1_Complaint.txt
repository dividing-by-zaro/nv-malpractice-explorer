The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

treatments with Kybella to decrease inner thigh fat. Mesotherapy consists of numerous injections
into the mesoderm aimed at diminishing excess fat.

4, Respondent’s treatment plan was to use compounded deoxycholic acid at 4.75%
with lidocaine which is not FDA approved as opposed to Kybella, which is solely composed of
deoxycholic acid and is FDA approved for the treatment of submental fat of the upper neck only.

5. Listed side effects for Kybella include injection site problems such as hair loss,
bruising, open sores, tissue damage, necrosis, and cell death around the injection site.

6. On January 5, 2017, Patient A signed a consent form for mesotherapy utilizing
deoxycholic acid with lidocaine. No location on Patient A’s body for the treatment was noted on
the consent form.

7. The consent form provided: “[p]atients may experience redness, itching, and/or
blistering, which is short lived and treated with mild topical cortisones. It does not leave any
scarring or have any permanent effects.”

8. Patient A was not given informed consent that compounded deoxycholic acid with
lidocaine is not FDA approved, and injection of Kybella or compounded deoxycholic acid with
lidocaine for any site other than submental fat of the neck is an off-label use.

9. Patient A was not given informed consent of any rare side effects associated with
deoxycholic acid which include tissue damage, necrosis, and cell death around the injection site.

10. On January 5, 2017, Respondent administered a mesotherapy treatment consisting
of 4.75% deoxycholate and lidocaine to Patient A’s inner thigh area. Immediately following
Respondent’s treatment, Patient A experienced severe bruising and blisters at the injection site.

11. On January 11, 2017, at a follow-up appointment, Patient A presented with signs of
infection, tenderness, redness, and inflammation. Respondent ordered antibiotics to treat the
infections at injection sites.

12. By January 18, 2017, Patient A failed to improve with antibiotics, Patient A
presented to Respondent, who noted Patient A’s condition was worsening with tenderness and
redness around the injection sites. Respondent prescribed steroids, and a second round of

antibiotics and but did not refer Patient A for more specialized wound care.

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


13. Following the January 18, 2017, visit, Patient A did not return to Respondent for
any follow-up appointments or care. Neither the Respondent or clinical staff made any attempt to
contact Patient A or refer her to another physician after the January 18, 2017, to inquire about the
Patient’s rare and serious complications as a result of the Mesotherapy.

14. On January 23, 2017, Patient A sought a second opinion and received medical care
from a Board-Certified Plastic Surgeon. It was determined that the wounds on Patient A’s thighs
were necrotic which required surgical debridement under general anesthesia.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

15. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

16. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a Physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

17. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

18. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A by failing to provide informed consent for deoxycholic
acid injections into a non-FDA approved injection site, and for failing to follow up with Patient A
after January 18, 2017, despite the rare and serious complication after the mesotherapy treatment
and resultant infection.

19. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT I
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Proper Medical Records
20. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

reference as though fully set forth herein.

21. | NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

22. Respondent failed to maintain proper medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment, and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions when he treated
Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete. Respondent
failed to document informed consent for Patient A’s mesotherapy and the associated risks of
Kybella, and compounded deoxycholic acid injections.

23. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT Il
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation

24. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

25. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

26. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

27. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition after January 18, 2018, and Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care
provider to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition and such a
timely consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and may have enhanced the

quality of medical care provided to the Patient with regard to the infection and resultant necrosis.

28. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

therapy which by the current standards of practice of medicine is experimental requires specific
informed consent. These consents regularly include the goals, benefits, risks, and alternative
therapies for the treatment being offered.

31. Respondent’s records did not contain specific informed consent advising Patient A
that compounded deoxycholic acid with lidocaine was not FDA approved nor advised Patient A of
risks including the possibility of skin breakdown, scarring or necrotic tissue forming.
Additionally, Respondent failed to obtain informed consent by failing to discuss the serious side
effects for the mesotherapy treatments that were used off-label.
