Designation served upon Respondent, along with a copy of this Complaint, and filed under seal.

3. Patient A visited Respondent, a family practice physician, for treatment on or about
October 1, 2013, until approximately January 6, 2014.


1 The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal

practitioner for the medical treatment and plan of care for Patient A.

13. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

14. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment, and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions when he treated
Patient A.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

PATIENT B

16. All the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

of a physical exam, any indication that weight or growth was followed, nor an adequate patient
history. Respondent diagnosed Patient B with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),
Mood Disorder, and Autism, but there is no analysis, criteria or testing for how these diagnoses
were reached by Respondent.

20. Respondent prescribed Abilify and Risperidone to Patient B, while he was already

COUNT Hit
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation

21. All the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

22. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

23. | NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

24. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation of a mental health provider regarding
Patient B’s medical conditions from March 27, 2014, through August 24, 2016. Respondent
should have consulted with an appropriate mental health care provider to address the doubtfulness
and difficulty of Patient B’s diagnoses and medical conditions, which may have enhanced the
quality of medical care provided to Patient B.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

NRS 630.306(1)(e) - Practice Beyond Scope of License

26. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

scope permitted by law or performing services which the licensee knows or has reason to know
that he or she is not competent to perform, or which are beyond the scope of his or her training
constitutes grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

28. Patient B required a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation, which was beyond the
scope of Respondent’s training as a family practice physician. Instead, Patient B should have been
referred to a mental health practitioner for this evaluation.

prescribed for children with bipolar disorder. However, in this case there is no documented

analysis for the prescribed medicine, nor is there any documentation to reflect that a parent of

was no documentation that cardiac risk factors, benefits, contra-indications, nor medication side
effects were ever discussed with the parents of Patient D.
