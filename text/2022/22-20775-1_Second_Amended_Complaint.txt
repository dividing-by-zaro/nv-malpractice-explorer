The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(Board), by and through Donald K. White, J.D., Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for

license listing of Aesthetics Medical Training LLC (Aesthetics Med Spa) (AMS), was a Nevada
limited liability company with its principal place of business located at 6295 Sharlands Avenue,
Suite 1, Reno, Nevada 89523.


! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of the

4, Jasmine Wells (Wells) was AMS’s noncommercial Registered Agent, and sole
Officer and Managing Member.

5. AMS, through its managing member Wells, advertised itself as a “medical spa”
“specializing” in medical procedures, products and treatments including in-part, laser hair
removal, Botox, dermal filler injections, Latisse, medical skin peels, as well as non-medical

aesthetic and cosmetological services.

6. Respondent was an independent contractor of AMS.
7. Respondent was not a manager, agent, officer or employee of AMS.
8. Respondent had no ownership or member interest in AMS, nor did he have

contractual authority to manage the affairs of AMS.

9, Neither Wells, nor any of AMS’s employees or other independent contractors were
employed by Respondent during the time Respondent served as Medical Director of AMS.

10. At all times relevant to the facts alleged herein, neither Wells, nor any other
member, manager, employee or independent contractor of AMS, was licensed by any Nevada
professional licensing board in the State of Nevada pursuant to chapters 630 to 637, inclusive, 639
or 640 of the NRS. In fact, only one (1) registered nurse was listed as an employee of the
business.

11. No person in any way affiliated with or employed by AMS held a Nevada medical
license issued by the Board during the time Respondent served under the title Medical Director,
other than Respondent himself.

12. Wells was at all relevant times a Nevada licensed “Esthetician” (License # A-3199)
and listed under the name of “Jasbinder Wells.”

13. Patient A was a fifty-six (56) year old female patient during the events in question.
Her identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent, along with a copy of the Complaint, and filed under seal.

14. Patient A first visited AMS on April 21, 2016, for a consultation that led to her
receiving laser treatments to her face, neck and chest areas.

15. Patient A once again visited AMS to receive treatment on both of her forearms on
April 26, 2016.

16. | Ms. Wells, who is a medical assistant, performed the IPL laser treatment on Patient
A’s forearms when Respondent was not present.

17. | NRS 630.020 defines the “Practice of Medicine,” and provides in-part that it means
to (1) diagnose, treat, correct, prevent or prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury,
infirmity, deformity or other condition, physical or mental, by any means or instrumentality,
including, but not limited to, the performance of an autopsy.

18. By statute, Ms. Wells was participating in the practice of medicine.

19. There is no indication that Respondent was personally present at AMS during
Patient A’s treatments on April 21, 2016, and April 26, 2016, and therefore, failed to properly
supervise Ms. Wells when she diagnosed and treated Patient A.

20. Due to the absence of Respondent at AMS on April 21, 2016, and April 26, 2016,
no diagnoses or treatments could have been directly supervised or performed by Respondent on
Patient A.

COUNT I
NRS 630.306(1)(r) — Failure to Adequately Supervise Medical Assistants

21. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set
forth herein.

22. NRS 630.306(1)(r) provides that a failure to adequately supervise a medical
assistant pursuant to the regulations of the Board is an act that constitutes grounds for initiating
disciplinary action.

23. By the conduct described herein, Respondent failed to adequately supervise, or
supervise in any way, Wells in her performance of medical tasks on April 21, 2016, and
April 26, 2016, despite being the Medical Director.


2 NRS 630.0129 defines a “medical assistant” as: 1) a person who (a) performs clinical tasks under the
supervision of a physician or physician assistant, and (b) does not hold a license, certificate or registration issued by a
professional licensing or regulatory board in this State to perform such clinical tasks; and 2) the term does not include
a person who performs only administrative, clerical, executive or other nonclinical tasks.
