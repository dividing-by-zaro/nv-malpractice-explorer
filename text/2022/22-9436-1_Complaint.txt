October 13, 2021, replying to the investigator’s letter dated September 20, 2021. Again,
Respondent reiterated that he would not be available to answer any questions by the IC at
1:30 p.m., but would be available at 12:00 p.m., (noon) or 3:30 p.m., on November 10, 2021.

9, On November 10, 2021, Respondent failed to appear telephonically at 1:30 p.m.,
