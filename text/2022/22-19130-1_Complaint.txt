COMPLAINT =

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Ian J. Cumings, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Amy Renee Sparks, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating
the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 9522). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 26, 2000.

2. Patient A was a 66-year-old female at the time of the events at issue. Patient A’s
true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

I. Patient A’s Medical History Prior to Respondent’s Treatment

3. In January 2015, Patient A was seen by a cardiologist for pre-syncope. Multiple

tests revealed no blood flow issues and a normal resting electrocardiogram. An echocardiogram


! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. Neil M. Duxbury, Aury Nagy, M.D., and
Michael C. Edwards, M.D.

showed an ejection fraction of 50-55%. A halter monitor was placed, which detected ventricular
tachycardia on February 24, 2015.

4. Patient A was admitted to the hospital on February 24, 2015. During Patient A’s
hospital stay her B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a hormone excreted by the heart which can
indicate cardiac injury or heart failure, was elevated at 176 which indicated further evaluation was
necessary.

5. Further halter monitoring in May 2015 showed Patient A demonstrated non-
sustained ventricular tachycardia.

II. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient A

6. On February 24, 2016, Patient A presented to the Respondent to establish care. In
Respondent’s records, a history of ventricular tachycardia was noted. Respondent ordered labs,
including thyroid testing, urinalysis for heavy metals, and a Boston Heart Panel which is used for
cardiovascular disease characterization.

7. Patient A’s lab results showed her N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-
proBNP), a non-active prohormone excreted by the heart which is used to test for or diagnose
heart failure, was 1248, well above the normal range. Patient A’s initial lead level was normal.

8. Patient A was subsequently sent a letter informing her there was an inflammatory
process increasing her cardiovascular risk and recommended vitamins and supplements.
Respondent failed to recommend or refer Patient A for a cardiac workup. The standard of care
dictates further evaluation with an echocardiogram or electrocardiogram is necessary for a patient
with a highly elevated NT-proBNP as this can indicate heart failure or cardiac disease.

9. Patient A saw Respondent on no less than four (4) occasions from April 15, 2016,
through February 13, 2018, during which time, the Respondent ordered repeated lab testing
showing Patient A had sustained highly elevated NT-proBNP levels. Respondent failed to either
appropriately discuss or document the significance of Patient A’s NT-proBNP level with the
Patient during any of these visits. Furthermore, Respondent repeatedly failed to refer Patient A to
a cardiologist during this period of time, despite continual elevated NT-proBNP results and a

history of recent ventricular tachycardia.

10... During the Respondent’s care of Patient A from April 15, 2016 through
February 13, 2018, Respondent repeatedly ordered provoked urine testing with DMSA to evaluate
Patient A’s lead level, despite a normal urine test in February, 2016.

11. On February 13, 2018, Respondent ordered an electrocardiogram and a referral to
cardiology for Patient A, twelve (12) months after Patient A’s first abnormal NT-proBNP results.

12. On March 21, 2018, Patient A was seen by a cardiologist and an echocardiogram
and electrocardiogram were performed, among other tests. The results showed a diminished
ejection fraction of 20-25%, hypokinesis, multiple valvular abnormalities, and an inferior wall
ischemia.

13. Respondent informed Patient A on March 29, 2018, of the echocardiogram results
and recommend further provoked urine testing for lead levels. Respondent also ordered tests for
Lyme disease, Ehrlichiosis, and Babesia without a clinical indication that these tests were
necessary in her records.

14. On June 29, 2018, and again on July 3, 2018, Respondent reported a positive test
result for antibodies to Lyme disease, Ehrlichiosis, and Babesia. Respondent recommended
multiple supplements for treatment, despite clearly labeled negative lab results for both Lyme
disease and Ehrlichiosis. Respondent notes Patient A’s NT-proBNP was 3507 on July 3, 2018.

15. During the course of Patient A’s treatment with Respondent, Respondent
continually failed to note the importance of consistently high lab markers indicating heart failure
in Patient A, who had previously been hospitalized for sustained ventricular tachycardia.
Respondent repeatedly ordered provoked urine testing utilizing DMSA for lead toxicity with no
documented neurologic deficits, complaints or history that suggested exposure to lead, despite the
February 24, 2016, test showing normal lead levels. Furthermore, Respondent ordered tests for
Lyme disease and its co-infections for Patient A without documenting a reason for these tests and
reported a positive test result to the Patient on two occasions, despite clear negative lab results.

COUNT I-II
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

16. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

17. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

18. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

19. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent
committed malpractice by failing to understand and appropriately evaluate Patient A’s abnormal
lab results. Respondent failed to appreciate the significance of Patient A’s consistently raised
NT-proBNP and react appropriately, despite Patient A’s history of ventricular tachycardia.

20. Respondent also failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily
used under similar circumstances when rendering medical services to Patient A as demonstrated
by the Respondent’s delay in appropriately evaluating the Patient’s sustained elevated
NT-proBNP which led to a significant delay in treatment and harm to Patient A.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.306(1)(g) - Continual Failure to Exercise Skill or Diligence

22. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

23. Continual failure by the Respondent to exercise the skill or diligence or use the
methods ordinarily exercised under the same circumstances by physicians in good standing
practicing in the same specialty or field is grounds for disciplinary action against a licensee
pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(g).

24. Respondent continually failed to exercise skill or diligence as demonstrated by her
repeated inability to appreciate the cause of an elevated NT-proBNP, instead diagnosing it as a
marker of inflammation and elevated lead levels which were the result of provoked urine testing.
Respondent repeatedly ordered provoked lead urine tests, instead of an electrocardiogram or
echocardiogram, with no indicators for lead exposure.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IV
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation —
Failure to Consult

26. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

27. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

28. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

29. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition from February 24, 2016, through February 13, 2018. Respondent should have consulted
with an appropriate care provider to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s
medical condition and such a timely consultation would have confirmed or denied such a
diagnosis and may have enhanced the quality of medical care provided to Patient A, with regard to

her heart condition.

30. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

reference as though fully set forth herein.

32. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

33. Respondent failed to maintain proper medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment, and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document her clinical reasoning when
ordering tests for Lyme disease and its coinfections as well as erroneously informing the Patient of
positive test results on labs clearly marked negative.

34. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
