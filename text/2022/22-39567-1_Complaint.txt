4. Respondent’s prescriptions of methadone to Patient A were subject to the standards
set forth in the Model Policy on the Use of Opioid Analgesics in the Treatment of Chronic Pain,
July 2013 (Model Policy). See NAC 630.187 (adopting the Model Policy by reference);
NAC 630.230(1)(k) (providing that a physician shall not write prescriptions for controlled
substances to treat acute or chronic pain in a manner that deviates from the policies adopted by
reference in NRS 630.187).

5. Respondent failed to document that his prescriptions of methadone to Patient A
complied with the Model Policy, including that he failed to document: (1) completion of an
appropriately detailed evaluation prior to prescribing methadone; (2) that he considered
alternatives before prescribing methadone; (3) any assessment of Patient A’s risk for medication
misuse or abuse; (4) that he discussed with Patient A the risks and benefits of opioid therapy and
potential for addiction; (5) that he investigated or confirmed Patient A’s other current and past
treatments for pain; (6) the effect of pain on Patient A’s physical or psychological functioning; (7)
that he established goals or treatment plans for Patient A’s long-term use of methadone; (8) that he
established objectives for evaluating the efficacy of Patient A’s long-term use of methadone; or
(9) that he conducted periodic or random drug testing of Patient A.

6. Respondent also failed to document that he consulted the Nevada Prescription
Monitoring Program (PMP) to ascertain if Patient A was being prescribed opioids by another
prescriber, as required by NRS 639.23507.

7. More than once, Respondent prescribed high doses of methadone to Patient A over
a significant period without documenting an intervening examination or interaction with
Patient A. For example, between February 2014 and February 2015, Respondent wrote at least
nine (9) prescriptions to Patient A, each consisting of seven hundred twenty (720) tablets of 10 mg
methadone, without any documentation that he saw Patient A in his office. Thus, during this
interval of more than a year, Respondent prescribed six thousand four hundred eighty (6,480)
tablets of methadone to Patient A without documenting an intervening doctor-patient meeting,
evaluation of the effects of methadone on the patient and any corresponding adjustments, drug

testing of Patient A, or consultation of the PMP.

8. Respondent’s records indicate that he saw Patient A in his office on April 28, 2015,
when he again prescribed him seven hundred twenty (720) tablets of 10 mg methadone for thirty
(30) days. Respondent wrote refills for this prescription eight (8) times before he next
documented a visit with Patient A on March 15, 2016. Thus, during this interval of almost eleven
(11) months, Respondent prescribed five thousand seven hundred sixty (5,760) tablets of
methadone to Patient A without documenting an intervening doctor-patient meeting, evaluation of
the effects of methadone on Patient A and any corresponding adjustments, drug testing of
Patient A, or consultation of the PMP.

COUNT I
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

9. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

10. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

11. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment, and care of Patient A by failing to document that he complied with the Model Policy or
made required queries of the PMP, see NRS 639.23507, with respect to his prescriptions of
methadone to Patient A.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
