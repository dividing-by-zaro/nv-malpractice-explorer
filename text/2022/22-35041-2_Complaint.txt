part, the radiologist who performed the MRI found that the lumbar segments between Patient A’s
12 and L3 vertebrae (L2-3)’ and between his L3 and L4 vertebrae (L3-4) were essentially normal:

L2-3: No significant spinal canal or foraminal') narrowing.

L3-4: Mild annular") bulge not resulting in significant spinal canal
nor significant foraminal narrowing.

The radiologist found mild-to-moderate issues with the vertebral segments between Patient A’s L4

and LS vertebrae (L4-5) and at the lumbosacral joint between the L5 and the sacrum (L5-S1):

L4-5: Mild broad-based annular bulge with a left central to
paracentral tiny annular fissure. No significant spinal canal
narrowing. No significant foraminal narrowing.

L5-S1: Mild broad-based annular bulge not resulting in significant
spinal canal narrowing. Mild-to-moderate right and mild left
foraminal narrowing.

The radiologist recorded his overall impression regarding Patient A’s spine as:

1. Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine not resulting in
significant spinal canal narrowing. Foraminal narrowing is most
notable on the right at L5-S1 (mild to moderate).

2. No abnormal enhancement within the spinal canal.

4. Patient A was referred to Respondent for consultation regarding his back pain, and
Patient A first presented to Respondent’s clinic on April 14, 2016.

5. On his intake paperwork at Respondent’s clinic, Patient A indicated that he had not
tried epidural steroid injections, trigger point injections, chiropractic therapy, or physical therapy
for his back pain; the paperwork also asked whether he had tried pain management, but this
question was unanswered on the paperwork.

6. Respondent’s record of the April 14, 2016, encounter indicated that Patient A had

“been through extensive conservative treatment, including physical therapy and pain management

are seven; the thoracic vertebrae, situated below the cervical vertebrae, of which there are twelve; and the lumbar
vertebrae situated below the thoracic vertebrae, of which there are five. The letters ‘C,’ ‘T,’ and ‘L’ are used
respectively to designate cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. The sacrum is located at the base of the spinal
column and below it, the coccyx or ‘tailbone.’ The five sacral and four coccygeal vertebrae are fused and together are
considered one bone.” Mousseau v. Schwartz, 756 N.W.2d 345, 347 n.2 (S.D. 2008).

which unfortunately did not improve his condition.” Respondent did not explain the discrepancy
between these statements and Patient A’s intake paperwork.

7. Respondent further stated that his own interpretation of the MRI done on
December 30, 2015, along with his “[d]irect visualization . . . demonstrate[d] severe degenerative
changes at the L4-L5 and LS-S1 level, a loss of disc height as well as the bilateral foraminal
stenosis,‘ causing compression of the nerve roots.” Respondent indicated that he planned to
perform “Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion w/Wide Decompression" [at] L45 L5S1”8 on
Patient A.

8. Patient A had a second visit with Respondent on May 26, 2016, for a preoperative
consultation. Respondent’s record of that encounter reiterated that Patient A was “scheduled to
undergo transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with decompression at L4-5 L5-S1 on 6/3/2016.”

9. Respondent’s records of his two (2) preoperative meetings with Patient A discussed
only the L4-5 and L5-S1 segments of Patient A’s spine; the L3-4 segment was never mentioned.

10. On the “Surgery & Procedure Scheduling Form” filed with the hospital regarding
the June 3, 2016, procedure, which was signed by Respondent, in the space for “Procedure as it is
to appear on the Consent,” was entered: “TRANFORAMINAL LUMBAR INTERBODY
FUSION FOUR TO SACRAL ONE.”®

11. On the morning of June 3, 2016, Patient A presented to Spring Valley Hospital
Medical Center for the planned transforaminal lumber interbody fusion with decompression at his
L4-5 and L5-S1 vertebral segments.

12. Although Patient A’s preoperative MRI report indicated that Patient A’s L3-4

segment had no “significant spinal canal nor significant foraminal narrowing,” and the L3-4

© Stenosis refers to narrowing of the spinal canal or foramina; such “narrowing puts pressure on [the] nerves
and spinal cord and can cause pain.” See “Spinal Stenosis,” https://medlineplus.gov/spinalstenosis.html (last visited
October 24, 2022).

7 In the context of spinal surgery, decompression refers to the surgical relief of pressure on the spinal cord or
nerves.

* “To accomplish the fusion during [transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion] surgery, two rods are placed
lengthwise on either side of the spine and attached with screws into the pedicle bones of the spine. This bracing
provides stability, while a small metal cage with bone-growth material is placed between the vertebra to facilitate new
bone growth and fusion of the spine.” Knight v. Clark, 283 So. 3d 1111, 1124 (Miss. Ct. App. 2019) (Westbrooks, J.,
dissenting) (internal footnotes omitted).

° This is consistent with the plan recorded in Respondent's records of Patient A’s preoperative encounters, as
lumbar “four to sacral one” encompasses the L4-5 and L5-S1 vertebral segments.

vertebral segment was not mentioned in Respondent’s preoperative records, Respondent evidently
calculated that the L3-4 segment was a prospect for surgery, as he arranged for the addition of that
level to Patient A’s relevant surgical consent paperwork prior to actually performing the surgery.

13. The hospital’s record of medical orders related to Patient A’s admission shows that
on the morning of June 3, 2016, Respondent directed hospital personnel to “add to surgical
consent: possible lumbar 3 to 4.”

14. Consequently, on the relevant “Consent to Surgery or Special Diagnostic, Invasive
or Therapeutic Procedures,” on the blank lines following the typewritten statement “Your
surgeons/physicians have recommended the following operation or procedure:” was handwritten
“Transforaminal lumber Interbody Fusion lumbar four to sacral one”; appended thereto was a
second handwritten phrase “possible lumber three to four,” with Patient A’s initials next to the
apparent addition of L3-4 (Patient A’s full signature appeared at the bottom of the form in the
space labeled “Signature of Consenting Party”).

15. Additionally, the “Pre-Procedure Site Verification Note” signed and dated on the
morning of June 3, 2016, which contains a drawing of a human body to allow marking of where a
surgery is to be performed, contains a handwritten phrase to the right of the drawing which reads:
“Transforaminal Lumber Interbody Fusion Four to Sacral One”; added below is a second
handwritten phrase: “possible lumbar three to lumbar four,” which also appears to be initialed by
Patient A (Patient A’s full signature was at the bottom of the form in the space labeled “Patient or
Legal Representative Signature”).

16. During the June 3, 2016, surgery, in addition to performing the planned procedures
at the L4-5 and L5-S1 segments, Respondent operated on the L3-4 segment of Patient A’s spine.

17. Inhis operative report of the June 3, 2016, surgery, Respondent stated that he made
an intraoperative decision to extend the surgery to the L3-4 segment based on the segment’s

appearance:

The L3-L4 segment was examined and appeared to be grossly
abnormal showing significant amount of instability present. Per my
previous discussion with the patient and to accomplish better clinical
postoperative outcome, it was decided to incorporate the L3-L4
segment in a construct... ..


OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

18. Respondent failed to explain in his operative report why the L3-4 segment was
“examined” in the midst of the June 3, 2016, surgery when the preoperative MRI showed it was
essentially normal, with no significant canal or foraminal narrowing, and thus not a reasonable
candidate for surgery.

19. Neither did Respondent explain how Patient A’s L3-4 segment was “examined” in
the midst of the June 3, 2016, surgery, when mere appearance of the segment would be
insufficient to demonstrate instability and physical manipulation of the segment would be
unwarranted.

20. Nor did Respondent explain what criteria he used to determine the L3-4 segment
was “grossly abnormal” or provide any objective measurement of its alleged instability.

21. Finally, Respondent did not reconcile that prior to the surgery, he procured
Patient A’s consent to possibly operate on the L3-4 level, while in his operative report he states
that he decided to operate on that level intraoperatively.

22. A neurosurgeon would not ordinarily “examine” the stability of a spinal segment
during a surgery being performed on other spinal segments, and the “appearance” of a spinal
segment is not sufficient to support a clinical determination regarding its stability.

23.  Respondent’s statement in his operative report that Patient A’s L3-4 segment was
“examined” in the midst of surgery and “appeared to be grossly abnormal showing significant
amounts of instability” is not sufficient justification for a reasonable neurosurgeon to fuse a
lumbar segment.

24. Respondent fused the L3-4 segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine in the absence of,
sufficient evidence that such a procedure was medically necessary or advantageous to Patient A.

25. A neurosurgeon exercising the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
in performing spinal surgery would not fuse the L3-4 segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine in the
absence of sufficient evidence that it was medically necessary or advantageous to do so.

26. In agreeing to allow Respondent to operate on his spine, Patient A placed his trust
in Respondent to perform the procedure he represented he would and to exercise appropriate care

of Patient A during the planned surgery.

27.  Respondent’s extension of the planned surgery to include fusion of the L3-4
segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine was completed while Patient A was unconscious and thus
exceedingly vulnerable.

28. Fusing an additional segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine and correspondingly
increasing the spinal hardware used during the spinal surgery increased the amount that could be
charged for Patient A’s surgery and thus the amount Respondent would be paid for performing the
surgery.

patient and exploits the relationship between the physician and the patient for financial or other
personal gain” constitutes grounds for initiating discipline against a physician.

36. By unnecessarily fusing Patient A’s L3-4 lumbar segment in the midst of surgery
planned for other spinal segments on June 3, 2016, thereby increasing the cost of the surgery and
his corresponding compensation, Respondent engaged in conduct that violated Patient A’s trust
and exploited his relationship with Patient A to realize a financial or other personal gain.

40. Respondent failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A when he failed to include adequate detail in his
operative report of Patient A’s June 3, 2016, spinal surgery as to: (1) why he examined the L3-4
vertebral segment when preoperative imaging showed it was essentially normal; (2) how he
examined the L3-4 vertebral segment; (3) what criteria he used to determine the L3-4 vertebral
segment was “grossly abnormal”; and (4) any objective measurement of the alleged instability of

Patient A’s Second Surgery by Respondent
42. On January 30, 2017, Patient A went to the emergency room at Spring Valley

Hospital Medical Center with low back pain, weakness in his legs that had been getting worse

over the past week, and rectal bleeding. In addressing the back pain and leg weakness, the
emergency room doctor arranged for an x-ray and a computerized tomography (CT) scan of
Patient A’s lumbar spine, as well as consultation by Respondent.

43. The radiologist who completed the x-ray of Patient A’s lumbar spine on
January 30, 2017, noted it showed evidence of the June 3, 2016, surgery and that there was no
fracture of the hardware or sacrum. However, the “L5-S1 interbody spacer [was] retropulsed!'®!
14 mm posteriorly” and there was “lucency associated with the bilateral S1 pedicle screws.” The
radiologist’s impression was that “[t]hese findings suggest hardware loosening.”

44. — The radiologist also completed a CT scan of Patient A’s spine on January 30, 2017,
and noted that, consistent with the x-ray, the images “suggest[ed] hardware loosening” but noted
these findings were “unchanged compared” to a prior CT scan in September 2016. The
radiologist also noted in his impression that there was “[n]o new/acute lumbar spine abnormality
detected.”

45.  Respondent’s notes of his consultation with respect to Patient A on
January 30, 2017, state in pertinent part, that the imaging showed “a retropulsion of the L5-S1
cage compressing the nerve roots and the cauda equina!'") with pseudoarthrosis and loosening of
the L5-S1 screws indicating instability and pseudoarthrosis with a compression of the neural
elements” and that he decided to proceed with an immediate “revision of instrumentation.”

46. The relevant “Consent to Surgery and Other Invasive Procedures” signed and
dated on January 30, 2017, indicates that Patient A authorized Respondent to perform
“REVISION POSTERIOR LUMBAR FUSION LUMBAR THREE TO SACRAL ONE WITH
REVISION OF INSTRUMENTATION.”!?

47. The “Pre-Procedure Site Verification Note” signed and dated on January 30, 2017,
which contains a drawing of a human body to allow marking of where a surgery is to be

performed, contains a handwritten phrase to the right of the drawing which reads: “REVISION

POSTERIOR LUMBAR FUSION LUMBAR THREE TO SACRAL ONE WITH REVISION OF
INSTRUMENTATION.”

48. In his operative report of the January 30, 2017, surgery, Respondent indicated his
preoperative and postoperative diagnoses were identical: “lumbar pseudoarthrosis,!'*) instability,
and instrumentation failure with the compression of the cauda equina.”

49. Respondent further indicated in the operative report, that he removed and replaced
the hardware he had inserted in Patient A’s spine on June 3, 2016.

50. | However, rather than simply revising the instrumentation from the first surgery,
Respondent again fused an additional lumbar segment not previously identified as a candidate for
surgery, this time adding the L2-3 segment to the fusion construct.

51. Similar to his justification for extending Patient A’s first surgery to an additional
lumbar segment, Respondent again relied on his intraoperative “examination” of the target
segment and the alleged lack of stability thereof, stating in the operative report: “The L2-L3
segment was also examined and appeared to be grossly unstable with significant amount of
abnormal motion present.” Also similar to the surprise extension in the prior surgery, Respondent
claimed that his decision to perform such an extension was “[p]er [his] previous discussion with
the patient and to accomplish better neurological outcome.”

52. Reminiscent of the records of the first surgery, in the January 30, 2017, operative
report, Respondent failed to explain why the L2-3 segment was “examined” in the midst of the
surgery when all relevant preoperative imaging showed it was essentially normal, with no
significant canal or foraminal narrowing, and thus not a reasonable candidate for surgery.

53. Respondent also failed to explain how Patient A’s L2-3 segment was “examined”
in the midst of the January 30, 2017, surgery, when the mere appearance of the segment would be
insufficient to demonstrate instability and physical manipulation of the segment would be
unwarranted.


'3 Pseudoarthrosis refers to a failed fusion.

54. Additionally, Respondent did not explain what criteria he used to determine that
the L2-3 segment appeared “grossly unstable” or provide any objective measurement of the
alleged “abnormal motion present.”

55. Prior to the second surgery on January 30, 2017, Respondent indicated he was
“revising” the instrumentation of the June 3, 2016, surgery, that is, fixing the problems with the
hardware from the first surgery.

56. There are no preoperative consent forms documenting that Patient A was informed
that his L2-3 lumbar segment was at risk of being operated upon during the
January 30, 2017, revision surgery.

57. The only reference to Patient A being informed that anything beyond revision of
the hardware from the first surgery was a possibility appears in Respondent’s record of his
January 31, 2017, consultation, which states that after examining Patient A and his CT scan,
Respondent decided to “proceed with the urgent neurological treatment the same date consisting
of a posterior approach the revision of instrumentation,” and states that he and Patient A discussed
“the benefits and risks of such an undertaking,” including “possibility of need of another surgery
in the future as well as the possible extension of the fusion based on intraoperative findings.”
Although the date of consultation was January 30, 2017, the hospital’s records indicate that
Respondent dictated the contents of this record on February 2, 2017, and signed it on
February 6, 2017.

58. A neurosurgeon would not ordinarily “examine” the stability of a spinal segment
during a surgery being performed on other spinal segments, and the “appearance” of a segment is
not sufficient to support a clinical determination regarding its stability.

59.  Respondent’s statement in his January 30, 2017, operative report that Patient A’s
L2-3 segment was “examined” in the midst of surgery and “appeared to be grossly unstable with
significant amount of abnormal motion present” is not sufficient justification for a reasonable
neurosurgeon to fuse a lumbar segment.

60. Respondent fused the L2-3 segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine in the absence of

sufficient evidence that such a procedure was medically necessary or advantageous to Patient A.

61. A neurosurgeon exercising the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
in performing spinal surgery would not fuse the L2-3 segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine in the
absence of sufficient evidence that it was medically necessary or advantageous to do so.

62. In agreeing to allow Respondent to operate on his spine, Patient A placed his trust
in Respondent to perform the procedure he represented he would perform and to exercise
appropriate care of Patient A during the planned surgery.

63. Respondent’s extension of the planned surgery to include fusion of the L2-3
segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine was completed while Patient A was unconscious and thus
exceedingly vulnerable.

64. — Fusing an additional segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine and correspondingly
increasing the spinal hardware used in the surgery increased the amount that could be charged for
Patient A’s surgery and thus the amount Respondent would be paid for performing the surgery.

65. On or about October 3, 2018, Patient A filed a complaint in the Nevada State
District Court for medical malpractice and other claims against Respondent and other defendants.
Respondent was timely served with a summons and complaint and participated in the proceedings.

66. Pursuant to NRS 630.3068(1)(a), a physician is required to report to the Board
“[aJny action for malpractice against the physician not later than 45 days after the physician
receives service of a summons and complaint for the action.”

67. Respondent did not inform the Board of the service of Patient A’s lawsuit against
him within forty-five (45) days of his being served with the summons and complaint in the
matter.'4

68. Pursuant to NRS 630.3068(2), if the Board finds that a physician has violated any
provision of NRS 630.3068, the Board may impose a fine of not more than five thousand dollars
($5,000) against the physician for each violation, in addition to any other fines or penalties
permitted by law.

'S Respondent had a separate responsibility to respond truthfully to questions posed in his next application
for biennial renewal of his medical license. See NRS 630.304(1). In his 2019 renewal application, Respondent was
asked whether during the period of July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2019, he had been “named as a defendant, or been
requested to respond as a defendant, to a legal action involving professional liability [or] malpractice, including any

military tort claims if applicable.” Respondent answered “Y” for “yes,” and when prompted for an explanation
answered: “Claim filed October 2018,” which appears to have referred to Patient A’s lawsuit.

PATIENT B
86. Patient B!> was a thirty-eight (38) year-old male with a history of low back pain
and numbness in his leg when the events described below began.
87. On April 10, 2015, which was almost a year before he met Respondent, Patient B
had an MRI of his lumbar spine. In pertinent part, the radiologist who performed the MRI found

abnormalities of the L5-S1 segment of Patient B’s spine:

There is a grade 1 spondylolisthesis('®) greater than 10% at the level
of LS-Sl. The malalignment is on the basis of bilateral
spondylolysis''”) at L5. No degenerative disc disease. There is
mild/moderate narrowing of the distal most right foramen. This is in
the region of the incompletely imaged findings where S 5!'®) has an
irregular inseparable interface with Sl, appears likely to be
explained by screening which indicated the patient has had prior
trauma, subsequent surgery and hardware removal. If ever indicated
CT could be utilized.

88. The April 2015 MRI images show that Patient B’s L3-4 and L4-5 vertebral
segments were completely normal, and neither of those segments were discussed by the
radiologist.

89. Patient B was referred to Respondent’s clinic for consultation regarding his back
pain, and first presented to Respondent’s clinic on March 29, 2016.

90. Respondent’s record of his March 29, 2016, encounter with Patient B indicates that
his interpretation of the April 2015 MRI, coupled with his own “direct visualization” of Patient B
“demonstrate[d] presence of grade 1 spondylolisthesis at the L5-S1 level with severe bilateral

foraminal stenosis.”

'5 Patient B’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

'6 “Spondylolisthesis” is defined as “forward displacement of a lumbar vertebra on the one below it and
especially of the fifth lumbar vertebra on the sacrum producing pain by compression of nerve roots.”
Spondylolisthesis, https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/spondylolisthesis (last visited October 24, 2022).

irregularity and interface of LS with S1.”

Ol. Respondent’s record further indicated that he planned to perform “Transforaminal
Lumbar Interbody Fusion w/Wide Decompression at L5S1” on Patient B.

92. Patient B had a second visit with Respondent on July 7, 2016, for a preoperative
consultation. Respondent’s record of that encounter reiterated that Patient B was “scheduled to
undergo transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with decompression at L5-S1 on 7/11/16.”

93. Respondent’s records of his two (2) preoperative meetings with Patient B
mentioned only the L5-S1 segment of Patient B’s spine; the L3-4 and L4-5 segments were never
mentioned.

94. On the “Surgery & Procedure Scheduling Form” filed with the hospital regarding
the July 11, 2016, procedure, which was signed by Respondent, in the space for “Procedure as it is
to appear on the Consent,” was entered: “TRANFORAMINAL LUMBAR INTERBODY
FUSION FIVE TO SACRAL ONE.”

95. Additionally, a “Consent to Surgery or Special Diagnostic, Invasive or Therapeutic
Procedures” form signed by Patient B, dated July 8, 2016, indicated that Patient D authorized
Respondent to perform ‘TRANSFORAMINAL LUMBAR INTERBODY FUSION FIVE TO
SACRAL ONE.”

96. On the morning of July 11, 2016, Patient B presented to Centennial Hills Hospital
Medical Center for the planned transforaminal lumber interbody fusion with decompression at his
L5-S1 vertebral level.

97. In his operative report of the July 11, 2016, Respondent stated that after
decompressing the L5-S1 level, he made the intraoperative decision to “incorporate” the L3-4 and
L-5 levels “into the construct,” stating that, “The adjacent levels [were] examined and there
appeared to be [grossly'®] abnormal amount of motion at the L3-L4 and L4-5 level with a
presence of a [pars”°] defect!2") at the L4-L5 level as well which was not appreciated on the
preoperative imaging studies.”


'° The original B operative record states “closely” here, which appears to be a mistranscription of “grossly.”
?° The original B operative record stated “portion” here, which appears to be a mistranscription of “pars.”
2! Spondylolysis is sometimes referred to as a pars defect.

98. Respondent failed to explain in his July 11, 2016, operative report why Patient B’s
L4-5 and L3-4 spinal segments were “examined” in the midst of surgery when the preoperative
MRI showed that those segments were completely normal, and thus not reasonable candidates for
surgery.

99. Respondent also failed to explain how the L4-5 and L3-4 spinal segments were
“examined” in the midst of the July 11, 2016, surgery when mere appearance of the segments
would be insufficient to demonstrate instability and physical manipulation of the segments would
be unwarranted.

100. Further, Respondent failed to explain what criteria he used to determine how the
L4-5 and L3-4 segments exhibited an “abnormal amount of motion” or provide any objective
measurement of such alleged “abnormal amount of motion.”

101. To the extent Respondent refers to the “presence of a [pars] defect at the L4-5
level,” the preoperative MRI contradicts that there was a pars defect at Patient B’s L4-5 vertebral
level.”?

102. Respondent’s records of his two (2) preoperative meetings with Patient B
mentioned only his L5-S1 spinal segment, and did not mention his L3-4 or L4-5 segments.

103. A neurosurgeon would not ordinarily “examine” the stability of a spinal segment
during a surgery being performed on other spinal segments, and the “appearance” of a segment is
not sufficient to support a clinical determination regarding its stability.

104. Respondent’s statement in his July 11, 2016, operative report that Patient B’s L3-4
and L4-5 segments were “examined” in the midst of surgery and “appeared” to exhibit an
“abnormal amount of motion” did not constitute sufficient justification for a reasonable
neurosurgeon to fuse those lumbar segments.

105. Respondents statement in his July 11, 2016, operative report that Patient B’s L4-5
segment had a pars defect is clearly contradicted by the preoperative MRI report and is not

sufficient justification for a reasonable neurosurgeon to fuse that lumbar segment.

If Respondent meant to refer to a “portion defect,” it is not clear what a “portion defect” is; regardless, the
lack of specificity or explanation in his operative report fails to support any operation on the L4-5 level of Patient B’s
spine.

106. Respondent fused the L3-4 and L4-5 segments of Patient B’s lumbar spine in the
absence of sufficient evidence that such procedures were medically necessary or advantageous to
Patient B.

107. A neurosurgeon exercising the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
in performing spinal surgery would not fuse the L3-4 or L4-5 segments of Patient B’s lumbar
spine in the absence of sufficient evidence that it was medically necessary or advantageous to do
so.

108. In agreeing to allow Respondent to operate on his spine, Patient B placed his trust
in Respondent to perform the procedure he represented he would and to exercise appropriate care
of Patient B during the planned surgery.

109. Respondent’s extension of the planned surgery to include fusion of the L3-4 and
L4-5 segments of Patient B’s lumbar spine was completed while Patient B was unconscious and
thus exceedingly vulnerable.

110. Fusing two (2) additional segments of Patient B’s lumbar spine and
correspondingly increasing the spinal hardware used during the spinal surgery increased the
amount that could be charged for Patient B’s surgery and thus the amount Respondent would be
paid for performing the surgery.

111. In his operative report of Patient B’s surgery, Respondent listed among the
procedures performed on Patient B on July 11, 2016: “Placement of the biomechanical device at
the L4-5 and L5-S1 level using Alphatec Battalion peek titanium cage.”

112. Similarly, in the “course of surgery” section of the operative report, Respondent
stated in pertinent part that, “The L4 and L5 laminectomies were performed, and the
biomechanical device was placed at L4-L5 and L5-S1 level using Battalion peek titanium cage
with interbody arthrodesis accomplished at both levels with the use of Vitoss mixed with
autograft.”

113. Contrary to Respondent’s statements in his operative report, subsequent imaging
and a subsequent revision surgery performed by another surgeon made clear that Respondent did



OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

Reno, Nevada 89521
(775) 688-2559


not place a cage or other biomechanical device at Patient B’s L5-S1 level during the
July 11, 2016, surgery.

114. On or about July 11, 2018, Patient B filed a complaint in Nevada State District
Court for medical malpractice and other claims against Respondent. Respondent was timely
served with the complaint and filed a timely answer thereto.

115. Pursuant to NRS 630.3068(1)(a), a physician is required to report to the Board
“[a]ny action for malpractice against the physician not later than 45 days after the physician
receives service of a summons and complain for the action.” ,

116. Respondent did not inform the Board of the service of Patient B’s lawsuit within
forty-five (45) days of him being served with the summons and complaint in the matter.

117. Pursuant to NRS 630.3068(2), if the Board finds that a physician has violated any
provision of NRS 630.3068, the Board may impose a fine of not more than five thousand ($5,000)
against the physician for each violation, in addition to any other fines or penalties permitted by
law.

118. On his 2019 application for biennial renewal of his medical license, Respondent
was asked whether during the period of July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2019, he had been “named
as a defendant, or been requested to respond as a defendant, to a legal action involving
professional liability [or] malpractice, including any military tort claims if applicable” (renewal
question). Respondent answered “Y” for “yes.”

119. When he answered yes to the renewal question, Respondent was prompted to
answer a follow-up question: “For the above [renewal] question if your answer is “Yes” for the
time period July 1, 2017 — July 1, 2019, or since your last renewal, please type your explanation in
this text box.” In this text box, Respondent answered merely: “Claim filed October 2018.”

120. It appears the “Claim filed October 2018” referred to another lawsuit that indeed
was filed against Respondent in October 2018; Respondent failed to accurately include in his
renewal application the malpractice suit filed against him by Patient B on July 11, 2018.

patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

124. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when during the surgery planned for Patient B’s L5-S1 segment on
July 11, 2016, he also fused the patient’s L3-4 and L4-5 lumbar segments without sufficient
evidence that such additional procedures were medically necessary.

125. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

131. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

132. Respondent failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient B when he falsely stated in his operative report of
Patient B’s July 11, 2016, spinal surgery that he had placed a biomechanical device at Patient B’s
L5-S1 vertebral segment on that date.

133. Respondent further failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records
relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient B when he failed to include adequate detail
in his operative report of Patient B’s July 11, 2016, spinal surgery as to: (1) why he examined the
L3-4 and L4-5 vertebral segments when preoperative imaging showed they were normal; (2) how
he examined the L3-4 and L4-5 vertebral segments; (3) what criteria he used to determine the L3-
4 and L4-5 vertebral segments exhibited an “abnormal amount of motion”; and (4) any objective

137. Respondent violated NRS 630.3068(1)(a) by failing to report to the Board that
Patient B had filed a lawsuit against him alleging a claim for medical malpractice within forty-five
(45) days after being served with a summons and complaint in the matter.

139. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference
as though fully set forth herein.

140. NRS 630.304(1) provides that obtaining, maintaining or renewing a license to
practice medicine by bribery, fraud or misrepresentation or by any false, misleading, inaccurate or
incomplete statement constitutes grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

141. In his 2019 application to renew his medical license, when asked whether he had
been “named as a defendant. . . to a legal action involving professional liability [or] malpractice”
from July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2019, Respondent answered that a single complaint had been
filed against him in October 2018, and failed to include that he had also been so named in a
complaint filed by Patient B on July 11, 2018, which was false, misleading, inaccurate or
incomplete.

PATIENT C

143. Patient C?> was a sixty-one (61) year-old female with a history of low back pain
and sciatica when the events described below began.

144. On June 15, 2015, which was approximately eight (8) months before she met
Respondent, Patient C had a CT scan of her lumbar spine. In pertinent part, the radiologist who
performed the CT scan determined that there was no fracture or dislocation of Patient C’s spine,


3 Patient C’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

and that her LS vertebra was degenerating on both sides of her spine but was not displaced;
specifically, the radiologist’s impression was:

1. There is LS5_ bilateral chronic spondylolysis without
spondylolisthesis.
2. There is no acute fracture or dislocation.

145. Patient C presented to Respondent’s clinic for the first time on February 23, 2016.
Respondent’s record of that encounter indicates that he reviewed the CT scan from June 2015 and,
consistent with the CT radiologist, determined that it “demonstrated presence of pars defect at the
L5-S1 level” but contrary to the radiologist, stated that it was “with the presence of
spondylolisthesis” (emphasis added).

146. Respondent’s record of the February 23, 2016, visit also indicates that he
recommended Patient C get a “STAT MRI of the lumbar spine for further evaluation of her
symptoms,” and discussed with Patient C “the possibility of a surgical treatment which we will
further discuss based on the MRI result.”

147. Patient C apparently did not undergo an MRI of her lumbar spine prior to
presenting to the emergency room at Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center five (5) days after
meeting Respondent, on February 28, 2016, for worsening back pain radiating to her right leg.

148. The attending physician in the emergency room recorded that Patient C “was told
by [Respondent] to come in if pain gets worse.” Respondent was consulted via telephone by
medical staff at the hospital.

149. On the same day she went to the emergency room, Patient C had an MRI of her
lumbar spine. The radiologist who performed the MRI found a “large right lateral disk

herniation” at Patient C’s L3-4 vertebral level, but no stenosis at any other level of her spine:

Vertebral bodies align normally. There are no compression fractures.
Marrow signal is normal. Small cysts are identified in the right
kidney.

At L1-L2 there is no central or neural foraminal stenosis.

At L2-3 no central or neural foraminal stenosis.

At L3-4 there is a large right lateral disk herniation causing mass
effect upon the right L3 and L4 nerve roots. Lesion shows mild

"1

cranial migration posterior to the L3 vertebral body and results in the
severe narrowing of the lateral recess and neural foramen. The
craniocaudal measurement of the herniation is 2.6 cm with an AP
measurement of 7 mm and a transverse measurement of 11 mm. The
central canal and left neuroforamen are patent.

L4-5 there is moderate facet arthropathy no central or neural
foraminal stenosis.

At L5-S1 facet arthropathy is present. No central or neural foraminal
stenosis.

The radiologist’s impression was:

Large right disk herniation at L3-4. This results in neural foraminal
stenosis and lateral recess stenosis with mass effect upon the right
L3 and descending L4 nerve roots.

150. Hospital records indicate Respondent instructed hospital staff to admit Patient C
and prepare her for spinal surgery the next day, February 29, 2016.

151. There is no documentation that Patient C tried physical therapy or interventional
pain management prior to her surgery, or that Respondent inquired into such treatment prior to
ordering that she undergo spinal surgery.

152. Documentation related to the surgery indicates it was unclear to the participants
which vertebral levels Respondent would be operating on. In a subsequent lawsuit filed by Patient
C against Respondent, Patient C asserted that she believed Respondent was going to perform a
fusion on a single level: L5-S1.

153. Meanwhile, the hospital’s records indicate that Patient C signed consent paperwork
for posterior lumbar decompression and fusion at two (2) other levels, L3-4 and L4-5. The
“Consent to Surgery or Special Diagnostic, Invasive or Therapeutic Procedures,” signed by
Patient C on the morning of her surgery, noted in pertinent part that her “surgeons/physicians have
recommended the following operation or procedure: “Posterior Lumbar decompression and
Fusion Lumbar Three four and four five.” Similarly, the “Pre-Procedure Site Verification Note,”
signed by Patient C on the morning of her surgery also indicated that her procedure would consist

of “Posterior Lumbar Decompression + Fusion Lumbar three, four +four five.”

154. And Respondent’s operative report of the February 29, 2016, surgery indicates
Respondent told Patient C that he would be operating on all three (3) levels: “After detailed
discussion with the patient given the presence of neurological deficit and the presence of
instability in the lumbar spine it was decided to proceed with the surgical treatment consisting of
L3-S1 lumbar decompression and fusion.”

155. Contrary to Respondent’s reference to “the presence of instability in the lumbar
spine,” neither the CT scan nor the MRI demonstrated instability of Patient C’s lumbar spine.

156. Respondent apparently did not record any presurgical examination of Patient C on
February 29, 2016, other than that set forth in his operative report: “On physical examination, she
had weakness in her iliopsoas with 4/5 as well as the dorsiflexion weakness on the or [sic] right
side with 4/5 and progressive worsening of the numbness in her lower extremities.”

157. Ultimately, Respondent operated on three (3) levels of Patient C’s spine on
February 29, 2016: first, the L3-4; then the L5-S1; and finally, the L4-5.

158. The sizable disk herniation at Patient C’s L3-4 segment indicated a discectomy at
that level was a reasonable treatment, however, as there was no stenosis or instability at that level,
fusing the L3-4 segment was neither medically necessary nor advantageous to Patient C.

159. A neurosurgeon exercising the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
in performing spinal surgery would not fuse the L3-4 segment of Patient C’s lumbar spine in the
absence of sufficient evidence that it was medically necessary or advantageous to do so.

160. After a decompression and fusion at the L3-4 level “was accomplished,
[Respondent’s] attention was turned to the L5 and S1 level with pars defect,” which he also fused.
As spondylolysis can be a source of chronic back pain, fusion at L5-S1 was arguably reasonable.

161. Although no evidence existed that Patient C had any issues at her L4-5 vertebral
level that required surgical attention, Respondent next fused her L4-5 level based on an
interoperative “appearance” of “instability,” which he documented with a single sentence: “The
L4-L5 segment was also [sic] appeared to be unstable and it was decided to incorporate this into
the construct.”



Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
9600 Gateway Drive
Reno, Nevada 89521
(775) 688-2559

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


162. The appearance of a vertebral segment is not sufficient to support a clinical
determination of its stability.

163. Respondent did not explain in his February 29, 2016, operative report what criteria
he used to determine the L4-5 segment was unstable, nor did he provide any objective
measurement of its alleged instability.

164. As there was no stenosis or instability at Patient C’s L4-5 segment, fusion of this
level was neither medically necessary nor advantageous.

165. Respondent’s records do not reconcile why, prior to the surgery, he procured
Patient C’s written consent to fuse the L4-5 level, but his operative report indicates his decision to
operate on the L4-5 level was made intraoperatively.

166. Respondent fused the L4-5 segment of Patient C’s lumbar spine in the absence of
sufficient evidence that such a procedure was medically necessary or advantageous to Patient C.

167. A neurosurgeon exercising the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
in performing spinal surgery would not fuse the L4-5 segments of Patient C’s lumbar spine in the
absence of sufficient evidence that it was medically necessary or advantageous to do so.

168. In agreeing to allow Respondent to operate on her spine, Patient C placed her trust
in Respondent to perform the procedure he represented he would and to exercise appropriate care
of Patient C during the planned surgery.

169. Respondent’s (1) fusion of the L3-4 segment of Patient C’s lumbar spine when
only a discectomy was called for at the level, and (2) fusion of the L4-5 level in the absence of
sufficient evidence that such procedure was necessary, were completed while Patient C was
unconscious and thus exceedingly vulnerable.

170. Fusing segments of Patient C’s lumbar spine that did not require them and
increasing the spinal hardware used during the spinal surgery increased the amount that could be
charged for Patient C’s surgery and correspondingly, the amount Respondent would be paid for
performing the surgery.

NRS 630.301(7) — Engaging in Conduct That Violates the Trust of a Patient and Exploits
the Relationship With the Patient for Financial or Other Personal Gain

181. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

182. NRS 630.301(7) provides that “engaging in conduct that violates the trust of the
patient and exploits the relationship between the physician and the patient for financial or other
personal gain” constitutes grounds for initiating discipline against a physician.

183. By unnecessarily fusing Patient C’s L3-4 and L4-5 lumbar segments in the midst of
surgery, thereby increasing the cost of the surgery and his corresponding compensation,
Respondent engaged in conduct that violated Patient C’s trust and exploited his relationship with
Patient C to realize a financial gain.

184. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT XVI
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Accurate Medical Records

185. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

186. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

187. Respondent failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient C because his operative report of Patient C’s February
29, 2016, spinal surgery: (1) stated that he was operating in part to address “the presence of
instability in the lumbar spine” when preoperative imagining did not demonstrate any instability;

and (2) failed to include adequate detail explaining why or how he examined the L4-5 vertebral

segment, what criteria he used to determine the L4-5 vertebral level “appeared to be unstable,” or
any objective measurement of the alleged instability of the L4-5 vertebral segment.

188. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

PATIENT D

189. Patient D** was a seventy-five (75) year-old female with a history of low back pain
when the events described below began.

190. On August 27, 2015, which was approximately three (3) months before she met
with Respondent, Patient D had an MRI of her lumbar spine. In pertinent part, the radiologist who
performed the MRI found nonexistent to mild stenosis of the central spinal canal; insignificant to

mild foraminal stenosis; and minimal spondylolisthesis at the L1-2 vertebral level:

L1-L2: Broad-based disk bulge, eccentric toward the right, flattening
the ventral thecal sac. Minimal retrolisthesis of L1 on L2.%51 No
significant spinal stenosis. Midline AP thecal sac diameter 12 mm.

Mild flattening of the right lateral recess. Mild right neural
foraminal narrowing. Slight progression since previous.

L2-L3: Mild broad-based disk bulge and posterior osteophyte
formation, slightly impressing upon the ventral thecal sac. No spinal
stenosis. Facet hypertrophy and ligamentum flavum thickening are
present with impression upon the right dorsal sac thecal sac. Mild
right neural foraminal narrowing. No significant interval change.

L3-L4: Mild broad-based disk bulge, slightly flattening the thecal
sac. Left foraminal lateral bulge or [sic] No spinal stenosis. Midline
thecal sac diameter 13 mm. Mild facet hypertrophy present. No
significant canal stenosis. Mild inferior left neural foraminal
narrowing. Little interval change.

L4-L5: 3mm diffuse disk bulge, which flattens the ventral thecal sac.
When combined with ligamentum flavum thickening and facet
hypertrophy, there is mild lateral recess narrowing. Midline AP
thecal sac diameter 10 mm, with mild spinal canal stenosis. Facet
hypertrophy contributes to mild left neural foraminal narrowing,
similar to previous.

L5-S1: Broad-based disk bulge, with 3.5 mm central disk protrusion.
This slightly indents the ventral thecal sac, without significant spinal

Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

lower body.” Redmann v. Martin’s Wine Cellar, 51 So. 3d 41, 45 n.4 (La. Ct. App. 2010) (internal quotation
omitted).

stenosis. Midline AP thecal sac diameter 12 mm. Moderate facet
arthropathy and synovitis cyst associated with facet joints. No
significant neural foraminal compromise.

(Emphases added.)

191. Patient D was referred to Respondent’s clinic for consultation regarding her back
pain, and first presented to Respondent’s clinic on December 8, 2015.

192. Respondent’s records of his encounter with Patient D on December 8, 2015, refer
to a “[c]omprehensive intake sheet filled out by the patient, [which was] reviewed, scanned and
made part of the patient’s record.” However, the records provided to the Board by Respondent
pursuant to NRS 629.061(1)(g) did not contain such a comprehensive intake sheet.

193. Respondent’s record of the encounter with Patient D on December 8, 2015,
indicated in part: “Direct visualization and independent interpretation of MRI of the lumbar spine
demonstrates severe degenerative changes with the presence of scoliosis and post kyphoplasty!41
changes of LI vertebra, with a severe central and foraminal stenosis from L1 to S1, with a various
degree of spondylolisthesis at the L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels.”

194. Respondent’s statement that the MRI showed “severe” central stenosis from the LI
segment to the S1 segment of Patient D’s spine was false and directly contradicted by the MRI,
which showed no significant spinal stenosis at L1-2 and L5-S1; no spinal stenosis at L2-3 and L3-
4; and only mild spinal canal stenosis at L4-5.

195. Respondent’s statement that the MRI showed “severe” foraminal stenosis from L1
to S1 is likewise contradicted by the MRI image showing mild or no significant foraminal
narrowing.

196. The only finding on the MRI that there was any spondylolisthesis in Patient D’s

spine was a reference to “minimal retrolisthesis” at her L1-2 vertebral level, and thus

26 Patient D apparently had a kyphoplasty approximately five (5) months prior to meeting Respondent.
“During [a kyphoplasty], the patient is placed prone on an operating table and the level of fracture of the vertebra is
identified using a fluoroscope. A ‘K-wire’ (a large-diameter device with a pointed end) is inserted through the skin
into the pedicle (a conduit into the vertebral body). A drill is used to penetrate the pedicle, and a portion of the sheath
is pulled out and replaced with a cannula (a tube used for delivery of material into the vertebra). A balloon is inserted
into the drill hole to the proper depth, and the balloon is tamped and filled with water. This decompresses the vertebra,
creating a space into which bone cement is injected and allowed to harden. The bone cement remains in the space
permanently.” Baker v. Texas Med. Bd., No. 03-12-00313-CV, 2013 WL 490749, at *2 (Tex. App. Feb. 6, 2013)

Respondent’s claim that the MRI showed spondylolisthesis at Patient D’s L3-4, L4-5, and L5-SI
vertebral levels was false.

197. Patient D’s preoperative imaging supported nothing more extensive than a simple
decompression at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels, however, Respondent recommended to Patient D
“surgical treatment consisting of posterior approach with L1 to S1 lumbar decompression and
fusion.”

198. Patient D had a second visit with Respondent on February 4, 2016, for a
preoperative consultation, when he reiterated that Patient D was “scheduled to undergo LI to S1
lumbar decompression and fusion.”

199. On the morning of February 10, 2016, Patient D presented to Southern Hills
Hospital and Medical Center for the planned surgery.

200. In his operative report of the February 10, 2016, surgery, Respondent explained
that he began the operation by decompressing and fusing Patient D’s L1-2 and L2-3 vertebral
segments.

201. Before Respondent moved on to the rest of the planned surgery, Patient D
exhibited cardiac abnormalities; although Respondent decided to abridge the procedure, he also

proceeded to fuse Patient D’s L1 to LS lumbar levels:

they [sic] were some irregularities in the blood pressure and cardiac
rhythm noted, which quickly normalized. The patient remained
stable hemodynamically. Because of the concern for a cardiac
abnormality, intraoperatively it was decided to shorten the procedure
and the Alphatec pedicle screws were placed at the L1, L2, L3, L4
and LS levels bilaterally to address severe instability present at the
lower lumbar segments. ... The screws were connected with rods
and crosslinks. The exposed body surfaces were decorticated and L1
to LS posterolateral arthrodesis was accomplished with the use of
VITOSS mixed with autograft. The patient at the time of the
extubation was stable hemodynamically, was taken to recovery in
stable condition. Cardiology consult was called to workup potential
cardiac issues.

202. An amendment to the February 10, 2016, operative report indicated that the

“cardiac issues” experienced by Patient D during the surgery were somewhat serious, noting that

“per anesthesiologist, [Patient D] had bradycardia”! and ST elevation’*! and required 2 units of
blood to be given intraoperatively.”

203. There was no preoperative evidence of significant stenosis or instability in
Patient D’s L1-2, L2-3, or L3-4 vertebral segments and no medically necessary basis for
Respondent to fuse or otherwise operate on them.

204. A neurosurgeon exercising the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
in performing spinal surgery would not fuse the L1-2, L2-3, or L3-4 segments of Patient D’s
lumbar spine in the absence of sufficient evidence that it was medically necessary or advantageous
to do so.

205. The mild stenosis at Patient D’s L4-5 and L5-S1 spinal segments arguably
supported simple decompression at those levels of her spine; ironically, these segments were not
decompressed during Patient D’s February 10, 2016, surgery.

206. In agreeing to allow Respondent to operate on her spine, Patient D placed her trust
in Respondent to perform medically necessary procedures.

207. Fusing segments of Patient D’s spine that did not require it increased the amount
that could be charged for Patient D’s surgery and correspondingly, the amount Respondent would
be paid for performing the surgery.


27 “Bradycardia ... is a slow heart rate. The hearts of adults at rest usually beat between 60 and 100 times a
minute. If you have bradycardia, your heart beats fewer than 60 times a minute. Bradycardia can be a serious problem
if the heart rate is very slow and the heart can’t pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body.” Bradycardia, Mayo
Clinic, at https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bradycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355474 (last visited
October 24, 2022); see also United States v. Beam, 506 F.Supp.3d 1192, 1200 n.8 (N.D. Ala. Dec. 11, 2020) (quoting
similar definition from Mayo Clinic website).

2 The ST-segment is a wave section on an electrocardiogram (EKG).
https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22068-stemi-heart-attack (last visited October 24, 2022). The sensors
from an EKG detect the heart's electrical activity, which is then displayed as a wave pattern, with different parts being
labeled alphabetically from P to U. See id. “When there’s an elevation is the ST segment, that often means there’s a
total blockage of one of the heart’s main supply arteries.” /d. The cardiology consultation following her surgery
indicated that Patient D suffered a postoperative non-ST elevated myocardial infarction.

2° Patient D had two (2) additional spinal surgeries in which Respondent was involved: one (1) in September
2016, which was performed by another surgeon, but assisted by Respondent; and another in January 2017, performed
by Respondent.

reference as though fully set forth herein.

209. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

210. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

211. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when he fused the L1-2, L2-3, and L3-4 lumbar segments of
Patient D’s spine without sufficient evidence that such procedures were medically necessary.

212. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

217. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

218. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

219. Respondent failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient D, as the records he made of her care contained
numerous falsehoods, including that a comprehensive intake sheet was made part of the patient’s
record, that her MRI showed severe central and foraminal stenosis from her L1 to S1 vertebral
segments, and that her MRI showed spondylolisthesis at the L3-4, L4-5, and LS-S1 vertebral
levels.

220. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

PATIENTS A, B, C AND D

221. As demonstrated by the above-outlined facts, Respondent has evinced a pattern of
failing to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used by neurosurgeons in good
standing by repeatedly performing unnecessary surgical procedures in the absence of sufficient
evidence that such procedures were medically necessary.

222. In performing unnecessary surgical procedures, Respondent wrongfully increased
the costs of patients’ surgeries, including the cost of the spinal hardware used, and therefore
increased the amount he stood to be compensated for the patients’ surgeries, and has thus
repeatedly violated his patients’ trust and exploited his relationship with such patients in order to
realize a financial gain for himself.

223. Respondent’s repeated violations of the Medical Practice Act as set forth above
undermines the public’s trust and respect for the medical profession and thereby bring the medical

profession into disrepute.
