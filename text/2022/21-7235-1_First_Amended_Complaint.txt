BEFORE THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS

OF THE STATE OF NEVADA
In the Matter of Charges and Case No. 21-7235-1

Complaint Against:
LUKE ST. JOHN CESARETTI, M.D.,

Respondent.

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Ian J. Cumings, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Luke St. John Cesaretti, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1, Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint, a physician licensed to
practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 6238). Respondent was originally licensed
by the Board on June 8, 1991.

A. RESPONDENT’S TREATMENT OF PATIENT A

2. Patient A was a 74-year-old female when she presented to Respondent during the
events relevant to this complaint. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her
privacy, but was disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy
of the original Complaint.

3. On February 22, 2017, Patient A had an initial abdominal ultrasound which

indicated a clear two (2) cm mass in the mid-body of her pancreas.

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members, Chairman Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D,
Victor M. Muro, M.D., and April Mastrolucca.

4. On March 10, 2017, Patient A underwent further evaluation with a CT scan of the
abdomen. The reading radiologist compared the CT with the previous abnormal ultrasound. The
report described a dilated pancreatic duct in the body and tail with atrophy of the tail, but did not
discuss the mass clearly identified on the ultrasound. The pancreatic mass was noted in the
“Clinical History” portion of the Report. Patient A was recommended for further evaluation with
a multiphase MRI out of concern for the abnormal findings on the CT.

5. On March 16, 2017, Patient A presented to Respondent for an MRI due to the
suspicious mass on her pancreas.

6. In the Respondent’s records, he noted that Patient A had a history of an abnormal
pancreas on the March 10, 2017, CT report. Respondent failed to acknowledge the pancreatic
mass noted on the CT report, and made no attempt to obtain Patient A’s prior abnormal
examinations.

7. Respondent failed to review images from Patient A’s February 22, 2017,
ultrasound, and the March 10, 2017, CT scan prior to his interpretation of Patient A’s MRI.
Respondent based his comparison solely on the report of the March 10, 2017, CT scan.

8. Notwithstanding this, the Respondent found that “no pancreatic masses are
discernable” from his interpretation of Patient A’s MRI. Respondent noted a dilated pancreatic
duct and atrophy of the pancreas at the level of ductal dilatation.

9. Within the “Impression” portion of the MRI report, Respondent stated the ductal
dilation could be either developmental or possibly related to a stricture of the duct proximal to the
dilated portion. Respondent failed to specify in Patient A’s medical records, the importance of the
findings and the relationship these findings have to the diagnosis of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma. Specifically, the dilated pancreatic duct indicated a high risk for an underlying
pancreatic cancer. The association with the pancreatic atrophy is another indicator of Patient A's
high risk for underlying cancer which the Respondent failed to alert Patient A’s referring
physician to.

10. On April 7, 2017, Patient A obtained a second opinion, underwent an EUS guided
fine needle aspiration biopsy. The results of the endoscopic procedure were a finding of
malignant cells present, consistent with adenocarcinoma and metastatic adenocarcinoma.

5. All the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

6. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating

to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

8. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he chose not to obtain Patient A’s previous exams, failed to identify the cancerous mass in
Patient A’s pancreas, and failed to alert the referring physician to the gravity of the findings he

described in the MRI report.

COUNT

NRS 630.3062(1) - Failure to Maintain Proper Medical Records

10. All the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

11. NRS 630.3062(1) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate,
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitutes
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

treatment, and care of Patient A, by unconcernedly mentioning a possible developmental lesion on

the MRI report and failing to highlight the potential unacceptable high level of risk of pancreatic

carcinoma for a patient who had two (2) abnormal imaging studies and showed a pancreatic mass
