COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Aaron Bart Fricke, J.D., General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Todd Lincoln Jackson, M.D., (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 13385). Respondent’s
license is now expired”, but was originally licensed by the Board on January 11, 2010.

2. Patient A? was a fifty-six (56) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On or about November 28, 2012, Patient A presented to Respondent for
consultation regarding laser vision enhancement. Patient A had a history of previous refractive

surgery in 2003 that gave her mono vision, with the right eye for near vision and the left eye for

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Victor M. Muro, M.D., Rachakonda Prabhu,
M.D., and Ms. Sandy Peltyn.

2 Pursuant to NRS_ 630.298, the expiration of a license by operation of law or by order or decision of the
Board or a court, or the voluntary surrender of a license by a licensee, does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction to
proceed with any investigation of, or action or disciplinary proceeding against, the licensee or to render a decision
suspending or revoking the license.

3 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

distance. That surgery had worked well for some period of time, but Patient A eventually
underwent a hyperopic shift that resulted in her right eye becoming unable to see well without
correction at near.

4. Respondent correctly determined that a reasonable course of treatment to correct
Patient A’s vision in her right eye would be to perform a photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) on
her right eye to once again make her myopic.

5. On or about December 4, 2012, Respondent performed a pre-operative evaluation
on Patient A for PRK. Respondent’s surgical plan was correctly entered on Respondent’s
standard pre-operative form, which was faxed to Lasik Vision Institute (“LVI”) on December 14,
2012.

6. On or about December 17, 2012, Patient A presented to Respondent at LVI for
PRK surgery on her right eye. Due to an unintentional miscommunication from Respondent to
staff of LVI, the VISX laser was programmed to obtain the opposite result as was intended by
Respondent; the laser was programmed to correct two (2) diopters of myopia instead of creating
two (2) diopters of myopia. The surgery was performed and the laser functioned as programmed,
which caused the opposite result of what was intended.

7. An eye surgeon is professionally responsible for ensuring that laser eye surgery
equipment is programmed correctly so that the correct procedure is performed on the correct eye
of the correct patient.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

9. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating

10. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar

circumstances.”

11. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
