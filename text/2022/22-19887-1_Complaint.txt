chest pain at 5/10 and radiation despite the new medication doses. The nursing staff clarified with

surgery is scheduled for Monday. Orders were issued by Respondent for .5 mcg of metoprolol IV
and to titrate down the nitro drip.

8. At or around 4:30 p.m. the on-call cardiologist was notified that there was no relief
of Patient A’s symptoms of chest pain with radiation to the shoulder and jaw. Orders were issued
for an increase in cardiac medications to be given over time to prevent hypotension. At
