COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through BRANDEE MOONEYHAN, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney
for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that JEFF CHEN, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

I. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 13095). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on April 27, 2009.

2. Respondent also holds an active Nevada Controlled Substance Registration,
Certificate No. CS18013, issued by the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy (Pharmacy Board).

3. On May 26, 2020, the Pharmacy Board filed a “Notice of Intended Action and
Accusation” (Pharmacy Board Accusation) alleging that in December 2019, Respondent was the
medical director of Breathe Bar in Reno, Nevada, and that in such capacity he violated various

statutes and regulations within the Pharmacy Board’s jurisdiction.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ahsan.,

4. In pertinent part, the Pharmacy Board Accusation alleged that with Respondent’s
knowledge and pursuant to his direction, registered nurses employed at Breathe Bar administered
to patients dangerous drugs through intravenous therapy and/or injections without Respondent’s
direct supervision and without Respondent having written a patient- and medication-specific chart
order.

5. The Pharmacy Board Accusation also alleged that Respondent directed the
registered nurses at Breathe Bar to obtain, access, possess, and store dangerous drugs from
Breathe Bar’s inventory when he was not on site.

6. NRS_ 454.213(1)(c) provides that dangerous drugs may be possessed and
administered by a registered nurse “at the direction of a prescribing physician... or pursuant to a
chart order, for administration to a patient at another location.”

7. NRS 454.221 prohibits the furnishing of dangerous drugs without a legal
prescription, except under certain exceptions not applicable here. Specifically, a practitioner like
Respondent may furnish dangerous drugs only to his patients, see NRS 454.221(2)(a), and a
registered nurse may furnish dangerous drugs only while participating in a health program
approved by the Pharmacy Board, see NRS 454.221(2)(c).

8. NRS 454.316 renders it unlawful to possess a dangerous drug “except that
furnished to the person by a pharmacist pursuant to a legal prescription or by a practitioner.”

9. The Pharmacy Board Accusation asserted that by “allowing Breathe Bar’s RN
[registered nurse] staff to operate Breathe Bar and to obtain, access, possess, administer and/or
store dangerous drugs when he was not on site, before he examined the patient, before he wrote a
patient-specific order and without his direct supervision,” Respondent violated, attempted to
violate, assisted or abetted in the violation of, or conspired to violate, among other statutes,
NRS 454.213(1), NRS 454.221, and NRS 454.316.

10. The Pharmacy Board Accusation also alleged that Respondent permitted opened,

undated, multi-dose injectables to be used for the treatment of patients at Breathe Bar.

2 NRS 454.213(1)(d) allows a registered nurse “[e]mployed by a health care agency or health care facility
that is authorized to provide emergency care, or to respond to the immediate needs of a patient, in the residence of the
patient” and “{aJcting under the direction of the medical director of that agency” to possess and administer dangerous
drugs “{iJn accordance with applicable regulations.”

I. NAC 639.67057(2) sets forth requirements for multi-dose drug containers,
including that if the seal of a multi-dose container is breached, the contents may be used within
twenty-eight (28) days after the breach of the seal occurred; otherwise, it may not be used and
must be destroyed. See NAC 639.67057(2)(b), (3).

12. The Pharmacy Board Accusation asserted that by “failing to follow procedures to
reflect expiration dates on opened multi-dose injectable vials,” Respondent violated, assisted or
abetted in the violation of, or conspired to violate NAC 639.67057(2).

13. On or about July 13, 2020, Respondent filed an Answer and Notice of Defense to
the Pharmacy Board Accusation.

14, As of May 8, 2021, the matter against Respondent arising from Pharmacy Board
Accusation remained pending; on May 8, 2021, Respondent completed his 2021 application for
biennial renewal of his medical license. Despite the pending Pharmacy Board matter, on his 2021
renewal application, Respondent falsely answered “no” to a question that asked in-part whether
during the period of July 1, 2019, though June 30, 2021, or since his last renewal, he had been “‘a)
asked to respond to an investigation; b) notified that [he] was under investigation for;
c) investigated for; d) charged with; or e) convicted of any violation of a statute, rule or regulation
governing [his] practice as a physician by any medical licensing board, hospital, medical society,
governmental entity or agency other than the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners.”

15. On or about July 14, 2021, Respondent and the Pharmacy Board entered into a
“Stipulation and Order” (Pharmacy Board Stipulation) whereby Respondent acknowledged that
counsel for the Pharmacy Board “could present such evidence at an administrative hearing to
establish a factual basis” for violations against him, specifically, that he: (1) failed at times to put
into practice policies and procedures within Breath Bar to ensure that dangerous drugs were
stored, possessed, and administered to patients in compliance with NRS 454.213(1), NRS 454.221
and/or NRS 454.316; and (2) failed in one instance to record an expiration date on an opened
multi-dose injectable vial, in violation of NAC 639.67057(2).

16. Respondent accepted the Pharmacy Board Stipulation “as a caution regarding his

duties and responsibilities as a practitioner when authorizing registered nurses to possess and


Examiners

administer dangerous drugs to patients,” and agreed to pay a fine and also to reimburse the
Pharmacy Board for a portion of the costs incurred in investigating and prosecuting the matter.
COUNT I

Nevada State Board of Pharmacy

17. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

holds a license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada.

19. NRS 630.306(1)(b)(3) provides that engaging in conduct that violates a provision
of Chapter 639 of NRS, or a regulation adopted by the Pharmacy Board pursuant thereto, that is
applicable to a licensee who is a practitioner, as defined in NRS 639.0125, is grounds for initiating
discipline against a licensee.

20. NRS 639.210(12) prohibits violating, attempting to violate, assisting or abetting in
the violation of, or conspiring to violate any provisions of Chapter 639 of NRS or any law or
regulation relating to drugs, the manufacture or distribution of drugs or the practice of pharmacy.

21. Respondent violated NRS 639.210(12) by violating laws relating to drugs and/or
the distribution of drugs, specifically, NRS 454.213(1), NRS 454.221 and/or NRS 454.316, when
he failed to ensure that dangerous drugs were legally stored, possessed, and administered to
patients at Breathe Bar.

22. Respondent violated NAC 639.67057(2) by failing to record an expiration date on
an opened multi-dose vial at Breathe Bar.

23. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

25. NRS 630.304(1) provides that obtaining, maintaining or renewing or attempting to
obtain, maintain or renew a license to practice medicine by bribery, fraud or misrepresentation or
by any false, misleading, inaccurate or incomplete statement constitutes grounds for initiating

Respondent falsely answered “no” to a question asking whether he had been “‘a) asked to respond
to an investigation; b) notified that [he was] under investigation for; c) investigated for; d) charged
with; or e) convicted of any violation of a statute, rule or regulation governing [his] practice as a
physician by any medical licensing board, hospital, medical society, governmental entity or
agency other than the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners” from July 1, 2019, through
June 30, 2021, when in fact the Pharmacy Board filed an Accusation against him on
May 26, 2020, charging him with violating statutes and regulations by his actions as a physician
with respect to dangerous drugs.

27. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:
