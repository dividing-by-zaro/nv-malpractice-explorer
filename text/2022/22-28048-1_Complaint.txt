COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Donald K. White, J.D., Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for
the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Ziad Ahmed Sawi, M.D. (Respondent) violated
the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating
the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10533). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 1, 2003.

2. Patient A* was a thirty-six (36) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. On March 2, 2018, Patient A had sustained multiple injuries in a motorcycle
collision. Of these injuries, the pertinent injury was a hangman’s fracture of the neck. Patient A
was scheduled for surgery on March 4, 2018. Respondent was assigned as the anesthesiologist for
the surgery.


1 The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ahsan,

M.D., Ph.D., FACC, and Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.).
2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient

4, During the surgery, ventilation of Patient A became increasingly difficult to
stabilize and had to be turned to the supine position. A bronchoscopy was performed to identify
any obstruction of the endotracheal tube. Patient A was extubated and reintubated, and became
asystolic and eventually lost his life.

5. The medical records prepared by Respondent do not include the exact times of the
bronchoscopy or the second intubation. The records are also not clear on the events that occurred
during the surgery, the inadequacy of the ventilation of Patient A, and whether Patient A was
monitored appropriately during the bronchoscopy and reintubation.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

6. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

7. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

8. NAC. 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

9. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he failed to properly ventilate and monitor Patient A during the surgery on March 4, 2018, causing
hypoxemia, hypoxia and leading to cardiac arrest.

10. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

13. Respondent failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to accurately and completely document
his actions when he treated Patient A.

14. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
