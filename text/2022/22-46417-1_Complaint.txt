NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
IGA

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(Board), by and through Donald K. White, J.D., Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the

IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Elena Geraymovych, M.D. (Respondent) violated the

provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)

Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

lL. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an

active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 16838). Respondent was

originally licensed by the Board on December 13, 2016.

2. Patient A* was a seventy-eight (78) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.
3. On July 31, 2017, Patient A presented to Respondent as a new patient.
4, Patient A complained of vitreous floaters in his eyes, of which Respondent noted

Patient A had significant floaters and recommend vitrectomy surgery.

1 The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Victor M. Muro, M.D., Chairman, Aury Nagy,

5. Respondent’s examination notes revealed healthy eyes and normal optic nerve
examination in both eyes. The notes also reflected pseudophakia and laser scarring in the left eye
from prior laser treatment.

6. Of note, the records also indicated intraocular pressure of 26 in the right eye and 37
in the left eye. There is no comment regarding the elevated intraocular pressure.

7. Patient A was instructed to schedule a pre-operative appointment and to schedule
vitrectomy surgery, but due to another medical issue, Patient A did not return to see Respondent
again until September 27, 2018.

8. On September 27, 2018, Patient A complained of worsening floaters in his eyes,
and wanted to schedule his vitrectomy surgery. His intraocular pressures had increased to 34 in
the right eye and 37 in the left eye.

9. At this visit, Respondent noted the increased pressures, referred Patient A to a
glaucoma specialist, and instructed Patient A to call to schedule his vitrectomy surgery.

10. On October 10, 2018, Patient A saw the glaucoma specialist where the intraocular
pressures were noted as 41 in the right eye and 45 in the left eye. At this visit, it was noted that
Patient A had some optic nerve damage and a diagnosis of pseudo-exfoliation glaucoma.

COUNTI
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation

11. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

12. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

13. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

14. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s elevated
intraocular pressure of which Respondent was aware on July 31, 2017. Respondent should have

timely consulted with a glaucoma specialist to address the elevated intraocular pressure, and such

a timely consultation may have enhanced the quality of medical care by addressing the chance that

Patient A would develop glaucoma.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

l. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against her and give
her notice that she may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4, That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and

6. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these
premises.
