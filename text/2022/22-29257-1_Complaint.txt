COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Jan J. Cumings J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Kofi Ebenezer Sarfo, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 11205). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on November 3, 2004. Respondent’s specialties are listed as
Internal Medicine and Family Practice on the Board’s website.

PATIENT A

2. On February 8, 2016, Patient A? presented to Respondent for medical care.
Respondent documented shoulder and hand pain in addition to multiple other diagnoses in
Patient A’s chief complaint section of the medical record. Respondent documented tenderness upon

palpation for Patient A’s shoulder pain but did not include any specific details to substantiate a

1 The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Aury Nagy, M.D., and
Michael C. Edwards, M.D.

* Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect their privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient

diagnosis. Respondent failed to perform or document any examination for Patient A’s hand pain.
Additionally, he ordered four (4) corticosteroid injections but failed to document a treatment plan or
provide an indication for the injections. Respondent failed to document a rationale for treatment,
procedure orders and tests, or a treatment plan to address multiple medical conditions which
Respondent listed in Patient A’s chief complaint.

3. On October 6, 2016, Patient A again presented to Respondent for medical care.
Respondent documented bilateral carpel tunnel syndrome and shoulder pain in addition to multiple
other diagnoses in Patient A’s medical record, specifically in the “chief complaint” section of the
Patient A’s medical record. Respondent simply documented that Patient A suffered from
“intractable shoulder and wrist joint pain.” Respondent billed Patient A for four (4) injections
during this visit, however, did not provide any documentation or provide any examination or studies
to support a diagnosis of carpel tunnel syndrome. Again, Respondent did not document a rationale
for treatment, medical procedure orders, or a plan to address multiple medical conditions which the
Respondent listed in Patient A’s “chief complaint” section of his medical record.

4, Respondent documented identical patient histories, review of present symptoms,
assessments, and physical examinations for Patient A on: September 17, 2014, October 1, 2014,
November 13, 2014, December 15, 2014, January 22, 2015, and January 4, 2016. Respondent’s
notes occur over a span of a sixteen (16) month period, and show exact duplication from previous
entries (e.g., cloning of entries).

5. Similarly, the “history of present illness” sections on the visits of January 6, 2014,
February 4, 2014, and March 17, 2014, are identical. Each note states that Patient A’s “chest pain
has been present for 6 days.” Such documentation demonstrates an impossibility and therefore an
inaccuracy regarding the statement “for 6 days” of Patient A’s chest pain.

6. Similarly, Respondent’s medical records for the following dates: May 28, 2014,
July 17, 2014, August 5, 2014, August 19, 2014, and September 2, 2014, all have an identical
“history of present illness” statement on the medical records. As with the prior records, Respondent
notes on each of these visits, “dyspnea present for 6 days.” Virtually, all of Patient A’s medical

records for the dates are alarmingly repetitive, providing only minimal variables such as vital signs
and the various orders issued by Respondent, and are missing procedural notes and plans.

7. Respondent’s medical billing records and billing codes for Patient A are similarly
inconsistent. On October 30, 2014, Respondent saw Patient A for the medical condition of bilateral
carpal tunnel syndrome, at which time he documented that he administered two (2) injections.
Respondent billed under Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 20615, which is for an
“aspiration and injection for treatment of bone cyst,” according to the AMA Current Procedural
Terminology (2015). The proper code is CPT 20550 for carpal tunnel injections. Respondent does
not document in Patient A’s medical record any indications or studies to support a diagnosis of a
bone cyst. The proper medical setting for the utilization of CPT code 20615 and performance of a
bone cyst aspiration or injection would be in an operating room, under a general anesthetic, and
utilizing imaging guidance. Given the foregoing, it appears Respondent used an inappropriate CPT
code for Patient A’s bilateral carpal tunnel treatment injections.

PATIENT B

8. On January 23, 2015, Patient B® presented to Respondent, with a complaint of
“intractable back pain.” Respondent documented in Patient B’s procedural note “known arthritis to
the affected joint,” but failed to specify which joint, or any anatomical details. Respondent indicated
that he performed a “arthrocentesis of lumbar sacral joints.” However, arthrocentesis of a lumbar
sacral joint is not a procedure defined in medical literature. The procedural note lacks any detail
about the indication for the procedure, fails to include any anatomical details about the patient, or
specify what was injected, and in what quantity.

9, For the January 23, 2015, procedure, Respondent billed utilizing the code CPT
62311, which is for an epidural, or subarachnoid injection, and not for arthrocentesis. An epidural
or subarachnoid injection is not a procedure typically performed at an outpatient family practice. In
addition to billing for an epidural or subarachnoid injection, Respondent billed utilizing the code

CPT 20615, which is for an “aspiration and injection for treatment of bone cyst,” according to the

3 Patient B’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect their privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation, which was served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint and filed under seal.

AMA Current Procedural Terminology (2015). Respondent failed to document any evaluation or
diagnosis of a bone cyst, or a procedure of an aspiration nor injection of a bone cyst.

10. On March 2, 2015, Respondent documented that he injected both Decadron and
Depo-Medrol into Patient B. Respondent noted left shoulder arthrocentesis as the reason for the
injections, however there was no corresponding order for the Decadron noted in Patient B’s medical
records, the only corresponding order was for Depo-Medrol. Moreover, it is unclear from Patient
B’s medical records whether he received two (2) corticosteroids (Decardron and Depo-Medrol) in
one (1) injection, a separate injection of each medication, or whether only one (1) of the
corticosteroids were injected by Respondent.

11. From January 23, 2015, through December 5, 2016, Respondent rendered medical
care and services to Patient B. At each encounter Respondent documented his treatments and billed
for his services using code “CPT 62311.” CPT Code 62311 is for an epidural or a subarachnoid
injection, not for arthrocentesis, and was billed in conjunction with multiple other back injection
codes at each visit. An epidural or subarachnoid injection is not typically performed at an outpatient
family practice setting such as the Respondent’s office. The Respondent’s note of “arthrocentesis of
lumbar sacral joints” and the billed CPT code of 62311 for an epidural or subarachnoid injection do
not match.

12. From January 23, 2015, through December 5, 2016, Respondent billed Patient B for
the CPT code 20615 multiple times. CPT Code 20615 is used for an aspiration of or injection to a
bone cyst, which is typically performed in an operating room under general anesthesia utilizing
imaging guidance. Respondent does not include any documentation or examination which supports
the diagnosis of a bone cyst or treatment of a bone cyst in Patient B.

15. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

16. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he provided medical services to Patients A and B, by failing to reasonably treat the
aforementioned patients when he performed multiple injections and other treatments without an
accurate and documented medical analysis, a justification for the treatment rendered nor
documentation of a medical justification for the treatment rendered. Respondent continuously
failed to use reasonable care and skill ordinarily used when treating Patient A and B, because of
his incomplete and inaccurate documentation utilizing inaccurate billing codes for the medical
care he provided to Patients A and B.

17. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNTS III-IV

NRS 630.3062(1)(a) Failure to Maintain Proper Medical Records

18. All the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

19. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

20. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A and B by failing to correctly and completely document his actions
when treating these patients, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate nor
complete.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNTS V-VI

NRS 630.305(1)(d) Charging for Services Not Rendered

22. ~All the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

23. NRS 630.305(1)(d) provides that the charging for visits to the physician’s office
which did not occur or for services which were not rendered or documented in the records of the
patient constitutes grounds for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

24. Respondent charged Patient A and B for services that were not rendered but were
billed according to the patients’ billing records. All the services billed under the CPT code of
20615 for Patient A were not actually performed according to his medical records, but the
Respondent billed under the code anyway and was compensated for such improper billings as a
medical provider for Patient A. All the services billed under the CPT code of 62311 for Patient B
were not actually performed, but the Respondent billed an incorrect code and was compensated
for such incorrect billings as a medical provider for Patient B.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint.

2. _That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3).

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent.

4, That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400.

5. That the Board make, issue, and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,

conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
