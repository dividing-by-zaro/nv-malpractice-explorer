unsuccessful and failed to properly remove the guidewire utilized in the Angio-Seal placement.
Patient A was discharged with the guidewire still in his left subclavian artery.

guidewire in Patient A’s subclavian artery.

7. On October 13, 2015, CT imaging showed the retained guidewire was within
Patient A’s aorta extending to the right inguinal region, The measurements were consistent with
the 70 cm wire supplied with the Angio-Seal device utilized in the June 17, 2005, procedure
performed by the Respondent.

8. As the interventional cardiologist who performed the procedure, it was
Respondent’s duty to provide supervision and oversight of the procedures performed by the
cardiovascular technician during the placement of the Angio-Seal device. Respondent therefore
failed to ensure the guidewire was removed following the Angio-Seal device insertion.
