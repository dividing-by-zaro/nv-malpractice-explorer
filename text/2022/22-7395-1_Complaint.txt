COMPLAINT nn a

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Ian J. Cumings, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that George Daisuke Momii, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

lL. Respondent was always relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 6447). Respondent was originally

licensed by the Board on March 21, 1992.

2. Patient A? was a 58-year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. Patient A had a history of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma for which she was last treated
in 2016.

4, Patent A underwent a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with Nondiagnostic

CT imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).
/T/

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Victor M. Muro, M.D., Aury Nagy, M.D., and

Ms. Maggie Arias-Petrel.
2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient

Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. On July 24, 2019, Respondent interpreted the PET/CT imaging of Patient A.
Respondent’s impression of the PET/CT was “Negative...Findings concordant with the most
recent Patient A CT...No FDG avid disease.” Additionally, Respondent documented “no new or
additional pertinent CT findings when compared with the recent CT scan of 2/4/2019.”

6. The July 24, 2019, PET/CT demonstrated Patient A had abnormal breast readings.
The scan demonstrated an asymmetric FDG avid focus of activity in Patient A’s left breast. The
presence of a focal incidental breast uptake (FIBU) on Patient A’s PET/CT, which is present in
approximately .36% to as high as 1% of PET/CT studies, is associated with a significant rate of
malignant cancer.

7. On January 3, 2020, Patient A had another PET/CT, which indicated the following
impressions: 1) 15 x 13 mm mass in the inner left breast containing a biopsy clip consistent with
Patient A’s known biopsy-proven left breast cancer; 2) a 13 mm mildly hypermetabolic sclerotic
lesion in the right iliac bone, highly suspicious for osseous metastatic disease; and 3) several sub
centimeter pulmonary nodules in the left lung as detailed above are indeterminant.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

9. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

10. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

11. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent
committed malpractice with respect to the treatment of Patient A by missing the FDG avid focus
and failing to identify the mass in Patient A’s left breast.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
