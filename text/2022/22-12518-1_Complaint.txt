cough with phlegm and prescribed Flonase, azithromycin, and Phenergan with codeine (240 ml)
with a diagnosis of bronchitis. Respondent’s notes were handwritten and largely illegible.

4, On February 3, 2020, Patient A returned again with complaints of a cough.
Respondent recorded minimal history of Patient A in his medical records, noting that Patient A
“looked healthy.” Respondent refilled the prescriptions for Phenergan with codeine (240 ml) and
Azithromycin.

5. On February 26, 2020, Patient A once again presented to Respondent with
complaints of a cough. Respondent once again did not indicate in the medical record Patient A’s
vital signs and temperature and had notes that were handwritten and largely illegible. Respondent
noted that Patient A was looking healthy with a clear chest. Respondent again refilled Patient A’s
prescriptions for Phenergan with codeine (240 ml), Azithromycin and Flonase.

6. On March 18, 2020, Patient A once again presented to Respondent with complaints
of a cough. Respondent once again did not indicate in the medical record Patient A’s vital signs
and temperature and had notes that were handwritten and largely illegible. Respondent again
refilled Patient A’s prescriptions for Phenergan with codeine (240 ml), Azithromycin and Flonase.

7. Patient A was seen four (4) times over a two (2) month period in which Respondent
treated him with a total of 960 ml of Phenergan with codeine without having ordered a chest film,
performed a sinus evaluation, or performed a physical examination. Respondent did not prescribe
any inhalers yet prescribed a mucous decongestant in the form of cough syrup with an opioid
(codeine). Respondent did not indicate within Patient A’s medical records the medical analysis
and validation for prescribing the opioid cough suppressant (Phenergan with codeine (240 ml)
once, much less refilling the prescription three (3) more times. Further, Respondent did not
document any questions presented to Patient A of risk for habitual behavior or request any
information on his family history of addiction. Moreover, there was no indication a Prescription
Monitoring Program report (PMP Report) was ordered from the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy
for Patient A, so that Respondent was aware of this patient’s prescription history or current
medication taken.

circumstances.”

11. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when

family and social histories, and failed to refer Patient A for any testing before writing a
prescription for an opioid cough suppressant (Phenergan with codeine (240 ml)) on three (3)
separate encounters, which is not using reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under
similar circumstances, violating NRS 630.301(4) malpractice.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

14. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

during any of the four (4) encounters he had with Patient A. Completion of these evaluations
should occur concurrently with the decision of whether to prescribe the opioid medication or not,
according to the Model Policy.

22. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent wrote
prescriptions to Patient A for cough syrup with opioid analgesics (cough suppressant Phenergan
with codeine 240 ml) to treat Patient A’s medical symptom of coughing with phlegm in a manner
that deviated from the Model Policy. Respondent failed to provide a medical analysis and
validation for the prescriptions provided to Patient A based on records with no medical history and
no questions presented to Patient A of risk for habitual behavior nor questions related to a family
history of addiction.

23. Respondent did not request a PMP report from the Nevada State Board of
Pharmacy before issuing prescriptions for controlled substances to Patient A. There is no

use and/or abuse of alcohol, drugs, and/or smoking, the patient’s health maintenance, an
immunization history, nor a menstrual history. Respondent noted that Patient B had a cough with
nasal congestion based upon his limited physical examination of her chest only. Respondent

with no obvious discomfort, but prescribed Phenergan with codeine (240 ml), Augmentin 875 mg
and Flonase.

28. On March 18, 2020, Patient B had her third encounter with Respondent. She
complained to Respondent about having nasal congestion and difficulty sleeping. Respondent did
not record any vital signs or obtain a chest x-ray for Patient B at this encounter. Respondent again
noted that Patient B was healthy looking and diagnosed Patient B with bronchitis. Respondent

PATIENT C

45. Patient C* was a 29 -year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

46. On November 4, 2019, Patient C presented to Respondent to establish care with a
new provider for his medications, which are listed as Oxycodone, Alprazolam, Adderall,
Chlorthalidone, Lisinopril, and Tizanidine. Patient C also had complaints of a cough. Respondent
did not review Patient C’s medical records from his previous prescribing physicians nor was a
PMP report a part of the patient’s medical records. Respondent did complete a PMH form, which
indicated Patient C had a history of a herniated vertebral disc, chronic lower lumbar pain,
hypertension, and depression; the family history of Patient C was taken and indicated depression
in his family. Patient C indicated his depression scale was a one (1); trouble falling asleep was a
three (3); and trouble concentrating was a two (2). Patient C also complained of having little
energy, being tired, and feeling depressed. Patient C’s social history was also taken indicating no
habitual behaviors. Patient C saw Respondent five (5) more times from December 4, 2019
through May 5, 2020, in which Respondent indicated in the medical records that Patient C was
healthy with no obvious distress and all medications were prescribed. There was no physical or
diagnostic examination of Patient C’s spine and no neurological and mental assessment by the
Respondent. Respondent did not order blood tests or drug testing by a laboratory to monitor
Patient C’s compliance with his medication regimen.

47. Summary of Patient C’s treatment from Respondent indicates that the medications
Adderall (amphetamine sulfate) and alprazolam (Xanax) were prescribed without Respondent
reviewing any prior medical records from the previous medical provider and no medical analysis
for their continued use by Patient C, despite the patient stating high blood pressure. The only
justification provided for the medications are very simple notes of ADHD and anxiety. There is
no indication if the patient had taken the medications before, if the risks and benefits were
discussed with the patient, nor was there any elaboration on the patient’s description of their
symptoms for these two (2) diagnoses.


4 Patient C’s identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy but is disclosed in the Patient Designation
served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

the diagnosis of anxiety or ADHD. Respondent did not perform an adequate physical examination
and there was not an adequate mental status evaluation in the medical record. No laboratory blood
or urine tests were ordered and there was no medical analysis or justification for the treatment
plan of Patient C’s depression, herniated disk, or ADHD. Additionally, there were no indications
