1306.04.

4. On or about August 10, 2020, at Western, Respondent did knowingly and
intentionally distribute a Schedule II controlled substance, Oxycodone, without a legitimate
medical purpose and outside the usual course of professional practice, in violation of Title 21,
United States Code, Sections 841(a)(1), (b)(I)(C), and Code of Federal Regulations, Section
1306.04.

5. On or about June 2, 2022, in the United States District Court, District of Nevada, in
Case No. 2:22-cr-00101-APG-VCF-1, entitled “U.S.A. v. Gary Manley” (hereinafter, the “Federal
Case”) Respondent pled guilty to a two-count Criminal Information, which charged Respondent
with two (2) counts of Distribution of a Controlled Substance (Oxycodone), in violation of 21
U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (Counts One and Two).

6. Pursuant to a Plea Agreement, under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(A) and (B), which
was filed on or about June 2, 2022 (hereinafter, the “Plea Agreement”), a true and correct copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and incorporated herein by this reference, and an
Arraignment & Plea proceeding held in the Federal Case, Respondent knowingly and voluntarily
pleaded guilty to two (2) counts of Distribution of a Controlled Substance, in violation of 21 USC
841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C), respectively, as alleged in Counts One and Two of the Criminal
Information filed in the Federal Case the same day.

7. Pursuant to 18 USC 3559(a)(3), violation of 21 USC 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C), as
alleged in Counts One and Two of the Criminal Information and as admitted to by Respondent in
the Plea Agreement filed in the Federal Case, constitute Class C felonies.

8. Pursuant to the Plea Agreement, Respondent admitted and declared under penalty
of perjury that the facts set forth below are true and correct:

a. On September 19, 2019, a confidential human source (“CHS-1”), conducted
a consensually monitored and recorded appointment with Respondent, who was then acting within
the course of his employment at Western. A female employee met CHS-I and took he/she to an

exam room. She told him/her that Western was a cash-only clinic and that the first visit would

cost five hundred dollars ($500.00) and that follow up visits thereafter would cost three hundred
dollars ($300.00).

b. After some time, Respondent entered the exam room. CHS-I complained of
pain in the right knee and described the pain as being an 8 out of 10 on the pain scale, as
previously instructed by agents. CHS-I also stated that they had previously received pain
medication from another doctor in Las Vegas, and “Roxy 30s” (that is, Oxycodone 30 mg) in
California. CHS-I gave Manley an x-ray of a generic right knee that the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigations (FBI) provided to CHS-I prior to the consultation. The x-ray showed no obvious
indicators of degeneration or damage, only normal wear for a person of CHS-I’s age and gender.

c. Despite the x-ray not supporting CHS-I’s complaint of knee pain,
Respondent briefly touched CHS-I’s knee and told CHS-I that they needed to obtain a magnetic
resonance imaging (“MRI”) scan to support the x-ray. Respondent then said, in sum and in
substance, ‘I’m bound by the law here ... supposedly to keep you from becoming an addict ...only
6% of us are susceptible,” and so the “other 94% of us have to put up with crap.”

d. CHS-I was thereafter prescribed fifty-six (56) tablets of
Oxycodone/Acetaminophen 10/325mg, a Schedule II controlled substance. FBI agents
subsequently confirmed that this prescription was electronically requested under Respondent’s
license issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).

e. On August 10, 2020, CHS-I conducted another consensually monitored and
recorded appointment with Respondent, who was then acting within the course of his employment
at Western. Upon CHS-I’s arrival on August 10, 2020, CHS-I was taken to an exam room. A
female employee asked about CHS-I’s pain. CHS-I said he/she needed more medication, as they
had run out pretty quickly the previous month. CHS-I’s estimated their pain at an 8 or 9 out of 10,
but said that the (opioid) medication helped. The employee noted that CHS-I was not
experiencing any side effects and took their weight and blood pressure. Respondent then entered
the exam room and said that he was working alone that day. After asking CHS-I a question about
ibuprofen, Respondent worked on the computer and had little further interaction with CHS-I.

Moreover, although Respondent had previously told CHS-I during a prior consultation that he

Nevada State Board

needed to put an MRI in CHS-I’s medical file because it was required by law, Respondent made
no mention of any MRI at the August 10, 2020, visit and carried out no physical exam of CHS-I.

f. CHS-I was thereafter prescribed one hundred twenty (120) tablets of
Oxycodone 15mg, a Schedule II controlled substance. FBI agents subsequently confirmed that
this prescription was electronically requested under Respondent’s DEA license.

g. Respondent knowingly distributed Oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled
substance, on September 19, 2019, and August 10, 2020, outside the usual course of professional
practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose, each in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(I),
(b)(C).

9. Pursuant to the Plea Agreement, Respondent also admitted that he is, in fact and
under the law, guilty of the crimes charged, and acknowledged that if he elected to go to trial
instead of pleading guilty, the United States could prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
Respondent further acknowledged that his admissions and declarations of fact set forth in the Plea
Agreement satisfied every element of the charged offenses.

5. Parole Abolished: Defendant acknowledges that defendant's prison sentence

cannot be shortened by early release on parole because parole has been abolished.



Case 2:22-cr-00101-APG-VCF Document7 Filéd 06/02/22 Page 5 of 17

6. Supervised Release: Defendant understands that supervised release is a period of
time following imprisonment during which defendant will be subject to various restrictions and
requirements. Defendant understands that if defendant violates one or more of the conditions of
any supervised release imposed, defendant may be returned to prison for all or part of the term of
supervised release authorized by statute for the offenses that resulted in the term of supervised
release, which could result in defendant serving a total term of imprisonment greater than the
statutory maximum stated above.

7. Factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553: Defendant understands that the district court
must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) in determining defendant's sentence.
However, the statutory maximum sentence limit the district court's discretion in determining
defendant's sentence.

8. Potential Collateral Consequences of Conviction: Defendant understands that, by
pleading guilty, defendant may be giving up valuable government benefits and valuable civic
rights, such as the right to vote, the right to possess a firearm, the right to hold office, and the
right to serve on a jury. Defendant understands that once the district court accepts defendant's
guilty pleas, it will be a federal felony for defendant to possess a firearm or ammunition.
Defendant understands that the conviction in this case may also subject defendant to various
other collateral consequences, including but not limited to revocation of probation, parole, or
supervised release in another case and suspension or revocation of a professional license.
Defendant understands that unanticipated collateral consequences will not serve as grounds to
withdraw defendant's guilty pleas.

9. Potential Removal/Deportation Consequences of Conviction: Defendant
understands that, if defendant is not a United States citizen, the felony conviction in this case

may subject defendant to removal, also known as deportation, which may, under some







Case 2:22°cr-00101-APG-VCF Document? Filed06/02/22 Page 6 of 17

circumstances, be mandatory; denial of citizenship; and denial of admission to the United States
in the future. The district court cannot advise defendant fully regarding the immigration
consequences of the felony conviction in this case, but defendant's attorney has advised him
about the deportation risks of his guilty plea. Defendant understands that unexpected
immigration consequences will not serve as grounds to withdraw defendant's guilty pleas.
Y. FACTUAL BASIS

10. Defendant admits that defendant is, in fact, guilty of the offenses to which
defendant is agreeing to plead guilty. Defendant acknowledges that if defendant elected to go to
trial instead of pleading guilty, the USAO could prove defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt. Defendant further acknowledges that defendant's admissions and declarations of fact set
forth below satisfy every clement of the charged offenses. Defendant waives any potential future
claim that the facts defendant admitted below are insufficient to satisfy the elements of the
charged offenses. Defendant admits and declares under penalty of perjury that the facts set forth
below are true and correct:

a. In 2019-2020, defendant was a licensed physician's assistant (“PA”) in the
State of Nevada (Nevada Medical License PA1209, NPI #1164749693, DEA License #
MM2157647) at Western State Pain Institute (“Western”), at 3910 Pecos-McCleod Intersection,
Suite D100, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89121. Defendant began practicing pain management at
Western around January of 2019.
Count 1
vb. On September 19, 2019, a confidential human source (“CHS 1”),

conducted a consensually monitored and recorded appointment with defendant, who was then
acting within the course of his employment at Western. A female employee met CHS 1 and took

him to an exam room. She told him that Western was a cash-only clinic; that the first visit would












Case 2:22-cr-00101-APG-VCF Document? Filed 06/02/22 Page 7 of 17

cost $500; and that follow up visits would cost $300.

c. After some time, defendant entered the exam room. CHS 1 complained of
pain in the right knee and described the pain as being an 8 out of 10 on the pain scale, as
previously instructed by agents. CHS | also stated that they had previously received pain
medication from another doctor in Las Vegas, and “Roxy 30s” (that is, Oxycodone 30 mg) in
California. CHS | gave Manley an x-ray of a generic right knee that FBI provided to CHS 1
prior to the consultation. The x-ray showed no obvious indicators of degeneration or damage,
only normal wear for a person of CHS 1's age and gender.

d. Despite the x-ray not supporting CHS 1's complaint of knee pain,
defendant briefly touched CHS 1's knee and told CHS | that they needed to obtain a magnetic
resonance imaging (“MRI”) scan to support the x-ray. Defendant then said, in sum and in
substance, “I’m bound by the law here . . . supposedly to keep you from becoming an addict . . .
only 6% of us are susceptible,” and so the “other 94% of us have to put up with crap.”

e. CHS | was thereafter prescribed 56 tablets of Oxycodone/ Acetaminophen
10/325mg, a Schedule II controlled substance. FBI agents subsequently confirmed that this
prescription was electronically requested under defendant's DEA license.

Count 2

f. On August 10, 2020, CHS | conducted another consensually monitored
and recorded appointment with defendant, who was then acting within the course of his
employment at Western.’ Upon CHS 1's arrival on August 10, 2020, CHS 1 was taken to an

exam room. A female employee asked about CHS 1's pain. CHS | said he/she needed more

' Between the September 19, 2019, and the August 10, 2020 consultations, CHS 1
consulted with defendant at Western on two other occasions: November 13, 2019, and January
21, 2020, At the conclusion of the November 13, 2019, and January 21, 2020 consultations,
defendant prescribed and distributed Oxycodone to CHS | outside the usual course of
professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose.




Case 2:22-cr-00101-APG-VCF Document? Filed 06/02/22 Page 8 of 17

medication, as he/she had run out pretty quickly the previous month. CHS 1's estimated his/her
pain at an 8 or 9 out of 10, but said that the (opioid) medication helped. The employee noted
that CHS | was not experiencing any side effects and took his/her weight and blood pressure.
Defendant then entered the exam room and said that he was working alone that day. After
asking CHS | a question about ibuprofen, defendant worked on the computer and had little
further interaction with CHS 1. Moreover—although defendant had previously told CHS 1
during a prior consultation that he needed to put an MRI in CHS 1's medical file because it was
required by law—defendant made no mention of any MRI on August 10, 2020, and carried out
no physical exam of CHS 1.

g. CHS 1 was thereafter prescribed 120 tablets of Oxycodone 15mg, a
Schedule II controlled substance. FBI agents subsequently confirmed that this prescription was
electronically requested under defendant's DEA license.

Conclusion

h. Defendant admits that: (i) he knowingly prescribed and distributed
Oxycodone, a schedule IJ controlled substance, on September 19, 2019, and August 10, 2020; (ii)
he knew that it was Oxycodone, or some other federally controlled substance; and (iii) he
distributed Oxycodone on September 19, 2019, and August 10, 2020 outside the usual course of
professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§

841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C).

i. All of the foregoing events occurred in the State and Federal District of

Nevada.

VI. SENTENCING FACTORS
11. Discretionary Nature of Sentencing Guidelines: Defendant understands that in

determining defendant's sentence, the district court is required to calculate the applicable




Case 2:22-cr-00101-APG-VCF Document7 Filed 06/02/22 Page 9 of 17

sentencing guidelines range and to consider that range, possible departures under the sentencing
guidelines, and the other sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Defendant
understands that the sentencing guidelines are advisory only, that defendant cannot have any
expectation of receiving a sentence within the calculated sentencing guidelines range, and that
after considering the sentencing guidelines and the other § 3553(a) factors, the district court will
be free to exercise its discretion to impose any sentence it finds appropriate.

12. Offense Level Calculations: The parties jointly agree and stipulate that, in
calculating defendant's advisory guidelines sentencing range, the Court should use the following
base offense level and adjustments; acknowledge that these stipulations do not bind the district
court; and agree that they will not seek to apply or advocate for the use of any other base offense
levels or any other specific offense characteristics, enhancements, or reductions in calculating the
advisory guidelines range:

Base Offense Level (USSG § 2D1.1(c)(13)}: 14

Adjusted Offense Level: 14

13. Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility: Under USSG § 3E1.1(a), the USAO
will recommend that defendant receive a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of
responsibility unless defendant (a) fails to truthfully admit facts establishing a factual basis for the
guilty pleas when defendant enters the pleas; (b) provides false or misleading information to the

USAO, the Court, Pretrial Services, or the Probation Office; (c) denies involvement in the

? The Base Offense Level is based on the following:

Count 1: 56 tablets of 10 mg Oxycodone = 560 mg or 0.56 grams. 0.56 x 6,700 (USSG
§ 2D1.1(8)(D)) = 3,752 grams, or 3.75 KG of Converted Drug Weight.

Count 2: 120 tablets of 15 mg Oxycodone = 1,800 mg or 1.8 grams. 1.8 x 6,700 = 12,060 grams,
or 12.06 KG of Converted Drug Weight.

Adding the two counts (3.75 and 12,06 KG) yields a total of 15.81 KG of Converted Drug
Weight. Under USSG § 2D].1(c)(13), Base Offense Level 14 applies to “at least 10 KG but less
than 20 KG of Converted Drug Weight.”






Case 2:22-cr-00101-APG-VCF Document7 Filed 06/02/22 Page 10 of 17

offenses or provides conflicting statements regarding defendant's involvement or falsely denies or
frivolously contests conduct relevant to the offenses; (d) attempts to withdraw any of defendant's
guilty pleas; (e) commits or attempts to commit any crime; (f) fails to appear in court; or (g)
violates the conditions of pretrial release.

Under USSG § 3E1.1(b), if the district court determines that defendant’s total offense
level before operation of § 3E1.1(a) is 16 or higher, and if the USAO recommends a two-level
downward adjustment pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the USAO will move for an
additional one-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility before sentencing
because defendant communicated defendant’s decision to plead guilty in a timely manner that
enabled the USAO to avoid preparing for trial and to efficiently allocate its resources.

14. Criminal History Category. Defendant acknowledges that the district court may
base defendant's sentence in part on defendant’s criminal record or criminal history. The district
court will determine defendant's criminal history category under the sentencing guidelines.

15. Additional Sentencing Information: The stipulated sentencing guidelines
calculations are based on information now known to the parties. Defendant understands that
both defendant and the USAO are free to (a) supplement the facts in this agreement by supplying
relevant information to the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services Offices and the district court
regarding the nature, scope, and extent of defendant's criminal conduct and any aggravating or
mitigating facts or circumstances; and (b) correct any and all factual misstatements relating to the
district court's sentencing guidelines calculations and determination of sentence. While this
paragraph permits both the USAO and defendant to submit full and complete factual
information to the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services Offices and the district court, even if that
factual information may be viewed as inconsistent with the facts agreed to in this agreement, this

paragraph does not affect defendant's and the USAO's obligations not to contest the facts agreed




Case 2:22-cr-00101-APG-VCF Document7 Filed 06/02/22 Page 11 of 17

to in this agreement. Good faith efforts to provide truthful information or to correct factual
misstatements shall not be grounds for defendant to withdraw defendant's guilty pleas.

Defendant acknowledges that the U.S. Probation Office may calculate the sentencing

Defendant also acknowledges that the district court may rely on this and other additional
information as it calculates the sentencing guidelines range and makes other sentencing
determinations, and the district court's reliance on such information shall not be grounds for
defendant to withdraw defendant's guilty pleas.

VI, POSITIONS REGARDING SENTENCING

16. | The USAO will recommend that the district court sentence defendant at the low
end of the advisory guideline range as determined by the district court, and will recommend
that the sentences on each count run concurrently to each other. Defendant may argue for a
downward variance pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), and may argue for a non-custodial
sentence.

17. Defendant acknowledges that the district court does not have to follow the
recommendation of either party.

18. Notwithstanding its agreement to recommend a sentence as described above, the
USAO reserves its right to defend any lawfully imposed sentence on appeal or in any post-
conviction litigation.

19. If defendant commits any act that results in the Court finding that defendant is
not entitled to a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the USAO is entitled to
argue for any sentence it deems appropriate under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In any such event,
Defendant remains bound by the provisions of this agreement and shall not have the right to

withdraw defendant's guilty pleas.

guidelines differently and may rely on additional information it obtains through its investigation.



Case 2:22-cr-00101-APG-VCF Document7 Filed 06/02/22 Page 12 of 17

VIII. WAIVER OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS
20. Defendant understands that by pleading guilty, defendant gives up the following
rights:

a. The right to persist in a plea of not guilty;

b. The right to a speedy and public trial by jury;

c. The right to be represented by counsel—and if necessary have the court
appoint counsel—at trial. Defendant understands, however, that, defendant retains the right to
be represented by counsel—and if necessary have the court appoint counsel—at every other stage
of the proceeding;

d. The right to be presumed innocent and to have the burden of proof placed
on the USAO to prove defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt;

e. The right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against defendant;

i The right to testify and to present evidence in opposition to the charges,
including the right to compel the attendance of witnesses to testify;

8g. The right not to be compelled to testify, and, if defendant chose not to
testify or present evidence, to have that choice not be used against defendant, and

h. The right to pursue any affirmative defenses, Fourth Amendment or Fifth
Amendment claims, and any other pretrial motions that have been filed or could be filed.

IX. WAIVER OF APPELLATE RIGHTS
21. Waiver of Appellate Rights. Defendant knowingly and expressly waives: (a) the
right to appeal any sentence imposed within or below the applicable Sentencing Guideline range
as determined by the district court; (b) the right to appeal the manner in which the district court
determined that sentence on the grounds set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3742; and (c) subject solely to

the exceptions listed in the next paragraph, the right to appeal any other aspect of the conviction,





Case 2:22-cr-00101-APG-VCF Document 7 Filed 06/02/22 Page 13 of 17

including but not limited to the constitutionality of the statutes of conviction; and any other

aspect of the sentence.

22. Defendant reserves only the right to appeal any portion of the sentence that is an
upward departure or variance from the applicable Sentencing Guideline range as determined by
the district court.

23. Waiver of Post-Conviction Rights. Defendant also knowingly and expressly
waives all collateral challenges, including any claims under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, to defendant's
conviction, sentence, and the procedure by which the district court adjudicated guilt and
imposed sentence, except non-waivable claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.

24. Preservation of Evidence: Defendant acknowledges that the USAO and the
agencies investigating this case are not obligated or required to preserve any evidence obtained in

the investigation of this case.

X. RESULT OF WITHDRAWAL OF GUILTY PLEAS
OR VACATUR/REVERSAL/SET-ASIDE OF CONVICTIONS

25. Consequence of withdrawal of guilty pleas: Defendant agrees that if, after entering

guilty pleas pursuant to this agreement, defendant seeks to withdraw and succeeds in
withdrawing defendant's guilty pleas on any basis other than a claim and finding that entry into
this agreement was involuntary, then (a) the USAO will be relieved of all of its obligations under
this agreement, (b) should the USAO choose to pursue any charge that was either dismissed or
not filed as a result of this agreement, then (i) any applicable statute of limitations will be tolled
between the date of defendant's signing of this agreement and the filing commencing any such
action; and (ii) defendant waives and gives up all defenses based on the statute of limitations,

any claim of pre-indictment delay, or any speedy trial claim with respect to any such action,


cmt




Case 2:22-cr-00101-APG-VCF Document7 Filed 06/02/22 Page 14 of 17

except to the extent that such defenses existed as of the date of defendant's signing this

agreement.

26. Consequence of vacatur, reversal, or set-aside: Defendant agrees that if any count

of conviction is vacated, reversed, or set aside, the USAO may: (a) ask the district court to
resentence defendant on any remaining counts of conviction, with both the USAO and
defendant being released from any stipulations regarding sentencing contained in this agreement;
(b) ask the district court to void the entire plea agreement and vacate defendant's guilty pleas on
any remaining counts of conviction, with both the USAO and defendant being released from all
their obligations under this agreement; or (c) leave defendant's remaining convictions, sentence,
and plea agreement intact. Defendant agrees that the choice among these three options rests in
the exclusive discretion of the USAO, and that, should the USAO choose to pursue any charge
that was either dismissed or not filed as a result of this agreement, then (i) any applicable statute
of limitations will be tolled between the date of defendant's signing of this agreement and the
filing commencing any such action; and (ii) defendant waives and gives up all defenses based on
the statute of limitations, any claim of pre-indictment delay, or any speedy trial claim with
respect to any such action, except to the extent that such defenses existed as of the date of
defendant's signing this agreement.
XI. BREACH OF AGREEMENT

27. Defendant agrees that if, at any time after this agreement becomes effective,
defendant knowingly violates or fails to perform any of defendant's obligations under this
agreement (‘'a breach"), the USAO may declare this agreement breached. All of defendant’s
obligations are material, a single breach of this agreement is sufficient for the USAO to declare a
breach, and defendant shall not be deemed to have cured a breach without the express agreement

of the USAO in writing. If the USAO declares this agreement breached, and the district court






Case 2:22-cr-00101-APG-VCF Document? Filed 06/02/22 Page 15 of 17

finds such a breach to have occurred, then: (a) if defendant has previously entered guilty pleas
pursuant to this agreement, defendant will remain bound by the provisions of this agreement and
will not be able to withdraw the guilty pleas, and (b) the USAO will be relieved of all its
obligations under this agreement.
XIII. COURT AND UNITED STATES PROBATION
AND PRETRIAL SERVICES OFFICE NOT PARTIES.

28. Defendant understands that the Court and the U.S. Probation and Pretrial
Services Office are not parties to this agreement and need not accept any of the USAO's
sentencing recommendations or the parties' agreements to facts or sentencing factors.

29. Defendant understands that both defendant and the USAO are free to argue on
appeal and collateral review that the district court’s sentencing guidelines calculations and the
sentence it chooses to impose are not error.

30. | Defendant understands that even if the district court ignores any sentencing
recommendation, finds facts or reaches conclusions different from those agreed to by the parties,
or imposes any sentence up to the maximum established by statute, defendant cannot, for that
reason, withdraw defendant’s guilty pleas, and defendant will remain bound to fulfill all
defendant's obligations under this agreement. Defendant understands that no one—not the
prosecutor, defendant's attorney, or the Court—can make a binding prediction or promise
regarding the sentence defendant will reccive, except that it will be within the statutory
maximum.
