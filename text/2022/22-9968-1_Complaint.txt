without limitation, (a) the application of electricity for the sole purpose of contracting a muscle, (b) the application of
a topical lotion, cream or other substance which affects anything other than the uppermost layers of the skin, (c) the
penetration of the skin by needles, and (d) the abrasion of the skin below the uppermost layers of the skin.
