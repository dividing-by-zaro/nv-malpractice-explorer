fatigue and had recently finished treatment for bronchitis. After a normal physical exam,
Respondent ordered testing for Lyme disease.

4, On September 17, 2017, Patient A returned to Respondent with complaints of flu-
like symptoms after overseas travel, however her physical exam was normal. Respondent ordered
tests for Lyme disease a second time, and recommended supplements for an encompassing
treatment for chronic yeast and viral overload.

5. On October 5, 2017, Respondent informed Patient A that she tested positive for
Lyme disease and reported the case as positive to the Nevada Department of Health, despite
negative test results for Lyme disease. Respondent did not treat for Lyme disease, but instead
recommend further courses of supplements and a detox.

6. Patient A had follow-up visits for her Lyme disease diagnosis on January 11, 2018;
April 12, 2018; and June 7, 2018. On each visit, Respondent documented a normal review of
symptoms and physical examination, recommending additional supplements on each occasion.

7. On July 23, 2018, Patient A had a follow-up visit with complaints of diarrhea
caused by the supplements that were recommended to her by Respondent. At this visit
Respondent recommended continued supplementation and started Patient A on Ivermectin, an
antiparasitic drug usually given in a single dose. Patient A was given a 12-milligram weekly dose
of Ivermectin for one (1) month. No stool studies or parasitology tests were ordered on this visit.

8. Patient A was further seen by Respondent four (4) times over a five (5) month
period in 2018 and 2019, during which, Respondent refilled a prescription for Ivermectin for five
(5) months without ordering stool studies or parasitology tests. Respondent continued to
recommend additional supplements on each visit to treat Lyme disease when the standard of care
for treatment is a course of antibiotics.

B. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient B

9. Patient B was a 54-year-old male when he presented to Respondent on
December 21, 2017, for medical care. Patient B had complaints of weight gain, problems with
sinuses, and fatigue. Patient B did not report a history of tick bites, nor did he live in an area

endemic with ticks. Review of symptoms and physical examination were normal, and no

abnormalities were documented by the Respondent on the physical examination. Respondent
ordered blood and stool tests in addition to a Lyme disease test, diagnosing Patient B with fatigue,
anxiety, adrenal disorder, sleep apnea, and headaches. Respondent recommended a
comprehensive “detox and drain” in addition to a number of other supplements.

10. On January 23, 2018, Patient B was informed by Respondent that he had Lyme
disease, Babesia, Ehrlichiosis, Rickettsia Rickettsiae, and Rickettsia Typhi, despite negative test
results. Stool studies were similarly negative for parasites, including ova and EIA (enzyme
immunoassays) for parasites.

11. Despite clear negative testing, Respondent documented that testing demonstrated
evidence to treat Patient B for Lyme disease and its co-infections. Respondent did not prescribe
antibiotics, but recommended supplements.

12. Patient B was seen by Respondent on a further seven (7) occasions during 2018
and 2019, during which Respondent maintained her diagnosis of Patient B as having Lyme disease
and its coinfections, despite further clear negative testing on April 22, 2019, and repeated normal
physical examinations. Respondent reported Patient B’s tests as a positive case of Lyme to the
Nevada Department of Health on May 3, 2019. During all seven (7) visits, Respondent continued
to recommend additional supplements on each visit to treat Lyme disease when the standard of
care for treatment is a course of antibiotics.

C. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient C

13. Patient C was a 45-year-old female when she presented to Respondent on
February 28, 2018, for medical care. No complaints were documented by the Respondent. Patient
C did not report a history of tick bites, nor did she live in an area endemic with ticks. Patient C’s
review of symptoms and physical examination were normal. Respondent ordered multiple blood

and stool tests, diagnosing Patient C with Candidiasis, and “other fatigue,” recommending a

“detox and drain” and supplements.
14. Despite Patient C testing negative for Lyme disease, Respondent reported Patient C
as a positive case of Lyme disease case to the Nevada Department of Health on March 15, 2018.

Subsequently, on March 19, 2018, Respondent notified Patient C that she had Lyme disease.

15. On April 16, 2018, Patient C was seen for a follow-up appointment to review her
lab results. No complaints were reported, and the review of symptoms and physical examination
were documented as normal. All stool studies were negative for parasites, ova, and EIA for
parasites. Respondent recommended further supplements.

16. Patient C was seen five (5) times over a twelve (12) month period in which
Respondent prescribed her with Ivermectin and Praziquantel to treat parasitic infections, despite
clear testing on April 16, 2018, showing Patient C was negative for parasites. Respondent
continued to maintain a diagnosis of Lyme disease and ordered repeated testing for Lyme disease
despite previous negative testing. Furthermore, Respondent at every visit recommend treatment
for Lyme disease and its coinfections with supplements, and detox and drains without a clinical
basis to do so when the standard of care for treatment of Lyme disease is a course of antibiotics.

prescribing potentially toxic medications in the treatment of parasitic infections in an
inappropriate manner with an inappropriate dose and duration.
