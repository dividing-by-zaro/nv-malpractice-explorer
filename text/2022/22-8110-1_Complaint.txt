The Investigative Committee (IC)! of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

3; Patient A presented to Respondent with marked stiffness, weakness, and pain with
motion in her left shoulder. Respondent diagnosed Patient A with a chronic large rotator cuff tear,
and advanced degenerative joint disease of the left shoulder.

4. On July 2, 2015, Respondent performed a preoperative history and physical for
Patient A. Respondent documented a normal neurologic examination with sensation grossly intact
in all dermatomes, and intact motor function in all groups. Respondent discussed treatment
options and risks of surgery with Patient A, who elected to undergo a left reverse total shoulder
arthroplasty. Respondent scheduled Patient A for surgery on July 6, 2015.

5: On July 6, 2015, Respondent performed a left reverse total shoulder arthroplasty
(Operation 1), on Patient A. During Operation 1, the left axillary artery was damaged. A vascular
surgeon was called in intraoperatively to repair the artery. The vascular surgeon attempted to
close the damaged artery with a mattress suture but the vessel tore. Ultimately, a purse string
suture was utilized, and an additional two (2) ties were placed around the artery to control the
bleeding, leaving the artery occluded by suture. Respondent failed to note the tearing or
additional suturing required to close the artery in his postoperative report. Operation 1 was then
completed without further complications.

6. Respondent failed to document or obtain a postoperative physical exam of Patient
A following Operation 1 and failed to ascertain the significance of the blood vessel following the
procedure.

Ts On July 22, 2015, Respondent had the first postoperative visit with Patient A who
complained of numbness in her hand. Respondent failed to document or perform a thorough and
appropriate motor, sensory, and vascular exam of the operative extremity.

8. Patient A was seen again on August 5, 2015, and August 27, 2015, with continued
complaints and numbness in the left hand and weakness. Respondent noted Patient A had
“atypical pain.” Respondent failed to document or perform a thorough and appropriate motor,
sensory, and vascular exam of the operative extremity post-operatively and failed to workup
Patient A’s numbness and “atypical pain.”

9. On September 2, 2015, and September 24, 2015, Respondent examined Patient A
for complaints of pain in her right shoulder but did not document or reference the left shoulder at
these visits. Respondent’s notes his neurologic examination of the right shoulder “[s]ensation
grossly intact in all dermatomes, motor function intact in all groups.”

10. | On November 10, 2015, Patient A was examined by Respondent with continuing
complaints of numbness of the hand, pain, and weakness in the left extremity. Respondent failed
to document or perform a thorough and appropriate exam of the left upper extremity with no
mention of a vascular examination.

11. In November 2015, Patient A was examined by other physicians who noted her
vascular and neurologic defects. An angiography revealed the total occlusion of the left axillary
artery. Patient A ultimately underwent a second procedure, (Operation 2), to remove the
occlusion and revascularize the left upper extremity. Neurologic evaluation following Operation 2
confirmed chronic brachial plexopathy which results in pain, decreased movement, and sensation
in the arm and shoulder.

12. Patients with postoperative neurologic symptoms should be evaluated with a high
index of suspicion to avoid a delay in treatment and should be followed closely to prevent
permanent injury. Respondent documented Patient A’s continued complaints of left-hand
numbness and noted “atypical pain” but failed to workup the etiology of Patient A’s neurologic
deficits. Respondent also failed to perform or document a thorough and appropriate motor,
sensory and vascular examination of Patient A despite the vascular injury during Operation 1
which occurred close to the brachial plexus.
