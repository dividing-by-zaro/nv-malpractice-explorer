kA RE *

In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 22-31575-1
Against:
DIETRICH VON FELDMANN, M.D.,

Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Ian J. Cumings, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Dietrich Von Feldmann, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint, a physician licensed to
practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 12002). Respondent was originally licensed
by the Board on August 17, 2006.

A. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient A

2. Patient A was an 80-year-old year-old male when he presented to the Respondent for
medical care on June 20, 2018. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy,
but is disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this
Complaint.

3. Patient A presented to Respondent on June 20, 2018, for a surveillance colonoscopy

due to a personal history of colon polyps.

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Victor M. Muro, M.D., Chairman,

4, During the procedure, Respondent discovered a number of flat cecal polyps and
performed an endoscopic mucosal resection on a 1 em flat cecal polyp, in addition to a second
ascending colon polyp.

5. Patient A developed abdominal post-operative pain. Respondent informed Patient A
that there was a risk of developing post polypectomy coagulation necrosis syndrome as a result of
the procedure and that he would feel better after he passed some gas. Patient A was then
discharged.

6. Patient A’s spouse contacted Respondent on the evening of June 20, 2018, when
Patient A’s abdominal pain had worsened (to a 10/10 on the pain scale). Respondent failed to order
an immediate abdominal radiograph to rule out colon perforation, and only considered a diagnosis of
post polypectomy coagulation necrosis syndrome and prescribed oxycontin for pain.

7. Patient A continued to suffer with severe pain in his abdomen and returned to the
Emergency Room on the morning of June 21, 2018, whereupon Patient A underwent a CT scan of
the abdomen and pelvis, which showed a large amount of free air in the right upper quadrant of the
abdomen.

8. Respondent viewed Patient A’s CT scan on June 21, 2018, and failed to recognize
that the large amount of free air in Patient A’s abdomen indicated possible colon perforation which
warranted immediate surgical evaluation.

9. Patient A was transferred by air ambulance to Renown Medical Center by his
primary care provider due to the concerning findings on the CT scan, whereupon Patient A was
taken for an exploratory laparotomy, right hemicolectomy, and partial omentectomy.

10. The surgical report from Renown Medical Center showed a dilated proximal colon
of at least 10cm. There was splitting of the serosa for at least 9cm along the ascending colon and
extensive air within the pericolonic tissue consistent with a perforated colon due to iatrogenic injury.
Patient A spent eight (8) days in the hospital and was discharged on June 29, 2018.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

11. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

12. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

13. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.”

14. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances with
respect to the treatment of Patient A by failing to order an immediate abdominal radiograph to
exclude the possibility of colon perforation when Patient A complained of severe pain on June 20,
2018, after the colonoscopy that Respondent performed. Furthermore, Respondent committed
malpractice by his failure to recognize and appreciate the gravity of free air in the right upper
quadrant which suggested colon perforation and warranted immediate surgical evaluation.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
