COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Ian J. Cumings, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Tatiana Michaelovna Warner, PA-C (Respondent)
violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada
Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues
its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician assistant
licensed to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. PA987). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on April 19, 2006.

A. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient A

2. Patient A was a 51-year-old female with downs syndrome when she presented to
the Respondent for medical care on December 31, 2018. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed
herein to protect her privacy but is disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon the

3. Patient A was non-verbal with a six (6) month history of cognitive decline when
she presented to an urgent care facility on December 29, 2018, with complaints of upper
respiratory congestion, difficulty breathing and worsening respiratory symptoms.

4, Urgent care staff noted Patient A’s oxygen saturation was ninety-two percent
(92%) on room air, with a blood pressure of 91/53, and a heart rate of 95 beats per minute.

5. Patient A had a large cough, and her examination showed expiratory wheezing. A
limited chest X-ray was performed with only one (1) view, due to Patient A being wheelchair
bound, which was negative for any acute cardiopulmonary processes.

6. Patient A was discharged with a prescription for an antibiotic, a nebulizer, and
steroids, Patient A’s caregivers were given instructions to follow up as needed in an emergency
care setting and scheduled a follow-up visit on December 31, 2018, with the Respondent.

7. Respondent saw Patient A on December 31, 2018, for the scheduled follow-up
visit. Respondent noted Patient A presented as semi-conscious but arousable, and wheelchair
bound with dizziness and shortness of breath.

8. Respondent failed to either document and/or perform a neurological evaluation for
Patient A who she characterized as ‘semi-conscious’ but noted the patient as ‘normal’ on the
psychiatric component of Patient A’s chart. Respondent failed to include a cranial nerve exam, or
an exam of Patient A’s reflexes and brain stem reflexes.

9. Patient A’s condition had worsened since she was seen at the urgent care clinic two
(2) days earlier. Patient A’s oxygen saturation was noted to be critical value of sixty-seven
percent (67%) on room oxygen. The low oxygen saturation was consistent with acute hypoxemia
and respiratory failure for a patient with downs syndrome.

10. Respondent discharged Patient A with instructions to follow-up with a neurologist
for the dizziness, and a scheduled follow-up visit in two (2) months.

11. | Respondent’s discharge plan did not mention the acute respiratory issues, including
Patient A’s shortness of breath, and lacked any appropriate treatment plan to address the
hypoxemia.

12. Patient A died the following day, January 1, 2019, from acute respiratory failure.
