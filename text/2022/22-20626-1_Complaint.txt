By:

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Aaron B. Fricke, J.D., General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Robert Andrew Kilpatrick, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 11530). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 20, 2005.

2. Patient A? was a fourteen (14) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On June 9, 2014, Patient A presented to Sunrise Medical Center (Sunrise)
Emergency Department in active labor.

4. On June 10, 2014, Patient A, via spontaneous vaginal delivery, delivered a full
term eight (8) Ibs., fourteen (14) oz. baby, sustaining a second-degree vaginal tear and perineal

laceration, which were repaired by the physician who supervised the delivery.

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Aury Nagy, M.D.,

and Mr. M. Neil Duxbury.
2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect their privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient

5. On June 11, 2014, Patient A was discharged home, with a plan to follow-up in
three (3) weeks with her obstetrician.

6. Respondent is a Pediatric Emergency Physician, and was working at Sunrise on
June 15, 2014, when Patient A, who was five (5) days post-partem, presented to Sunrise
Emergency Department at 3:50 a.m. with complaints of abdominal pain, mild vaginal bleeding,
and fever at home for two (2) days.

7. Respondent examined Patient A and was appropriately concerned about and
initiated an evaluation for sepsis, among other possible diagnoses. A Complete Blood Count with
differential, and Complete Metabolic Panel were also ordered, among several other tests.

8. Patient A was a difficult and doubtful case, as she was, among other factors, post-
partem, young age at time of delivery, suffering pelvic pain, fever, hypotension with tachycardia
on evaluation, and elevation in white blood cell count with bandemia.

9. Respondent did initially consult via telephone with an obstetrician. However,
Patient A would have benefited from an in-person consultation at bedside with an obstetrician.

10. At approximately 6:00 a.m. on June 15, 2014, Respondent discharged Patient A,
with instructions to follow-up within two (2) days with her obstetrician, without first seeking an
in-person consultation at bedside with an obstetrician.

reference as though fully set forth herein.

12. Pursuant to NAC 630.185, NAC 630.185 to 630.230, inclusive, set forth the
standards of practice established by the Board.

13. Pursuant to NAC 630.210, a physician shall seek consultation with another
provider of health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may
enhance the quality of medical services.

14. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed

when rendering medical services to Patient A to seek consultation with an obstetrician at bedside

in the doubtful and difficult case presented by Patient A when it was evident that such
consultation would enhance the quality of medical services provided to Patient A.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1, That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
