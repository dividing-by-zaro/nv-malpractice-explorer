OF THE STATE OF NEVADA
In the Matter of Charges and Case No. 21-28177-2
Complaint Against: FIL ED
JOSE HIRAM ALVAREZ, M.D.,

Respondent.

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Donald K. White, J.D., Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the
IC, and Ian J. Cumings, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a reasonable
basis to believe that Jose Hiram Alvarez, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of Nevada
Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Second Amended Complaint, stating the
IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a Medical Doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10765). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on December 5, 2003. Respondent’s specialty is listed as
Obstetrics/Gynecology on the Board’s website. Cosmetic surgery is not a specialty of obstetrics
and gynecology

2. The true identities of Patient A, Patient B, Patient C, and Patient D are not disclosed
to protect their privacy but are disclosed in the Supplemental Patient Designation.

3. On August 20, 2018, Patient A presented to Respondent to perform the following

procedures: suction-assisted liposuction of the abdomen, flank, and back; abdominoplasty pannus

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Aury Nagy, M.D.,
and Mr. M. Neil Duxbury.

removal, and a fat transfer to the buttock. Respondent used tumescent anesthesia for all of the
procedures and acted as Surgeon and Anesthesiologist during Patient A’s surgery. The patient
history and physical examination portion of Patient A’s medical records lacked the standard
measurements and details typically noted in cosmetic plastic surgery evaluations.

4, On August 1, 2018, Patient B presented to Respondent to perform the following
procedures: suction-assisted liposuction of the abdomen, flank, and back; abdominoplasty pannus
removal, and a fat transfer to the buttock. Respondent used tumescent anesthesia for all of the
procedures and acted as Surgeon and Anesthesiologist for Patient B’s care. As with Patient A,
Patient B’s medical records lacked the standard measurements and details typically noted in
cosmetic plastic surgery evaluations.

5. On January 8, 2018, Patient C presented to Respondent to perform the following
procedures: suction-assisted liposuction of the abdomen, flank and back; abdominoplasty pannus
removal, and a fat transfer to the buttock. Respondent again used tumescent anesthesia for all of the
procedures and acted as surgeon and anesthesiologist for Patient C’s care. Patient C’s medical
records lacked the standard measurements and details typically noted in cosmetic plastic surgery
evaluations.

6. On July 26, 2018, Patient D presented to Respondent to perform a breast lift.
Respondent had previously performed a breast augmentation for Patient D in 2014. Patient D’s
medical records lacked the standard measurements and details typically noted in cosmetic plastic
surgery evaluations.

7. Respondent lacks the requisite training in plastic surgery to carry out surgeries such
as liposuction, breast augmentations, brachioplasties, fat transfers and abdominoplasties. Except for
liposuction, those procedures should be performed under general anesthesia with a board-certified
anesthesiologist or Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) present.

8. Respondent is not certified by a specialty board of the American Board of Medical
Specialties, as required by NRS 630.160, to perform plastic surgery. Cosmetic surgery is a
subspecialty of plastic surgery. Respondent’s training in cosmetic surgery consisted of various

workshops for which he received various certificates of completion. Performing abdominoplasties,

brachioplasties, breast augmentations, and fat transfer procedures, require these procedures to be
performed under general anesthesia with a board-certified Anesthesiologist or Certified Registered
Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) present (Emphasis added). Liposuction procedures are generally
acceptable with the use of tumescent anesthesia; however, the other procedures performed by
Respondent, at the same time as the liposuction was performed, require the use of a general
anesthesia with a board-certified Anesthesiologist or CRNA present. Neither a CRNA nor an
Anesthesiologist were present during the surgeries on Patients A, B, C or D by Respondent.
Respondent has provided no documentation regarding his training and/or experience in performing

brachioplasties, abdominoplasties or fat transfer to the buttocks prior to performing these procedures

on Patients A through D.
COUNTS I-IV
NRS 630.301(4) (Malpractice)
9. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

reference as though fully set forth herein.

10. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

11. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

12. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he provided medical services to Patients A, B, C, and D because Respondent lacked the requisite
training in plastic surgery to single-handedly perform liposuctions, breast augmentations,
brachioplasties, fat transfers, and abdominoplasties; and, because Respondent improperly used
tumescent anesthesia when performing abdominoplasties, brachioplasties, breast augmentations,
and fat transfer procedures.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

NRS 630.306(1)(e) (Practice Beyond Scope of License)

14. _ All the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

15. | NRS 630.306(1)(e) provides that practicing or offering to practice beyond the scope
permitted by law or performing services which the Licensee knows or has reason to know that he or
she is not competent to perform, or which are beyond the scope of his or her training is grounds for
initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

16. As demonstrated by, but not limited to the above-outlined facts, Respondent’s
specialty is listed as Obstetrics/Gynecology under NRS 630.160. Respondent is not a board-
certified Plastic Surgeon and has only received instruction in cosmetic surgery from workshops and
therefore lacks the requisite and proper training in plastic and cosmetic surgery to perform
liposuctions, breast augmentations, brachioplasties, fat transfers, and abdominoplasties.

17. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
COUNTS IX-XII

NRS 630.3062(1)(a) (Failure to Maintain Proper Medical Records)

reference as though fully set forth herein.

19. | NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

20. Respondent failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A, B, C and D by failing to document his actions and
noting the standard measurements and details typically noted in cosmetic plastic surgery evaluations
when he treated Patients A, B, C and D.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
