In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 22-27891-1
Against: FILED
GEORGE PETER CHAMBERS, M.D. SEP 21 2022

Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

MEDICAdp EXAMINERS
By:

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Brandee Mooneyhan, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the
IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that George Peter Chambers, M.D., (Respondent) violated
the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the
IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10476). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on April 30, 2003, and specializes in obstetrics and gynecology.

2. As noted by the Committee on Ethics of the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists (ACOG), the “relationship between obstetrician-gynecologists and their
patients . . . requires a high level of trust and professional responsibility,” because the practice of
this medical specialty “includes interactions in times of intense emotion and vulnerability for
patients and involves sensitive physical examinations and medically necessary disclosure of
private information about symptoms and experiences.” See AGOC Committee Opinion No. 796,

Sexual Misconduct (January 2020).

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Victor M. Muro, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ahsan,
MLD., Ph.D., FACC, and Ms. Pamela J. Beal.

3. Physician behavior, gestures, or expressions that are seductive, sexually suggestive,
disrespectful of patient privacy, or sexually demeaning to a patient constitute sexual impropriety,
and are a form of physician sexual misconduct. Jd.

4. In professional settings, “obstetrician-gynecologists should strictly avoid sexual
innuendo, sexually suggestive humor, and sexually provocative remarks,” and even in nonclinical

communication with current patients, should maintain professional boundaries. Jd.

PATIENT A
5. Patient A? was a thirty-six (36) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.
6. Patient A sought surgical repair of a damaged perineum, and Patient A’s regular

gynecologist referred Patient A to Respondent for consultation. Patient A presented to
Respondent’s medical office on November 17, 2020, for the desired consultation.

7. After telling Patient A to undress for a physical examination, Respondent told
Patient A to keep her personal cellular phone nearby, as he would be using it to take pictures
during the examination.

8. During the course of Patient A’s examination, Respondent used Patient A’s cellular
phone to take approximately twelve (12) photographs of Patient A’s vaginal and anal areas.

9. Among the photographs taken by Respondent on November 17, 2020, is a
photograph of him inserting four (4) fingers in Patient A’s vagina.

10. Of the approximately twelve (12) photographs he took of Patient A on
November 17, 2020, Respondent directed her to send two (2) of the photos, which showed her
vulva, to his cellular phone via text message.

11. The photograph of Respondent inserting four (4) fingers into Patient A’s vagina
was not one of the photographs he asked her to text to him.

12. Patient A was uncomfortable texting the pictures to Respondent's cellular phone, in
part because she had no assurances that the data was being exchanged securely, how the pictures
might be used, or who might have access to them once they were sent.


2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

Nonetheless, Patient A did as Respondent directed and sent the two (2) photographs via text
message to the phone number Respondent provided.

13. In his medical record of the November 17, 2020, encounter, Respondent indicated
that he inserted two (2) fingers in Patient A’s vagina, stating: “On sizing the introital opening with
my two examining fingers, the vagina opened to a width of 7cm horizontally and vertically.”

14. In his response to a request for information in the IC’s investigation of this matter,
Respondent repeated his assertion that he inserted only two (2) fingers in Patient A’s vagina
during the November 17, 2020, encounter, stating that he “inserted one finger into her vagina” in
his evaluation of her pelvic floor muscles, and “then inserted [his] two examining fingers to check
the tonicity of her pubococcygeus muscles by asking her to squeeze her vagina.”

15. Respondent did not document in the medical record, nor inform the IC during its
investigation, that during the November 17, 2020, encounter with Patient A, he inserted four (4)
fingers into her vagina.

16. After his physical examination of Patient A, Respondent informed Patient A that
during the examination, he had attempted to “fist” her, that is, insert his entire hand into her
vagina, see Artemie v. State, No. A-10463, 2011 WL 5904452, at *8 (Alaska Ct. App. Nov. 23,
2011), but had been unable to insert his entire hand, and he showed her how much of his hand he
had been able to insert.

17. Respondent also showed Patient A the two (2) photographs that she had texted him,
which he had printed following the physical examination, and used them to explain the procedures
he proposed to perform on her. Respondent included the two (2) photographs in Patient A’s
medical record.

18. After her encounter with Respondent on November 17, 2020, Patient A suffered
pain and tenderness in her genital area.

19. | The other approximately ten (10) photographs Respondent took of Patient A’s
vaginal and rectal area, which he did not direct her to send to him, were not for purposes of,
medical examination or treatment.

20.  Respondent’s action in taking numerous pictures of Patient A’s vaginal and rectal
areas that were not for purposes of medical examination or treatment, as well as using the
nonmedical term “fisting” and informing Patient A that he had attempted to do so, humiliated and
sexually demeaned Patient A.

21.  Respondent’s action in taking numerous photographs of Patient A’s vaginal and
rectal areas on an unsecured cellular telephone and directing Patient A to text some of those
photographs to him, in the absence of any assurance of how the photographs would be protected
from improper access, was disrespectful of Patient A’s privacy.

24.  Respondent’s behavior in taking approximately ten (10) photographs of Patient A’s
vaginal and rectal areas that were not for purposes of medical examination or treatment was
humiliating and sexually demeaning to Patient A and thus adversely affected the quality of care
rendered to her.

provided in NRS 630.352.

reference as though fully set forth herein.

31.  NRS 630.306(1)(b)(1) provides that “engaging in any conduct, which is intended to

32.  Respondent’s statement in the medical record of his encounter with Patient A on
November 17, 2020, that he measured Patient A’s introital opening with “two examining fingers”
and his failure to otherwise document that he had inserted four (4) fingers into Patient A’s vagina
during that encounter was calculated to conceal that he had inserted four (4) fingers into Patient
A’s vagina.

33.  Respondent’s statement in his response to the IC’s investigative inquiry that he had
inserted no more than two (2) fingers into Patient A’s vagina during the November 17, 2020,
encounter was calculated to conceal that Respondent had inserted four (4) fingers into Patient A’s
vagina.

34. By knowingly making statements designed to conceal that he had inserted four (4)
fingers into Patient A’s vagina during his November 17, 2020, encounter with her, Respondent
engaged in conduct intended to deceive the Board or any other authority examining his record of
the encounter.

35. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

for the taking of, nude photographs of the patient(s), ostensibly to use in an advertisement for his
services.

43. The nude photographs for which Respondent offered to pay Patient B or other
patients were not for purposes of medical examination or treatment.

44, Telling Patient B during a medical encounter that he would pay her or other

an advertisement. Respondent offered to pay Patient C one thousand dollars ($1,000) to

participate in such a photography session, as well as give her a thumb drive with the “boudoir”

purposes of medical examination or treatment.

55. Offering to pay Patient C one thousand dollars ($1,000) to pose for nude
