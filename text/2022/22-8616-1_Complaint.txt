restriction from his license to practice medicine. During his appearance, Respondent adamantly
assured the Board that he would keep the chaperone in place and gave the Board permission to
randomly retrieve his records to determine if he was utilizing the chaperone(s) appropriately. The
Board voted on the request by Respondent and the request was approved to remove the restriction
of having a chaperone during Respondent’s treatment of female patients. However, the Board
made clear to Respondent that it continued to have the expectation for him to have a chaperone,
but it would not be a condition on his license.

Respondent’s license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada, with the understanding he
would continue to utilize chaperones.
