COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Chad Kruger (Respondent), a licensed
Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes

Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in Nevada in active status (License No. RC214), and has
been so licensed by the Board since December 3, 2001.

B. Respondent’s Disreputable Conduct

Nevada, along with two other individuals, on charges of: Insurance Fraud Committed to Promote
Activities of a Criminal Gang, a felony; Theft Committed to Promote Activities of a Criminal
Gang, a felony; Conspiracy, a gross misdemeanor. The charges stem from Respondent’s
involvement in a conspiracy to fake the theft of a Suzuki motorcycle belonging to one of the

other defendants, and report it stolen to an insurance company to obtain an insurance settlement

! The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) was composed of Board
members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., member and M. Neil Duxbury, public

and agreed to pay restitution to various parties totaling $10,570.37.

4. On February 1, 2016, upon substantial satisfaction of the aforementioned punishment, the
indictment was amended to a single count of Conspiracy to Commit Insurance Fraud, a gross
misdemeanor, to which Respondent pled guilty, and a final judgment was rendered on April 21,
2016.

5. Accordingly, Respondent, a licensed RRT in active practice in the State of Nevada, was

6. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference as
though fully set forth herein.

pursuant to NRS 630.301(9), including, without limitation, conduct that violates any provision of
a code of ethics adopted by the Board by regulation based on a national code of ethics.

8. Respondent’s participation in a criminal conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, and a
criminal conviction for such, constitutes engaging in conduct that brings the medical profession
into disrepute.

9. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as provided
in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays that the Board:
