vehicle, and rear-ended another vehicle stopped at a red light in Los Angeles County, California.
He failed field sobriety tests, was arrested and transported to jail, where his blood alcohol content
(BAC) was tested and found to be in excess of 0.19 BAC.


| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., and Mr. M. Neil
