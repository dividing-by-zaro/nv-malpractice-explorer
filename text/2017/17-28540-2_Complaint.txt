Order is incorporated herein by this reference. Respondent has been licensed by the Board
pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice Act since December 9, 2003.

2. Pursuant to NAC 630.375(2), a physician assistant shall not perform medical
services without supervision from a supervising physician licensed and approved by the Board.

3. Pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(1), a physician assistant may not engage in any
conduct which is intended to deceive.

4, Pursuant to NRS 630.3065(2)(a), a licensee shall not knowingly or willfully fail to

comply with a subpoena or order of the Board.

5. Pursuant to NRS 630.020, the “practice of medicine” means either (1) to
diagnose, treat, correct, prevent or prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity,
deformity or other condition, physical or mental, by any means or instrumentality, including, but
not limited to, the performance of an autopsy, or (2) to apply principles or techniques of medical
science in the diagnosis or the prevention of any such conditions, or (3) to offer, undertake,
attempt to do or hold oneself out as able to do any of the acts described in (1) and (2).

6. On September 5, 2017, the Board was notified in writing by Respondent’s previous
supervising physician that such required supervision was terminated on July 1, 2017, and that
Respondent was therefore not currently supervised by a physician licensed and approved by the
Board.

7. On September 6, 2017, the Board’s Chief of Investigations, Pamela Castagnola,
personally presented to Respondent’s medical office, Modern Medical & Wellness, located at 911
N. Buffalo Drive, Suite 113, Las Vegas, NV 89128-8397, where Respondent was actively
performing medical services. Ms. Castagnola personally notified Respondent that she had no
supervising physician, and that she was prohibited, pursuant to NAC 630.375(2), from performing
medical services until there was a supervising physician for her practice that was licensed and
approved by the Board. At that time, Ms. Castagnola served Respondent with a written Order to
produce all records of her supervision for the previous twenty-four (24) months pertaining to the
program of supervision maintained by her supervising physician (Order for Records).

8. On September 6, 2017, Respondent informed Ms. Castagnola, verbally and in
writing via letter dated the same day, that Respondent would cease practicing and comply with the
IC’s Order for Records.

9. On September 11, 2017, Respondent wrote a prescription to Patient A for
Phentermine, a Schedule IV controlled substance pursuant to NAC 453.540. Patient A’s true
identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy as a purported patient of Respondent, but is

disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent, along with a copy of this Complaint

(Patient Designation).

11. On September 27, 2017, Respondent wrote a prescription to Patient C for

substance pursuant to NAC 453.530. Patient C’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his
privacy as a purported patient of Respondent, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation.
Testosterone pellets must be inserted beneath the skin to be effective; implantation of testosterone

pellets are implanted during the procedure. Respondent’s handwritten prescription for the
testosterone pellets notes that they are for “Office Use.”

12. On information and belief, Respondent implanted the aforementioned Testosterone
Pellets into Patient C.

13. On September 28, 2017, Respondent was personally served the Suspension Order
by Board Investigators Donald Andreas and Kim Friedman.

Patient Designation.

15. On October 4, 2017, Respondent wrote a prescription to Patient E for Phentermine,
a Schedule IV controlled substance pursuant to NAC 453.540. Patient E’s true identity is not
disclosed herein to protect her privacy as a purported patient of Respondent, but is disclosed in the
