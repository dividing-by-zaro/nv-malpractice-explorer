FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT U

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board) hereby issues this First Amended Complaint (Complaint) against Angela Lorenzo, PA
(Respondent), a licensed physician assistant in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has
a reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the
Medical Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent’s license (License No. PA816) was suspended pursuant to the IC’s
Order of Summary Suspension filed September 28, 2017 (Suspension Order), which Suspension
Order is incorporated herein by this reference. Respondent has been licensed by the Board
pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice Act since December 9, 2003.

2. Pursuant to NAC 630.375(2), a physician assistant shall not perform medical
services without supervision from a supervising physician licensed and approved by the Board.

3. Pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(1), a physician assistant may not engage in any
conduct which is intended to deceive.

4, Pursuant to NRS 630.3065(2)(a), a licensee shall not knowingly or willfully fail to

comply with a subpoena or order of the Board.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, and Aury Nagy, M.D.

5. Pursuant to NRS 630.020, the “practice of medicine” means either (1) to
diagnose, treat, correct, prevent or prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity,
deformity or other condition, physical or mental, by any means or instrumentality, including, but
not limited to, the performance of an autopsy, or (2) to apply principles or techniques of medical
science in the diagnosis or the prevention of any such conditions, or (3) to offer, undertake,
attempt to do or hold oneself out as able to do any of the acts described in (1) and (2).

6. Pursuant to NRS 630.311(1), the IC must review each complaint made against a
licensee and conduct an investigation to determine if there is a reasonable basis for the complaint.
The IC may issue orders to aid its investigation, including, but not limited to, compelling a
licensee to appear before the IC.

7. On September 5, 2017, the Board was notified in writing by Respondent’s previous
supervising physician that such required supervision was terminated on July 1, 2017, and that
Respondent was therefore not currently supervised by a physician licensed and approved by the
Board.

8. On September 6, 2017, the Board’s Chief of Investigations, Pamela Castagnola,
personally presented to Respondent’s medical office, Modern Medical & Wellness, located at 911
N. Buffalo Drive, Suite 113, Las Vegas, NV 89128-8397, where Respondent was actively
performing medical services. Ms. Castagnola personally notified Respondent that she had no
supervising physician, and that she was prohibited, pursuant to NAC 630.375(2), from performing
medical services until there was a supervising physician for her practice that was licensed and
approved by the Board. At that time, Ms. Castagnola served Respondent with a written Order to
produce all records of her supervision for the previous twenty-four (24) months pertaining to the
program of supervision maintained by her supervising physician (First Order for Records).

9. To date, Respondent has failed to respond in any way to the First Order for
Records.

10. Also on September 6, 2017, Respondent informed Ms. Castagnola, verbally and in
writing via letter dated the same day, that Respondent would cease practicing and comply with the

IC’s First Order for Records.

11. Also on September 6, 2017, pursuant to a separate investigation of Respondent’s
alleged conduct related to BME Investigative Case No. 17-17442, the IC issued an Order to
Produce Health Care Records for the patient at issue from January 1, 2010, through September 6,
2017 (Second Order for Records). Respondent was ordered to respond to the Second Order for
Records within 21 days of service. The Second Order for Records was sent, along with an
Allegation Letter and Custodian of Records Affidavit, to Respondent via regular U.S.P.S. first-
class mail on September 6, 2017, to her office on record with the Board: 911 N. Buffalo Drive,
Suite 113, Las Vegas, NV 89128-8397.

12. Respondent did not respond to the Second Order for Records within 21 days as
ordered. Accordingly, on September 29, 2017, the Second Order for Records was sent again,
along with the original Allegation Letter and Custodian of Records Affidavit, to Respondent via
U.S.P.S. first-class mail to her office on record with the Board: 911 N. Buffalo Drive, Suite 113,
Las Vegas, NV 89128-8397.

13. Respondent again did not respond to the Second Order for Records. Accordingly,
on October 13, 2017, the Second Order for Records was sent a third time, along with the original
Allegation Letter and Custodian of Records Affidavit, this time to Respondent via U.S.P.S.
certified mail. The certified mailing was confirmed delivered to and signed for by the Respondent
on October 24, 2017.

14. To date, Respondent has failed to respond in any way to the Second Order for
Records.

15. Meanwhile, on September 11, 2017, Respondent wrote a prescription to Patient A
for Phentermine, a Schedule IV controlled substance pursuant to NAC 453.540. Patient A’s true
identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy as a purported patient of Respondent, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent, along with a copy of this Complaint
(Patient Designation).

16. On September 26, 2017, Respondent wrote a prescription to Patient B for

Phentermine, a Schedule IV controlled substance pursuant to NAC 453.540. Patient B’s true

pellets into Patient C.
