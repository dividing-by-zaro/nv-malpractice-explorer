Il. Statement of Nevada Law Applicable to “Medical Spas” and “Medical Directors”

Part A — Delegating Practitioners, Medical Assistants, and the Unlicensed Practice of
Medicine

2. Pursuant to NRS 630.400(1)(d), it is unlawful for any person to practice medicine
without being licensed by the Board under NRS 630, or by another medical professional licensing
board pursuant to chapters 631 to 637, inclusive, 639 or 640 of NRS.

3. Pursuant to NRS 630.020, the “practice of medicine” means either (1) to
diagnose, treat, correct, prevent or prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity,
deformity or other condition, physical or mental, by any means or instrumentality, including, but
not limited to, the performance of an autopsy, or (2) to apply principles or techniques of medical
science in the diagnosis or the prevention of any such conditions, or (3) to offer, undertake,
attempt to do or hold oneself out as able to do any of the acts described in (1) and (2).

4, Pursuant to NRS 630.305(1)(e), a Nevada physician or physician assistant
(practitioner) may not aid, assist, employ or advise, directly or indirectly, any unlicensed person to
engage in the practice of medicine contrary to the provisions of the Medical Practice Act, and
doing so is grounds for initiating disciplinary action or denying licensure.

5. Pursuant to the Medical Practice Act, the only means by which a practitioner may
lawfully aid, assist, employ or advise, directly or indirectly, an unlicensed person to engage in the
practice of medicine is by delegating specific tasks to an adequately supervised and trained
“medical assistant.” Pursuant to NRS 630.0129, a “medical assistant” means a person who (a)
performs clinical tasks under the supervision of a practitioner, and (b) does not hold a license,
certificate or registration issued by a professional licensing or regulatory board in this State to
perform such clinical tasks; the term does not include a person who performs only administrative,
clerical, executive or other nonclinical tasks.

6. Pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(r), a practitioner must adequately supervise his or her
medical assistants, and failing to do so is grounds for initiating disciplinary action or denying

licensure.

7. Pursuant to NAC 630.830, a delegating practitioner is professionally responsible
for the safety and performance of each task which is delegated to a medical assistant. Pursuant to
NAC 630.810, a delegating practitioner may not delegate tasks to a medical assistant unless: (a)
the delegating practitioner knows that the medical assistant possesses the knowledge, skill and
training to perform the task safely and properly; (b) the medical assistant is not required to be
certified or licensed to perform that task; and (c) the medical assistant is employed by the
delegating practitioner or the medical assistant and the delegating practitioner are employed by the
same employer.

8. Pursuant to NAC 630.820, a delegating practitioner may not supervise remotely a
medical assistant, except in a specific case of emergency in a rural area.’

9. Except as otherwise provided in NAC 630.820, pursuant to NAC 630.810, if a
medical assistant is delegated a task which involves an “invasive procedure”, the delegating
practitioner must be immediately available to exercise oversight in person while the medical
assistant performs the task.

10. The term “medical director” is not recognized or defined under any Nevada law or
regulation pertaining to the professional conduct and responsibility of licensed medical
professionals, and no law authorizes so-called “medical directors” to violate or circumvent the
aforementioned statutes and regulations of the Medical Practice Act.

11. Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 630.400(1)(d), 630.305(1)(e), and 630.0129, and
NAC 630.800-840:


2 Remote supervision of a medical assistant is prohibited unless: (a) the patient is located in a rural area; (b) the
delegating practitioner is physically located a significant distance from the location where the task is to be performed;
(c) the delegating practitioner determines that the exigent needs of the patient require immediate attention; (d) the
patient and the delegating practitioner previously established a practitioner-patient relationship; and (e) the delegating
practitioner is immediately available by telephone or other means of instant communication during the performance of
the task by the medical assistant. As used in NAC 630.820, “rural area” means any area in this State other than Carson
City or the City of Elko, Henderson, Reno, Sparks, Las Vegas or North Las Vegas.

3 The Medical Practice Act does not define “invasive procedure,” however, NAC 449.9733 pertaining to Medical
Facilities defines “invasive procedure” as “a medical procedure involving entry into the human body by puncture or
incision or by insertion of an instrument.”

a.

If a practitioner, whether by serving as a so-called “medical director” or by some
other relationship or circumstance, aids, assists, employs or advises, directly or
indirectly, any unlicensed person to engage in the practice of medicine, then the
practitioner may lawfully do so only by delegating tasks to an adequately
supervised, competent and properly trained medical assistant.

If a practitioner, whether by serving as a so-called “medical director” or by some
other relationship or circumstance, aids, assists, employs or advises, directly or
indirectly, any unlicensed person to engage in the practice of medicine, and if the
practitioner has not done so by delegating specific tasks to an adequately
supervised, competent and properly trained medical assistant, then (1) that
unlicensed person has violated NRS 630.400(1)(d), by practicing medicine without
a license, and (2) that practitioner has violated NRS 630.305(1)(e), and is subject to
discipline for aiding and abetting the unlicensed practice of medicine.

If a practitioner delegates a medical task to a medical assistant, whether by serving
as a so-called “medical director’ or by some other relationship or circumstance,
then the practitioner remains professionally responsible for the safety and
performance of each task, and remains professionally responsible for ensuring that
the proper employment relationships exist, that the medical assistant is properly
knowledgeable, trained and skilled, that the medical assistant is adequately
supervised, and the practitioner must be nearby to supervise the specific medical
tasks delegated, and, if it is an invasive medical task, then he or she must be
immediately available to exercise oversight in person while the medical assistant
performs the task.

If a practitioner delegates a medical task to a medical assistant, whether by serving
as a so-called “medical director” or by some other relationship or circumstance,
and if the practitioner fails to adequately supervise that medical assistant as

required under the circumstances, then that physician or physician assistant has

violated NRS 630.306(1)(r), and is subject to discipline for failing to adequately
supervise a medical assistant.
Part B — Cosmetologists, “Medical Spas” and “Medical Aestheticians,” and the Unlicensed
Practice of Medicine

12. Pursuant to NRS 644.023, 644.024, 644.0207 and 644.026, and in accord with
NRS 630.400(1)(d) and 630.020, a licensed “cosmetologist” is not authorized by such license to
practice medicine in any way. Rather, a licensed cosmetologist is authorized to perform only non-
medical, cosmetological services, such as cleansing, stimulating or massaging the scalp or
cleansing or beautifying the hair by the use of cosmetic preparations, antiseptics, tonics, lotions or
creams, cutting, trimming or shaping the hair, removing hair by electrolysis, depilatories, waxing
or tweezing, manicuring nails, massaging the skin, giving facials, and other miscellaneous non-
medical, cosmetological services.

13. Pursuant to NAC 644.368, a cosmetologist is further explicitly prohibited from
performing “invasive procedures,” which means for the purposes of professional licensing of
cosmetologists “an act that affects the structure or function of the skin other than the uppermost
layers of the skin,” and which for the sake of regulating the practice of cosmetologists includes,
without limitation, (a) the application of electricity for the sole purpose of contracting a muscle,
(b) the application of a topical lotion, cream or other substance which affects anything other than
the uppermost layers of the skin, (c) the penetration of the skin by needles, and (d) the abrasion of
the skin below the uppermost layers of the skin.

14. There is no such license as “medical aesthetician” authorized by any Nevada law or
issued by any Nevada sanctioned professional licensing body. The term “medical aesthetician” is
not recognized or defined under any Nevada law or regulation pertaining to the professional
conduct and responsibility of licensed medical professionals, and no law authorizes
cosmetologists to violate or circumvent the aforementioned statutes and regulations of the Nevada
Medical Practice Act by referring to themselves as “medical aestheticians.”

15. Accordingly, a Nevada licensed cosmetologist may not practice medicine in any

way, or perform invasive medical procedures or medical services of any kind, except as a

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

1105 Terminal Way #301
Reno, Nevada 89502

(775) 688-2559


“medical assistant” to a Nevada licensed medical professional, i.e., either as the medical assistant
of a Nevada licensed physician or physician assistant pursuant to NRS 630.0129, et. seq., and
NAC 630.800-830, as described above, or similarly as another type of professional “assistant,”
“hygienist,” “technician,” or other such designation, who is delegated tasks by and under the
direct supervision of another medical professional who is duly licensed pursuant to chapters 631
to 637, inclusive, 639 or 640 of NRS.

16. If a cosmetologist or so-called “medical aesthetician” practices or purports to
practice medicine in any way, unless he or she acts as a medical assistant and is delegated tasks
and is properly supervised by a professional medical practitioner, then he or she is violating NRS
630.400(1)(d) by practicing medicine without a license.

Part C — Nevada Pharmacy Laws Regarding Dangerous Drugs and Hypodermic Devices

17. NRS 630.306(1)(b)(3) provides that engaging in conduct that violates a regulation
adopted by the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy (Pharmacy Board) is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action.

18. Pursuant to NRS 454.201, a “dangerous drug” is any drug, other than a controlled
substance, unsafe for self-medication or unsupervised use, and includes, among other things, (1)
any drug which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for general distribution
and bears the legend: “Caution: Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription,” and (2)
any drug which, pursuant to the Board’s regulations, may be sold only by prescription because the
Board has found those drugs to be dangerous to public health or safety.

19. Pursuant to NRS 454.316 and NRS 454.321, it is unlawful to possess, dispense or
furnish a dangerous drug except when furnished to the person by a pharmacist pursuant to a legal
prescription from a practitioner.

20. Pursuant to NRS 454.009, a “hypodermic” device is any syringe, needle,
instrument, device or implement intended or capable of being adapted for the purpose of
administering drugs by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection.

21. Pursuant to NRS 454.510, it is unlawful for any person to have in his or her

possession or under his or her control any hypodermic device that is restricted by federal law to

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL

sale by or on the order of a physician, unless the person has acquired possession of such device in
accordance with the provisions of NRS 454.480 to 454.530, inclusive, that is, by sale from a
licensed pharmacist, on the prescription of a physician or other practitioner, which prescription is
filled as required by NRS 639.236, and may be refilled as authorized by the prescriber.

22. Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 454.009, 454.201, 454.316, 454.321 and 454.510,
a Nevada licensed cosmetologist is not permitted by Nevada law to possess, control, access,
prescribe, administer, and/or dispense dangerous drugs or hypodermic devices, except as a
Medical Assistant under the direct supervision of a Nevada licensed physician, physician assistant,
or other licensed medical professional, and then only if otherwise permitted and in compliance
with laws of regulating pharmacies and pharmaceuticals.

23. NAC 639.742(1) provides that a practitioner who wishes to dispense controlled
substances or dangerous drugs must apply to the Pharmacy Board for a certificate of registration
to dispense controlled substances or dangerous drugs. A practitioner must submit a separate
application for each site of practice, including, without limitation, any remote site or satellite
consultation site, from which the practitioner wishes to dispense controlled substances or
dangerous drugs.

24. NAC 639.742(2) provides that if a facility from which the practitioner intends to
dispense dangerous drugs or controlled substances is not wholly owned and operated by the
practitioner, the owner or owners of the facility must also submit an application to the Pharmacy
Board for a license to do so.

25. NAC 639.742(3) provides in pertinent part that a dispensing practitioner and, if
applicable, the owner or owners of the facility, shall ensure that:

(b) All drugs are received and accounted for by the dispensing practitioner;
(c) All drugs are stored in a secure, locked room or cabinet to which the dispensing
practitioner has the only key or lock combination;

(d) All drugs are dispensed in accordance with NAC 639.7454;

patients outside his or her presence shall:

(a) Keep complete, accurate and readily retrievable records of each controlled substance and dangerous drug
purchased and dispensed. The record for each such product dispensed to a patient must include:

(1) The name of the patient and, if not readily available from the practitioner’s records, the patient’s address;
(2) The name, strength and quantity of the prescribed controlled substance or dangerous drug;

(3) The directions for use;

(c) Keep all controlled substances and dangerous drugs in a locked storage area. Access to the storage area must
be restricted to the persons described in NRS 453.375.

manufacturer’s packages, is clearly labeled pursuant to the requirements set forth in NRS 639.2801.

(e) Ensure that the package or container in which a controlled substance or dangerous drug is dispensed complies
with all state and federal packaging requirements.

(f) Be deemed to be a pharmacy as that term is used in NAC 639.926 and shall comply with that section.

2. A practitioner may dispense dangerous drugs or controlled substances only after the patient has been informed
by the practitioner that the patient may request a written prescription and have it filled at another location of the
patient’s choosing.

3. A record regarding the dispensing of a controlled substance or dangerous drug made and kept pursuant to this
section must be maintained on paper or in a computer. If the record is:

26. NAC 639.742(4)(a)-(b) provides in part that with regard to the filling and
dispensing of a prescription at a facility, only the dispensing practitioner or a dispensing
technician may enter the room or cabinet in which drugs are stored, or remove drugs from stock.

27. NAC 639.945(1) provides in pertinent part that the following acts or practices by a

practitioner within the 6 months immediately preceding the date the practitioner dispenses or
prescribes a drug to the patient and, as a result of the examination, the practitioner diagnosed a
condition for which a given drug therapy is prescribed.

30. Accordingly, any physician or physician assistant who — whether by serving as a

59. Respondent neither received nor accounted for the dangerous drugs and
hypodermic devices administered and dispensed by Spa Dorin, nor did he ensure that such drugs
and hypodermic devices were stored in a secure, locked room or cabinet to which he had the only
key or lock combination. The dangerous drugs and hypodermic devices were not dispensed in

medically necessary purposes and according to prevailing standards of care, nor did he assure that
a certificate for each dispensing technician employed at the facility was displayed in the room or
cabinet in which drugs were stored.

60. Respondent supplied dangerous drugs and hypodermic devices so that unqualified
persons could circumvent laws pertaining to the legal sale of such articles, and allowed others to
dispense and prescribe dangerous drugs to those whom he did not have a bona fide therapeutic
relationship.

61. | Respondent failed to ensure that he had the required ownership or employment
relationship with respect to Spa Dorin, and failed to ensure that he had the legal and practical
control of Spa Dorin’s operations sufficient to effectively control the conduct of its employees and
agents in performance of all medical activities as his medical assistants or otherwise, in order to
prevent misconduct and ensure that his medical assistants possessed the knowledge, skill and training to
perform their tasks safely and properly.

63. NRS 630.306(1)(r) provides that a failure to adequately supervise a medical

assistant pursuant to the regulations of the Board is an act that constitutes grounds for initiating

‘disciplinary action.

64. By the conduct described herein, Respondent failed to adequately supervise, or
