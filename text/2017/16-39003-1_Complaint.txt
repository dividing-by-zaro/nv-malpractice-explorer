on his New York license. On or about March 8, 2016, the New York State Board of Professional
Medical Conduct adopted the terms of the consent agreement.

3. On or about April 2, 2015, the Virginia Board of Medicine notified Respondent
that it would convene a formal hearing to consider his application for licensure and issued a
Statement of Particulars alleging grounds for denying the application. The Statement of
Particulars alleged that Respondent provided fraudulent, false and misleading information in his
application dated October 2, 2012 by submitting two false evaluations that purported to be from
past employers and failing to disclose that he had been summarily suspended from the Obstetric
Fellowship by the Family Medicine Department at Louisiana State University — Lafayette on or
about February 17, 2006. The hearing was initially scheduled for May 14, 2015. However, based
on Respondent’s request, the hearing was rescheduled to June 19-20, 2015.

A, On or about July 15, 2015, the Virginia Board of Medicine denied Respondent’s
application for licensure on the following grounds: (1) submission of fraudulent, false or
misleading information by falsifying two evaluations by past employers; (2) engaging in fraud or
deceit in the course of obtaining admission to practice medicine by bringing a cell phone and pager
into the testing room during the examination, in violation of testing protocols; and (3)
incompetence to practice medicine based on his dismissal in January 2002 from the Floyd Medical
Center, Family Medicine Residency Program in Rome, Georgia, and his summary suspension on
or about February 17, 2006 from the Obstetrics Fellowship in the Department of Family Medicine
of the Louisiana State University, University Medical Center in Lafayette.”

5. On or about May 15, 2015, Respondent answered no to the following question on

the Nevada license renewal application:

2 Other states have brought complaints against Respondent, which are not at issue because they were
subsequent to Respondent’s submission of his 2015 renewal application. However, if any of those complaints results
in additional disciplinary action, any subsequent failures to timely report the same could be grounds for the initiation
of additional disciplinary action by the IC. Other states that have issued complaints include New Mexico, which issued
a Notice of Contemplated Action against Respondent on or about June 14, 2016; the Connecticut Department of
Public Health, which issued a Statement of Charges against Respondent on or about July 5, 2016; and the Florida
Department of Health, which issued two Administrative Complaints against Respondent on or about March 14, 2016

and on or about August 19, 2016.
