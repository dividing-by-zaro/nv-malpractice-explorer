District Court to 28-72 months of incarceration on each count, to run concurrently, which sentence
was suspended and Respondent was placed on probation for an indeterminate period not to exceed

five years and was required to register as a sex offender.

! The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) was composed of Board
