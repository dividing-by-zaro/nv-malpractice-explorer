Complaint Against | LE D>)

Steven Don Folkerth, M.D.,
OCT - 3 2017

NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

MEDIZAL EXAMINERS
By:

Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners,
hereby issues this formal Complaint against Steven Don Folkerth, M.D. (hereinafter referred to as
Dr. Folkerth or Respondent), a previously licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this
matter, the IC has a reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada
Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

1, Respondent was licensed in active status pursuant to NRS Chapter 630 (License
No. 7792) from June 6, 1996, until his license expired without application for renewal on June 30,
2015. NRS 630.298 provides that the expiration of a license by operation of law or by voluntary
surrender of a license does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction to proceed with any investigation
of, or action or disciplinary proceeding against, the licensee or to render a decision suspending or
revoking the license.

2. On February 23, 2015, Respondent provided written notice to the Board that states
he was closing his medical practice, and that his “new address” would be 10270 Atchison Road,

Dayton, Ohio 45458 (Dayton Address). The notice states that it was effective February 20, 2015.

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., and Mr. M. Neil

Duxbury.

The notice also states: “Medical records are being stored electronically. They will be available
either by mail to this address or at Steven.Folkerth@gmail.com.”

3. The Dayton Address is that of a personal residence in Dayton, Ohio.

4. In February 2015, Patient A had been a patient of Respondent for approximately
four years. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed
in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. Respondent provided no notice (written or otherwise) to Patient A, that Respondent
was terminating his medical care of Patient A, and Respondent made no arrangements for Patient
A’s continued care.

702-485-6442, but the number was disconnected. Patient A then visited Respondent’s medical
office at 7425 West Azure Drive, #150, Las Vegas, NV 89130 (Las Vegas Office), where
Respondent had treated Patient A previously. The office was closed and vacant, and a note was
posted on the office door providing the same information set forth in Paragraph 2 above. That
posted notice also stated that patient medical records would be available after March 1, 2015. No
other contact information was provided, other than the aforementioned email address,
Steven.Folkerth@gmail.com, and the Dayton Address.

7. After March 1, 2015, Patient A sent an email to Steven.Folkerth@gmail.com
requesting his medical records. Patient A received a reply from that email address indicating that
the records would be provided.

8. After receiving no further response, Patient A sent multiple additional messages to
that email address, which messages were not returned.

9, On June 9, 2015, a Board investigator sent an email to Respondent at
Steven.Folkerth@gmail.com requesting information regarding the location of his medical records.
No response to that message was received.

10. On July 2, 2015, pursuant to NRS 630.267, a formal Notice of Expiration of
License to Practice Medicine as a Medical Doctor was sent via U.S. Mail by the Board addressed
