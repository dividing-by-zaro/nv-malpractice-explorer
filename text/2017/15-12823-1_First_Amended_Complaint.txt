Duxbury, Member, and Aury Nagy, M.D., Member, by and through Robert Kilroy, Esq., Board

hereby issues its formal First Amended Complaint (Complaint), stating the IC’s charges and

so licensed by the Board since July 12, 1999, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice
Act.

2. Patient A was a forty-eight (48)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in

3. Patient A was admitted to St. Mary’s Hospital on September 9, 2010, with
diverticular disease complicated by the development of an abscess adjacent to the affected
sigmoid colon.

4. On September 10, 2010, Respondent discussed the various treatment options with

Patient A. After this discussion, Patient A agreed to undergo a colorectal anastomosis.

5. On September 13, 2010, Respondent performed a colorectal anastomosis on
Patient A.
6. Postoperatively, Patient A began passing green enteric fluid from her vagina.

7. On September 24, 2010, a different physician performed an exploratory
laparotomy. During this subsequent surgery, it was discovered that the physician assistant who
assisted Respondent placed the circular staple device in Patient A’s vagina instead of the rectum,
leading to a direct colovaginal anastomosis instead of a colorectal anastomosis.

8. Respondent’s failure to recognize the fact that the physician assistant’s placement
of the staple device was incorrect prior to stapling the anastomosis constitutes malpractice.

9. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

10. | NAC 630.230 states that a person who is licensed as a physician shall not engage in
prohibited professional conduct.

il. NAC 630.230(1)(i) states that it is prohibited professional conduct for a physician
to fail to provide adequate supervision of a physician assistant.

12. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to provide adequate supervision of his physician assistant when he failed to recognize the fact that
the physician assistant placed the staple device in the wrong location prior to stapling the
anastomosis.
