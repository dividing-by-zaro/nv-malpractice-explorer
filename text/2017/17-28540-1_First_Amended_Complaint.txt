By: Phere
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT \

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal First Amended Complaint against Angela Lorenzo, PA-C., (Respondent), a
licensed physician assistant in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a reasonable basis
to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) chapter 630
and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) chapter 630 (collectively, Medical Practice Act). The IC
alleges the following facts:

A, Respondent’s Licensure Status

1. Respondent is currently licensed in Nevada in active status (License No. PA816),
and has been so licensed by the Board since January 9, 2003.

B. Respondent’s Disreputable Conduct

2. On or about February 5, 2013, Respondent knowingly sent, or directed that her
patient, Patient X, send via FEDEX (or other express consignment company) a parcel from within
the State of Indiana to a “Shawn Smith” at “5033 Longhorn Way, Antioch, CA 94531,”
containing $185,070 in cash, in vacuum heat-sealed bundles (““Respondent’s Parcel”). Patient X’s
true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy as a purported patient of Respondent, but

is disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this First

! The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) was composed of Board
members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., member and M. Neil Duxbury, public
member.

Amended Complaint.

3. Respondent’s Parcel was intercepted by the Indiana State Police, and a canine
trained in narcotics detection alerted the officers to the scent of narcotics on the parcel.

4. Respondent’s Parcel was seized by the Indiana State Police and turned over to
Federal authorities, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(6), which reads in pertinent part: “The
following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States and no property right shall exist in
them: (6) All moneys, negotiable instruments, securities, or other things of value furnished or
intended to be furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled substance or listed chemical
in violation of this subchapter, all proceeds traceable to such an exchange, and all moneys,
negotiable instruments, and securities used or intended to be used to facilitate any violation of this
subchapter.”

5. On or about March 30, 2013, and subsequently, Respondent attested under penalty
of perjury in a series of written declarations that the $185,070 in cash was “100%” hers, and was
being sent to herself at the aforementioned address in Antioch, CA, which is 541 miles away from
Respondent’s then residence at 1404 Peyton Stewart Court, North Las Vegas, Nevada 89086.

6. Respondent demanded its return under 18 U.S.C. § 983(a)(2)(A), noting her
address as P.O. Box 36190, Las Vegas, NV 89133.

7. On April 8, 2014, $92,535 of that seized cash, the entirety of which Respondent
claimed was “100%” hers, was ordered “forfeited” to the U.S. government pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §
881(a)(6) as money furnished in exchange for a controlled substance.

8. Accordingly, Respondent, a licensed physician assistant in active practice, with a
license to prescribe controlled substances, had $92,535 seized and forfeited to the federal
government pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(6).

Count I
NRS 630.301(9) (Disreputable Conduct)
9. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference
as though fully set forth herein.

10. Conduct that brings the medical profession into disrepute is grounds for discipline
pursuant to NRS 630.301(9), including, without limitation, conduct that violates any provision of
a code of ethics adopted by the Board by regulation based on a national code of ethics.

11. The seizure and forfeiture of $92,535 of Respondent’s money that was found by a
U.S. District Court to be derived from dealings in controlled substances, under the circumstances
set forth herein, constitutes engaging in conduct that brings the medical profession into disrepute.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

C. Respondent’s Deceptive Conduct

13. In claiming that $185,070 in cash, in vacuum heat-sealed bundles, was “100%
hers,” Respondent declared under penalty of perjury in a written statement dated March 30, 2013:
“I withdrew the funds from my bank account at Bank of America and entrusted the Funds to
[Patient X], my fiancée and business partner, to purchase an airplane as part of a business
venture.” [emphasis added].

14. | Respondent repeated this statement in her verified Answer to the Complaint of
forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(6), on November 27, 2013.

15. Engaging in any sexual activity with a patient who is currently being treated by a
practitioner is grounds for discipline pursuant to NRS 630.301(5).

16. In a letter from Board Investigator, Don Andreas, dated December 23, 2014, Mr.
Andreas inquired, “It is alleged that you are engaging in a sexual relationship with patient and
finance [sic][should read “fiancée”] [Patient X]. Therefore, your treatment may have fallen below
the standard of care.”

17. In a letter dated March 16, 2015, Respondent stated (in bold print): “In regards to

the allegations that we [Patient X and I] are engaged, that simply is not true. He [Patient X] is not


OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

1105 Terminal Way #301
Reno, Nevada 89502

(775) 688-2559



my fiancée. He is a friend, a business associate as stated previously, and an active patient.”

18. Accordingly, when trying to retrieve her $185,070 in cash seized as suspected
drug-money, Respondent claimed to Federal authorities that Patient X was “my fiancée and
business partner,” but when the Board’s investigator presented the allegation that Respondent may
be improperly engaging in a sexual relationship with her patient, Respondent insisted that this
claim “. .. simply is not true. He is not my fiancée.”

Count IT
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(1) (Deceptive Conduct)

19. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference

21. Respondent’s statements to either the Board or Federal authorities, or both, were
patently deceptive and intended to deceive.

22. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

24. For these offenses, Respondent had her “dispensing practitioner” license revoked
by the Pharmacy Board on July 18, 2012, which revocation became official on August 17, 2012,
and such revocation was reported to the National Practitioners Data Bank.

25. On June 12, 2013, on her 2013-2015 Nevada Physician Assistant License Renewal

charged with, convicted of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to [any offense of federal, state or
local law]. . . or for any offense which is related to the . . . dispensing of controlled substances?”

misleading, inaccurate or incomplete statement is grounds for discipline pursuant to NRS

false, misleading, and inaccurate statement when she did not report on her license renewal
application that she was investigated for, charged with, and pled nolo contendere to three counts
related to the dispensing of controlled substances by the Pharmacy Board in 2013.

29. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
