ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION |

On September 28, 2017, the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) staff

presented evidence and information to the Investigative Committee of Board, composed of Wayne
Hardwick, M.D., Chairman, Aury Nagy, M.D., Member, and M. Neil Duxbury, Public Member,
regarding Angela Lorenzo, PA-C (Licensee). Upon review of the evidence and information
presented by Board staff, the Investigative Committee hereby IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDS the
license to practice medicine of Licensee pursuant to NRS 630.326(1) based upon the following
preliminary findings:

1. Pursuant to NAC 630.375(2), a physician assistant shall not perform medical
services without supervision from a supervising physician licensed and approved by the Board.

2. Pursuant to NRS 630.304(1), a licensee shall not maintain a license to practice
medicine by fraud or misrepresentation or by any false, misleading, inaccurate or incomplete
statement.

3. Pursuant to NRS 630.3065(2)(a), a licensee shall not knowingly or willfully fail to
comply with a subpoena or order of the Board.

4. On September 5, 2017, the Board was notified in writing by Licensee’s previous
supervising physician that such supervision terminated on July 1, 2017, and that Licensee is
therefore not currently supervised by a physician licensed and approved by the Board.

5. On September 6, 2017, IC staff personally notified Licensee at her offices located

at 911 N. Buffalo Drive, Suite 113, Las Vegas, NV 89128-8397, where she was actively

performing medical services, that she had no supervising physician, and that she was prohibited
pursuant to NAC 630.375(2) from performing medical services until she obtained a supervising
physician licensed and approved by the Board. At that time, the IC staff also served Licensee with
a written Order to produce all records of her supervision for the previous twenty-four (24) months
pertaining to the program of supervision maintained by her supervising physician.

6. On September 6, 2017, Respondent informed the IC verbally and in writing that
she would cease practicing and comply with the IC’s Order to produce records of her supervision.

7. On September 11, 2017, Licensee wrote a prescription to a patient for Phentermine,
a Schedule IV controlled substance pursuant to NAC 453.540(5).

8. As of this writing, Licensee has not produced any records in response to the IC’s
Order of September 6, 2017.

9. Therefore, Licensee is performing medical services, including the prescription of
controlled substances, (1) without supervision, in violation of NAC 630.375(2), and (2) in direct
contradiction to her prior written statement to the Board on September 6, 2017, in violation of
NRS 630.304(1). Licensee is also knowingly and willfully failing to comply with the IC’s lawful
Order to produce medical records, in violation of NRS 630.3065(2)(a).

Based thereon, the IC believes that the health, safety and welfare of the public is at
imminent risk of harm by Licensee’s continued performance of medical services without
supervision, including the prescription of controlled substances, by her dishonest conduct, and by
her continued refusal to comply with the lawful Orders of the Board. Based upon the
aforementioned, the IC reasonably believes that a summary suspension of Licensee’s medical
license is necessary to remove said risk of imminent harm to the health, safety and welfare of the
public as authorized and pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
of ANGELA LORENZO, PA-C, (License No. PA816) is hereby suspended until further order of
the IC or Board; and

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that pursuant to NRS 630.326(2), a hearing be set of this
Order at 1:30 p.m., on Wednesday, November 29, 2017, at the Board’s offices at 1105 Terminal
