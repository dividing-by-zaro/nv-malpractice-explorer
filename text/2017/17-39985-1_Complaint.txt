Respondent’s false testimony under oath that she was not an employee or independent contractor

for a weight loss clinic, when in fact she was an independent contractor for the weight loss clinic,
serving as its medical director. As the medical director, Respondent delegated the provision of
medical services to individuals not licensed to practice medicine and was subject to the
requirements of Colorado Medical Board Rule 800, 3 C.C.R. 713-30. Pursuant to Colorado
Medical Board Rule 800, the Colorado Medical Board requested that Respondent provide the
delagatee’s qualifications to the Board. Respondent refused multiple times to provide the
requested documentation. Respondent admitted that her refusal to comply with a valid board order
or any rule or regulation promulgated by the board in conformance with law constituted
unprofessional conduct.

3. Respondent received a letter of admonition and her Colorado license to practice
medicine was placed on probation for five years, commencing on July 14, 2016. During the period
of probation, Respondent is not allowed to delegate the rendering of medical services to a person
who is not licensed to practice medicine. Respondent is not authorized to act as a primary
supervisor of physician assistants. Respondent is not allowed to delegate the rendering of medical
services to a physician assistant or act as a secondary supervisor to a physician assistant, except
under certain circumstances. Respondent was further ordered to complete a Professional/Problem
Based Ethics Program.

4, Respondent did not timely report the July 14, 2016 Stipulation and Final Agency
Order to the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners.
