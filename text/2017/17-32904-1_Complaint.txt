hereby issues this formal Complaint against Kiarash L. Mirkia, M.D. (hereinafter referred to as

the Medical Practice Act).

was issued his license from the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners on December 1, 2007,

A. Respondent’s Misrepresentations in Renewing His License

2. On August 6, 2013, Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center (Sunrise Hospital)
summarily suspended Respondent’s medical staff member and clinical privileges at Sunrise
Hospital. The basis for this suspension was a complaint received by Sunrise Hospital alleging

Respondent engaged in inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature on hospital premises.

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., and Mr. M. Neil
Duxbury.
