COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners,

hereby issues this formal Complaint against Poupak P. Ziaei, M.D. (hereinafter referred to as
Dr. Ziaei or Respondent), a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC
has a reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised
Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively,
the Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 12525). Respondent
was issued her license from the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners on November 14,
2007, pursuant to the provisions of NRS Chapter 630.

2. On March 7, 2014, a Costco employee working in Costco’s Loss Prevention
Division filed a report with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department regarding a female
shopper who hid certain clothing and cosmetic items in her purse. The female shopper paid for

grocery items, but exited the store without paying for the items hidden in her purse. The Costco

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., and Mr. M. Neil

Duxbury.

card used by the female shopper belonged to Respondent. After being confronted by the
aforementioned Costco employee and another Costco employee, Respondent continued on her
way and entered a black BMW vehicle with a Nevada license plate of 374-XBU. The Costco
employees took photographs of the female shopper, which Kiarash Mirkia, M.D. (Dr. Mirkia)
later identified as his wife, the Respondent.

3. On March 10, 2014, Respondent and her husband presented to the Las Vegas
Metropolitan Police Department, stating that she was the suspect in a petit larceny from Costco
and wished to pursue battery charges against Costco employees. Respondent’s identification was
verified, and she stated that she arrived at the police department in her black BMW with Nevada
plate 374-XBU.

4, Respondent denied concealing items upon her person before exiting the store
without paying for those items, and claimed that she was approached by a female who claimed to
be a Costco employee. She said that the employee attempted to take her into custody, but that
Respondent refused. Respondent stated that the employee had pulled upon Respondent’s upper
body and arm in an unwanted manner.

5. A bench warrant was issued for Parinaz Parchehbafziaei, aka Poupak Ziaei, on or
about June 30, 2014. A criminal complaint and summons were issued to Parinaz Parchehbafziaie
on May 14, 2014 and May 25, 2014, respectively.

6. Respondent contends that Parinaz Parchehbafziaie is her sister, and that it was her
sister who was the female shopper in question.

7. Respondent’s sister, Parinaz Parchehbafziaie, had been detained by the Department
of Homeland Security on December 31, 2010 and deported on January 20, 2011. Respondent’s
sister applied for a visa to the United States on or about September 5, 2013, but was denied.

8. If the female shopper in question was Respondent’s sister, then Respondent’s sister
had possession of Respondent’s Costco card and vehicle, and, upon information and belief,
Respondent was aiding and abetting an illegal alien because her sister had no legal right to be in
the United States.

9. Respondent failed to disclose the investigation, criminal complaint and bench
warrant on her 2015 Nevada license renewal application.

10. From September, 20, 2015 through January 2, 2016, Respondent prescribed
phentermine to her husband five times, and carisoprodol to her husband one time. Respondent
does not have medical records to support the medical basis for prescribing those substances to her
husband.

11. In the month of January 2016, Respondent sent multiple e-mails to an adult female,
Monica Diosa, whom Respondent contended was having an affair with her husband, Dr. Mirkia.
Respondent’s e-mails contained threatening, malicious and harassing language, and on at least one
occasion, Respondent threatened both Ms. Diosa and her minor child.

12. At some point in late 2015 or early 2016, Respondent went to Ms. Diosa’s
apartment to confront her, and threatened to kill Ms. Diosa and her son.

13. Ms. Diosa obtained a temporary protective order against Respondent on or about
January 22, 2016, which was served on or about February 1, 2016. The temporary protective
order was in force and effect for 30 days from the date of service.

14. On or about March 4, 2016, a maintenance worker for the apartment complex
where Ms. Diosa resides observed Respondent and Dr. Mirkia driving around the complex on
several occasions, walking about the complex and taking photos around the apartment unit
occupied by Ms. Diosa.

15. On November 17, 2016, pursuant to NRS 630.318, the IC ordered Respondent to
undergo a psychiatric examination by a psychiatrist due to reasonable questions existing as to
Respondent’s competency, demeanor and possible mental and/or physical impairments, to the
extent that such affect her ability to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety to patients.

16. Respondent presented for and was evaluated by a psychiatrist on November 28,
2016.

17. Based on information obtained by the IC, the IC has reason to believe that
Respondent is unable to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety because of illness, a

mental or physical condition or the use of alcohol, drugs, narcotics or any other substance.
