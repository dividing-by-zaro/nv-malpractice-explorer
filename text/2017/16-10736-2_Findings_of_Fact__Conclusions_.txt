against Respondent, and finds them to be reasonable based on: (1) the abilities, training,
education, experience, professional standing and skill demonstrated by Board staff and attorneys;
(2) the character of the work done, its difficulty, its intricacy, its importance, the time and skill
required, the responsibility imposed and the prominence and character of the parties where, as in
this case, they affected the importance of the litigation; (3) the work actually performed by

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
I.

The Board has jurisdiction over Respondent and the Complaint, and an adjudication of this
matter by the Board members as set forth herein is proper.

Respondent was timely and properly served with the Complaint, and all notices and orders
in advance of the hearing and adjudication thereon, in accord with NRS and NAC Chapters 630,
NRS Chapter 233B, and the requirements of due process.
Ill.
NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is an act, among others, that constitutes grounds
for the Board to initiate disciplinary action.
IV.
NAC 630.040 provides that malpractice is the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.
V.
The Board concludes that Respondent has violated NRS 630.301(4) as alleged in Counts J,
IL, I and IV of the Complaint and, accordingly, is subject to discipline pursuant to NRS 630.352.
