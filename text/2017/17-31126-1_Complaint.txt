The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners,
hereby issues this formal Complaint against Aris Q. Urbanes, M.D. (hereinafter referred to as
Dr. Urbanes or Respondent), a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the
IC has a reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised

the Medical Practice Act).

was issued his license from the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners on February 14, 2006,
pursuant to the provisions of NRS Chapter 630.

2. On April 19, 2016, the Maryland Board of Physicians and Respondent entered into
a Consent Order. The Consent Order was based on Respondent’s failure to complete 50
continuing medical education credits for reinstatement of his Maryland license. Respondent’s

Maryland license was set to expire on September 30, 2015. On September 17, 2015, Respondent

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., and Mr. M. Neil

Duxbury.

signed the affirmation in his Maryland Application for Reinstatement of Medical License that he
had obtained the required 50 credit hours. Respondent was only able to provide evidence of 11.75
hours of the required 50 credit hours. As part of the Consent Order, Respondent agreed to pay an
administrative fine of $3,825.00 and, before renewing the Maryland license in 2017, provide proof
of 50 hours of Category 1 continuing medical education credits plus the outstanding 38.25 hours
required during the 2015 renewal period.

3. Respondent did not timely report the April 19, 2016 Consent Order to the Nevada

State Board of Medical Examiners.

5. NRS 630.301(3) provides that any disciplinary action, including the revocation,

with Respondent regarding his failure to comply with the Maryland continuing medical education
requirement.

7. The April 19, 2016 Consent Order was a disciplinary action taken by another state.

initiating disciplinary action.

Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.
