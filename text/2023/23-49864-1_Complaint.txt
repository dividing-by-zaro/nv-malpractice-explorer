5. On February 24, 2020, Patient A was referred to a high-risk pregnancy physician
for supervision of her pregnancy.

6, On June 26, 2020, Patient A switched to another high-risk pregnancy physician,
with regular visits to Respondent for her obstetrical care for the remainder of her pregnancy.
These visits included regular ultrasounds to monitor growth and the health of the pregnancy due to
the increased risk of complications due to a twin pregnancy.

7. On July 20, 2020, the high-risk pregnancy physician noted there was
polyhydramnios, which is the presence of too much amniotic fluid, in the medical note to the
Respondent. The high-risk pregnancy physician recommended Patient A be delivered from weeks
thirty-seven and zero days (37/0) to thirty-seven and three days (37/3).

8. On August 3, 2020, ultrasound testing demonstrated an isolated growth restriction
on Twin A. The high-risk pregnancy physician again recommended that Patient A be delivered
from weeks thirty-seven and zero days (37/0) to thirty-seven and three days (37/3).

9. On August 13, 2020, further ultrasound testing confirmed worsening growth
restriction of Twin A, with the high-risk pregnancy physician maintaining their recommendation
for the thirty-seven and zero days (37/0) to thirty-seven and three days (37/3) delivery window.

10. On August 10, 2020, despite clear recommendations to the contrary, Respondent
requested and scheduled a cesarean section to take place on August 17, 2020, at thirty-seven
weeks and five days (37/5).

11. On August 12, 2020, Patient A was seen by Respondent to discuss the most recent
ultrasound report and the risks associated with the scheduled cesarean section. Respondent did
not change the date of the delivery, despite recent ultrasound testing and the recommendation of
the high-risk pregnancy physician, nor did he document any medical reasoning for deviating from
the delivery recommendation.

12. On August 16, 2020, Patient A presented to the hospital with vaginal bleeding and
pain. Ultrasound testing demonstrated Twin A had no heartbeat, due to intrauterine fetal demise
and placental abruption. An emergency cesarian section was performed to deliver Twin B.
