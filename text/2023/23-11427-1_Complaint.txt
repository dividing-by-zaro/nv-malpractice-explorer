4. On June 20, 2019, Respondent performed cataract surgery on Patient A’s left eye
including the implantation of an intraocular lens. During the procedure, Respondent failed to
correctly conduct a biometry reading to determine the correct intraocular lens to implant.

5. Preoperative notes document Patient A’s cornea was clear. Respondents post-
operative note stated that intraoperative testing to confirm which intraocular lens to select was
impossible due to a damaged cornea.

6. On June 21, 2019, Patient A returned to Respondent for a post-operative
examination with complaints of eye irritation in the left eye. Respondent documented that
Patient A had a corneal abrasion and recommended that he follow-up in one-week.

7. On June 25, 2019, Patient A retuned for his follow-up appointment and reported
the inability to read without the assistance of a magnifying glass. Diagnostic testing confirmed
that Respondent had selected the incorrect lens for the left eye during the cataract surgery that was
performed on June 20, 2019.

8 Respondent performed a lens exchange procedure on July 2, 2019. Patient A
continued to follow-up with Respondent, who attempted several corneal scraping procedures.
