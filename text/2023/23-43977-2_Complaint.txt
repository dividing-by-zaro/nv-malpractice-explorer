COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Ira Alan Klein, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 16161). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on October 13, 2015.

2. Patient A? was a fifty-six (56) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. On January 24, 2018, Patient A was admitted to St. Rose Dominican Hospital with
a left foot infection.

4. On January 27, 2018, at or around 8:15 a.m., Patient A was taken to the operating
room for surgery on his left foot. Respondent was the anesthesiologist during the surgery.


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ahsan,
M.D., Ph.D., FACC, and Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.).

5. Respondent’s pre-operative evaluation indicated that Respondent suffered from
obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, and probable difficulty with intubation.

6. Prior to the surgery, Respondent provided pre-oxygenation to Patient A. However,
Respondent’s medical record from the January 27, 2018, surgery did not mention any other

methods of airway preparation undertaken by Respondent.

7. Respondent then induced general anesthesia and placed a laryngeal mask airway
(LMA) in Patient A.
8. After placement of the LMA, Respondent was unable to effectively secure

Patient A’s airway with the LMA, or otherwise effectively ventilate Patient A. As a result,
Patient A’s heart rate and blood pressure dropped, and Patient A suffered cardiac arrest.

9. A code blue was called at or around 8:38 a.m. Chest compressions and epinephrine
were then administered. Respondent attempted both a direct laryngoscopy and Glidescope.

10. Respondent’s medical record from the January 27, 2018, surgery does not indicate
that other airway management maneuvers were undertaken, or that alternative modes of
ventilation, including oral and nasal airways, were used.

11. After Respondent’s second attempt to place an LMA, Patient A’s heart rate and
blood pressure then improved and Patient A was stabilized at or around 9:00 a.m. Patient A’s
surgery was then initiated.

12. Patient A was unable to wake up from general anesthesia after the surgery.
Patient A was taken to the ICU, where Patient A was diagnosed with a severe anoxic brain injury.
Patient A did not recover any type of meaningful neurological function. Patient A passed away on
February 1, 2018.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

13. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL

"1

15. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

16. | As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A on January 27, 2018, by (1) failing to adequately prepare
for dealing with Patient A’s difficult airway prior to surgery; (2) failing to adequately and timely
attempt means to secure Patient A’s airway once Respondent knew that the LMA failed to secure
Patient A's airway; and (3) failing to attempt alternative modes of ventilation when Patient A’s
airway was not secure.

17. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Appropriate Medical Records

18. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

19. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

20. Respondent failed to maintain complete and proper medical records relating to the
diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to document his actions when he treated
Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete. Respondent’s
medical records on January 27, 2018, did not adequately list Respondent’s methods of airway
preparation prior to the surgery, and were generally illegible and failed to sufficiently document
the failure to secure Patient A’s airway.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:
