registration issued by the Pharmacy Board in an incompetent, unskillful or negligent manner is
unprofessional conduct and conduct contrary to the public interest:

Pharmacy Board “could present such evidence at an administrative hearing to establish a factual
basis” for certain violations alleged against him in the Pharmacy Board Accusation, including
violations of NRS 453.236(1), NRS 453.331, and NAC 639.945(1)(h), (i), and (j). See Exhibit 1.

and -dated prescriptions during 2017 to coincide with scheduled patient visits.” Id.

12. Pursuant to the Pharmacy Board Stipulation, Respondent agreed that the admitted
violations were “grounds for disciplinary action” by the Pharmacy Board, and he stipulated to

specific penalties therefore. Id.
