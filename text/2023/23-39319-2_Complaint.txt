= On June 27, 2018, Patient A was placed on opioid pain medications for
postoperative pain management.

6. During his stay at St. Rose, Patient A’s heart rate was almost entirely in the sinus
tachycardia range, i.e, a heart rate above 100 beats per minute (BPM). Respondent did not note or
comment on Patient A's elevated heart rate in his medical records.

7. During Patient A’s stay at St. Rose, daily chemistry studies showed patterns
consistent with dehydration. These patterns indicated how much vomiting Patient A was having
during his stay at St. Rose. Respondent did not mention these chemistry study patterns in his
notes for Patient A.

8. Additionally, during the surgery, Patient A suffered two small dural tears that
required closure with sutures, Patient A’s surgeon instructed that Patient A had to lie flat on his
bed for three days after the surgery, to allow the tears to heal. In such a setting, there is a risk of
aspiration, which requires patients such as Patient A to be positioned with the head of the bed
elevated to prevent regurgitation or backwards flow of gastrointestinal contents into the airway.

9. On June 29, 2018, Patient A complained of abdominal distension. Imaging studies
taken on June 29, 2018, suggested that Patient A was developing a progressively worsening ileus,
or a bowel obstruction. Patient A’s last bowel movement had been on June 27, 2018, the day of
his surgery.

10. On the night of June 29, 2018, a nurse spoke with Respondent concerning Patient
A’s vomiting.

Il. On the night of June 30, 2018, Patient A complained of difficulty breathing.
Nursing notes indicated that Patient A’s heart rate was very rapid, despite being given metoprolol
to slow his heart rate. Respondent was informed of Patient A’s heart rate and told the nursing
staff to only call him if Patient A’s heart rate was above 130 BPM and Patient A was
symptomatic.

12. Respondent was later called on July 1, 2018, due to complaints of difficulty
breathing and a heart rate of between 110-139 BPM. Respondent ordered Xopenex and Xanax

1 mg, to be administered to Patient A.

13. Xopenex is only indicated for bronchospasms, which Patient A did not shown signs
of during his stay at St. Rose.

14. Further imaging was obtained on July 1, 2018, and results showed progressive
multiple loops of dilated large and small bowel with gaseous extension of the stomach, all of|
which is consistent with aggressive ileus.

15. On July 1, 2018, Respondent observed the imaging results and spoke with
Patient A, who reported ongoing nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, with no improvement.

16. Also, on July 1, 2018, Respondent conducted a post imaging physical examination
of Patient A, and Respondent described Patient A as in no acute distress. Respondent's findings
on an abdominal exam of Patient A were “soft, slightly distended.” Respondent recorded Patient
A’s course as improving. Respondent further did not note that the July 1, 2018, imaging results
described gaseous distention of the stomach.

17. On the night of July 1, 2018, Respondent was notified that Patient A continued to
have shortness of breath and an elevated heart rate Respondent ordered Xopenex and metoprolol
for Patient A’s breathing and heart rate.

18. Also, on July 1, 2018, Respondent ordered oral medications for Patient A,
including miralax, docusate, and Maalox for constipation. Administration of these medications,
combined with additional fluid in Patient A’s stomach, could have caused Patient A’s increasing
nausea and vomiting, and increased the risk of aspiration.

19. On July 2, 2018, Patient A complained of severe shortness of breath. A CT
angiogram of the chest was taken, demonstrating infiltrates in the right mid and lower lung,
consistent with aspiration, and significant distension of the stomach.

20. A patient with progressive ileus, ongoing opioid pain medication administration,

oral administration of constipation medication, physical limitations, clinical evidence of|

abdominal distension corroborated by radiological findings, and the absence of bowel movements
would normally alert providers to aspiration risks.

21. On July 2, 2018, Patient A displayed progressively worsening shortness of breath
and oxygen desaturation. Patient A was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit at St. Rose
Patient A then developed pulseless electrical activity cardiac arrest and passed away.

22. Hospital staff noted Patient A’s cause of death to be cardiopulmonary arrest
secondary to pulseless electrical activity secondary to aspiration.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

23. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

24. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

25. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “‘the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

26. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, by (1) failing to properly and timely address Patient A’s
condition, including progressively worsening ileus, continuous vomiting, elevated heart rate, and
gaseous distention of the stomach; (2) failing to order more diagnostic studies; and (3) failing to
note the aggregated risks of aspiration in light of Patient A’s clinical presentation. Respondent’s
failure to properly and timely address Patient A’s worsening condition includes, but is not limited
to, the failure to order diagnostic studies on the night of July 1, 2018, such as a CT angiogram of |
the chest.

27. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

reference as though fully set forth herein.

30. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions and Patient A’s
condition when he treated Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate,
and complete. Respondent failed to note Patient A’s continuing tachycardia, note the findings
from Patient A’s July 1, 2018, abdominal x-ray report describing gaseous distention of the
stomach, and failed to note Patient A’s daily chemistry studies showing a pattern consistent with
dehydration and likely an indication of how much vomiting Patient A was having. Further,
despite imaging studies showing increasing distention of Patient A’s bowels, and Patient A’s
complaints of abdominal pain, Respondent merely noted that Patient A’s abdomen was soft and
slightly distended.

31. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent 1s subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays.
