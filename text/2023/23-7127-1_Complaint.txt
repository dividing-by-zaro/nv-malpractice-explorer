3. On September 19, 2007 Patient A was seen by the Respondent for hormone
replacement therapy. The treatment plan prepared by Respondent without clinical reasoning,
baseline testing nor diagnosis, was for testosterone micronized powder (TMP) which is a schedule
III controlled substance.

4. Patient A was seen again by Respondent on March 19, 2008, and he continued the
same hormone therapy by prescribing TMP on this date, again without clinical reasoning, nor a
formal diagnosis.

5. December 15, 2010 diagnostic testing was performed on Patient A and her salivary
hormone results showed Testosterone above the normal range.

6. Respondent submitted prescriptions for TMP from April 2, 2009 through June 19,
2017 for Patient A, over five thousand seven hundred (5,700) days worth of TMP with twenty-two

(22) prescriptions.
COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice
7. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

reference as though fully set forth herein.

8. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

9. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

10. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A. Specifically, he did not order a baseline laboratory test
prior to initation of prescriptions for TMP. Documentation does not indicate that Respondent
discussed signs and symptoms that Patient A had been experiencing that would prompt the
treatment with a testosterone replacement. Respondent wrote for five thousand seven hundred

(5,700) days of worth of testosterone from 2009 through 2017 for Patient A without a proper

diagnosis of a condition or ailment for which TMP would be an appropriate medication therapy.
Additionally, Respondent only checked Patient A’s testosterone levels twice during the the eight
(8) year period, the last time being in 2010, when it was four (4) times higher than the upper limit.

11. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

14. Respondent failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions when
he prescribed a schedule IV controlled substance to Patient A.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

PATIENT B

16. Patient B? was a twenty-seven (27) year old female of which Respondent had a
close personal relationship at the time of the events at issue.

17. On December 6, 2016, Respondent prescribed zolpidem tartrate, a schedule IV

physician-patient relationship existed nor did Respondent provide any clinical reasoning for his
prescription of the schedule IV controlled substance. Specifically, there was no record of this
patient having been seen at Respondent’s clinic even though a prescription sleep aid was provided

symptoms that started at the time of her hysterectomy that included being weak, tired, headaches,
fatigue, and brain fog. Respondent prescribed Patient C TMP, a schedule III controlled substance.

24. On December 21, 2016, Respondent once again evaluated Patient C for follow-up
after starting the hormone cream. She indicated she was feeling better and had no side effects, so

prescribing testosterone.

Additionally, there is no baseline diagnostic report provided in the medical records file which is
necessary before providing supplemental hormones such as testosterone.

33. On March 15, 2016, Respondent prescribed himself zolpidem tartrate, a schedule

substance included in schedule II, III or IV for the practitioner’s own personal use except in a
medical emergency.

41, Respondent did not prescribe testosterone cyionate or zolpidem tartrate to himself
