4. Patient A was specifically transferred from the Arizona hospital to Sunrise for a CT
myelogram and further evaluation of Patient A’s back pain accompanied by lower extremity
weakness and numbness.

5. Upon arnval at Sunrise on September 1, 2019, an Emergency Department
physician ordered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of Patient A’s lumbar spine.

6. After presenting to the Emergency Department at Sunrise, Patient A was admitted
to the care of Respondent on September 2, 2019.

7. On September 2, 2019, at or about 4:23 p.m., Respondent performed a physical
examination of Patient A, including a test of motor strength. Respondent noted that Patient A
moved all his extremities, except his lower left extremity. Respondent further noted that,
according to the Arizona hospital, Patient A had urinary retention.

8 According to Respondent’s notes from the September 2, 2019, physical
examination, Respondent did not document Patient A’s rectal sphincter tone via digital rectal
exam, permeal sensation, or a neurological examination consisting of palpation of the spine,
reflexes, sensation gait, and straight leg testing.

9. Respondent's notes from the physical examination further do not indicate that
Respondent contacted a neurosurgeon on September 2, 2019, despite Patient A’s history of urinary
retention and lower extremity weakness.

10. An MRI of Patient A’s lumbar spine was taken later on September 2, 2019. The
MRI report, written at or about 10:01 p.m., showed cauda equina compression at the L2-L3 disc
level.

11. On September 3, 2019, Respondent again evaluated Patient A, and requested a
neurosurgery consultation after learning of the MRI report.

12. On September 4, 2019, Patient A was evaluated by a neurosurgeon. Patient A then
received surgery to decompress his spinal cord on the same day.

19. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

20. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document her actions when she treated
Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.
On September 2, 2019 Respondent did not document that she conducted a thorough examination
of Patient A, including performance of measuring Patient A’s rectal sphincter tone via digital
rectal exam, testing perineal sensation, and conducting a neurological examination consisting of
palpation of the spine, reflexes, sensation gait, and straight leg testing.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT It
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation —

22. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

23. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

24. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the

25. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition on or about September 2, 2019. Upon discovery of Patient A’s lower extremity
weakness during Patient A’s physical examination, Respondent should have immediately
consulted with an appropriate care provider, such as a neurosurgeon, to address the diagnosis of
Patient A’s medical condition. Such a timely consultation may have enhanced the quality of|

medical care provided to Patient A.
