4. Patient A required multi-disciplinary care during her frequent visits to St. Rose
starting on September 10, 2017, including gastroenterology and liver transplant specialty
consultations and input. During Patient A’s hospital stays between November 23, 2017, and
December 4, 2017, the care of her liver disease was directed by gastroenterology consultants at the
request of emergency room and hospitalist physicians.

5. During Patient A’s multiple emergency room visits and hospitalizations at St. Rose
between September 10, 2017, and December 11, 2017, Patient A was noted to have chronically
low sodium levels (hyponatremia) and chronically low blood pressure readings (hypotension).

6. On December 23, 2017, Patient A presented to the emergency room at St. Rose
with complaints of abdominal pain and distention. At this time, Patient A still suffered from
advanced, end-stage liver disease.

2 Patient A was then admitted to the care of Respondent in St. Rose’s observation
unit, on or about 6:01 a.m., on December 23, 2017. Respondent diagnosed Patient A as being
dehydrated with hyponatremia and having an altered mental status.

8. Upon her presentation to St. Rose on December 23, 2017, Patient A also had a new
onset of acute kidney failure, as evidenced by lab results showing low urine output and rising,
creatinine as well as impending sepsis from infection.

9. Respondent planned to rehydrate Patient A with IV fluids to correct Patient A’s
dehydration and hyponatremia but did not order or perform any other additional diagnostic tests or
therapeutic interventions to address Patient A’s acute kidney failure, or Patient A’s end-stage hver
disease with altered mental status. Respondent did not order standard coagulation tests, such as an
international normalized ratio (INR) blood test, despite Patient A’s end-stage liver disease.

10. Respondent further did not initially order or perform a small volume diagnostic
paracentesis, to rule out possible causes of Patient A’s infection, such as spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis (SBP).

11 Respondent did not request consultations with an ICU critical care physician,
nephrologist, or gastroenterologist on December 23, 2017, or December 24, 2017.

12. During Patient A’s presentation to St. Rose on December 23, 2017, Patient A also
had a high bilirubin level of 5, which would have produced obvious jaundice of the skin and
yellowing of the eyes (scleral icterus). Respondent's notes regarding Patient A did not mention
jaundice or scleral icterus. Respondent's notes further did not mention abdominal tendemess or
distension.

13. During Patient A’s stay at St. Rose starting on December 23, 2017, her urine output
remained negligible, and her creatinine climbed from 1.9 on admission to 2.75 after use of IV
fluids, suggesting hepatorenal syndrome as a probable cause of her kidney failure.

14. Despite the implementation of IV fluids, Patient A’s urine output, blood pressure
level, and creatinine level did not improve during her stay at St. Rose.

1S. Patient A also had persistent hypotension that required pressor blood pressure
support in the ICU.

16. By noon on December 24, 2017, Patient A developed a severe metabolic acidosis
(buildup of acid in the body due to kidney disease or kidney failure), consistent with lactic
acidosis, which required an ICU level of care.

17. Despite Patient A’s new onset acute kidney failure, impending sepsis, and liver
failure, Respondent opted to keep Patient A on observation status, rather than transferring,
Patient A to a higher level of care, such as the ICU.

18. Respondent's progress notes on the evening of December 24, 2017, indicated that
“patient states is getting better” and “no new issues reported.” Respondent’s reports and physical
exam at the time documented no abnormalities.

19. On December 24, 2017, after Respondent’s examination of Patient A, Patient A
became unresponsive, and a medical emergency rapid response was called. Patient A was then
transferred to the ICU, where her clinical condition continued to deteriorate with worsening septic
shock, renal failure, and developing disseminated intravascular coagulation.

20. Patient A had remained in her ER room and the observation unit for approximately
thirty (30) hours under Respondent's care before being transferred to the ICU by other responding
physicians.

to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A. Respondent failed to assess multiple important
diagnoses, including hepatorenal syndrome and septic shock, and failed to order laboratory tests,
including an INR, lactic acid, and an analysis of Patient A’s ascites fluid to look for SBP.
Respondent further failed to act in a timely fashion to Patient A’s hypotension, septic shock,
worsening acute kidney failure, and worsening metabolic acidosis, including failing to timely
transfer Patient A to a higher level of care, such as the ICU.

29. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of|
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

30. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition on December 23 and 24, 2017, and Respondent should have consulted with a
gastroenterologist or a nephrologist to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s
medical condition and such a timely consultation would have confirmed or denied such a
diagnosis and may have enhanced the quality of medical care provided to Patient A.

provided in NRS 630.352.

and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

34. Respondent failed to maintain complete and proper medical records relating to the
diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to document his actions when he treated
Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete. Respondent
failed to accurately document Patient A’s condition, including documenting “no abnormalities”
during a physical examination of Patient A on December 24, 2017, and failing to note in Patient A
jaundice, scleral icterus, abdominal tendemess, or distension.

35. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
