COMPLAIi

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Ian J. Cumings, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having
a reasonable basis to believe that Sheldon W. Paul, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of|
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 9007). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 1, 1999. Respondent’s specialty is listed as obstetrics and
gynecology on the Board’s website.

2. Patient A? was a thirty-nine (39) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. Patient A’s relevant medical history at the time of the events at issue included a
history of miscarriages and a diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Patient A delayed cancer treatment to
avoid a further delay in conception.

4. Patient A became pregnant in sometime in August with a last menstrual period of
August 5, 2021.

5. On September 15, 2021, Patient A presented to Respondent’s practice for prenatal
care at which time Patient A underwent an initial ultrasound and laboratory testing. Patient A’s
lab work showed a quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) level of 28549 which is
consistent with five (5) weeks of pregnancy.

6. On September 19, 2021, Patient A was prescribed Doxycycline to treat a suspected
infection, which is contraindicated during pregnancy, by an APRN at Respondent’ practice.

7 On September 22, 2021, Patient A returned to Respondents practice for a repeat
ultrasound. The ultrasound was interpreted by a nurse who informed Patient A that the fetus had
not grown and was not viable. Patient A was scheduled for a dilation and curettage to terminate
the pregnancy.

8. On September 29, 2021, Patient A presented to Respondent for a dilation and
curettage to terminate her pregnancy. Following the procedure, Respondent sent a blood sample
from Patient A during the procedure for laboratory testing. Testing revealed no fetal parts in the
blood sampled.

9. On October 6, 2021, Patient A presented to Respondent for a follow-up
appointment after the dilation and curettage, which the Respondent had deemed as failed. An
ultrasound was performed which Respondent documented as showing an irregular gestational sac
with no fetal pole or yolk sac. Respondent maintained the diagnosis that the fetus was nonviable
and prescribed Patient A the medication Cytotec to induce an abortion, which is also
contraindicated during pregnancy.

10. On October 6, 2021, Patient A presented to the emergency department at a local
hospital immediately following her appointment with Respondent. Ultrasound testing at the
hospital revealed a viable intrauterine pregnancy with an estimated gestational age of eight (8)
weeks and one (1) day.

11. Patient A subsequently continued on to deliver her pregnancy on April 24, 2021.
