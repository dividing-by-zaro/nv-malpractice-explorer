The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Brandee Mooneyhan, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an

(50) years old on June 16, 2017.7

with a chief complaint of a lump in her right breast that had been present for at least three (3)

4, A diagnostic mammogram’ is required to evaluate a palpable mass in the breast of
a 50-year-old patient, such as Patient A. See American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists (ACOG), Practice Bulletin No. 164, Diagnosis and Management of Benign Breast
Disorders (June 2016) (“For women 30 years or older with a palpable mass, diagnostic
mammography should be obtained, and additional imaging with ultrasonography often is required.
(emphasis added)); American College of Radiology (ACR), “ACR Appropriateness Criteria —
Palpable Breast Masses,” in 14 Journal of the American College of Radiology No. 55 (May 2017)
(“Diagnostic mammography is indicated for women greater than or equal to 40 years presenting
with a palpable lump.”)

5. While an ultrasound’ of the breast may be appropriate for supplemental evaluation
of a palpable mass in the breast of a 50-year-old patient such as Patient A, it should not be the
only imaging ordered for such a patient. See ACR Appropriateness Criteria — Palpable Breast
Masses (“[Ultrasound] is an essential next step in evaluating women >40 years with a palpable
mass ....”; however, “[ultrasound] can be used as the initial means of image evaluation for
women aged 30 to 39 years with a palpable breast mass, although diagnostic mammography or
[digital breast tomosynthesis] may also be appropriate in this age group.”).

6. In order to evaluate the lump in Patient A’s right breast, Respondent ordered an
ultrasound, but did not order a diagnostic mammogram.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice
7. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

reference as though fully set forth herein.

3 “A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast.” See National Library of Medicine, Medline Plus,
https://medlineplus.gov/mammography.html (last visited June 12, 2023). “A diagnostic mammogram is done for
people who have a lump or other signs or symptoms of breast cancer.” /d. While the same machine is uses for
screening and diagnostic mammograms, “diagnostic mammography takes longer to perform than screening
mammography and the total dose of radiation is higher because more x-ray images are needed to obtain views of the
breast from several angles.” See National Cancer Institute, https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/mammograms-fact-
sheet (last visited June 12, 2023).

4 “Breast ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves to examine the breasts.” See National Library of

Medicine, Medline Plus, https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003379.htm (last visited June 12, 2023).

care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when rendering medical
services to Patient A.

provided in NRS 630.352.
