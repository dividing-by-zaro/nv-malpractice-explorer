The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

COMPLAINT

(Board), by and through Ian J. Cumings, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having
a reasonable basis to believe that Wa’el Hisham Milyani, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating
the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1, Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 17362). Respondent was

originally licensed by the Board on August 25, 2017, with dermatopathology listed as his

specialty.
2. Patient A* was a seventeen (17) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.
3. On January 19, 2018, Patient A underwent an inguinal lymph node biopsy to

examine abnormal growth of her lymph nodes. An intact 3.7 cm inguinal lymph node was

sampled and tested.


1 The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Victor M. Muro, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ashan,
M.D., Ph.D., FACC, and Ms. Pamela Beal.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4, On January 23, 2018, test results were erroneously interpreted by Respondent as
benign reactive lymph node tissue.

5. On June 13, 2018, at the request of Patient A’s primary care provider due to
persistent symptomology, another pathologist reviewed the original materials and tests from the
biopsy which had occurred from January 19, 2018. Upon review, it was determined the sampled
inguinal lymph node showed evidence of Hodgkin Lymphoma and the case was referred for
additional consultation.

6. On June 19, 2018, Pathologists at UCLA confirmed a diagnosis of Stage 2 Hodgkin
Lymphoma of mixed cell types.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

7. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

8. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a Physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

9. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

10. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A by failing to identify concerning pathology present in
Patient A’s biopsy and thereby delaying her diagnosis and treatment.

11. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT I
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation —
Failure to Consult

12. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein. |

13. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

14. | NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

15. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition on January 23, 2018. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care
provider to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition and such a
timely consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and may have enhanced the
quality of medical care provided to Patient A regarding a diagnosis of Hodgkin Lymphoma.

16. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
6. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these

premises.
