4. In pertinent part, the Pharmacy Board Accusation alleged that Respondent
prescribed Edarbyclor, a dangerous drug, to a patient, and that the patient subsequently returned
the unused medication to Respondent. The Pharmacy Board Accusation further alleged that
Respondent then dispensed the unused Edarbyclor to another patient, in the original container with
the original label as dispensed to the first patient. The Pharmacy Board further alleged that
Respondent dispensed this medication without a valid dispensing practitioner registration.

5. On or about October 15, 2021, Respondent and the Pharmacy Board entered into a
“Stipulation and Order” (Pharmacy Board Stipulation), hereto attached as Exhibit 1, whereby
Respondent did not contest the allegations in the Accusation and acknowledged that counsel for
the Pharmacy Board “could present such evidence at an administrative hearing to establish a
factual basis” for violations against him.

6. Respondent accepted the Pharmacy Board Stipulation “as a public reprimand
regarding his duties and responsibilities as a prescribing practitioner,” and agreed to pay a fine and
also to reimburse the Pharmacy Board for a portion of the costs incurred in investigating and
prosecuting the matter.
