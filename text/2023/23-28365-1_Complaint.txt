4 On or about February 7, 2015, at 11:00 a.m., Respondent examined Patient A and
noted an unremarkable exam but failed to address Patient A’s tachycardic heart rate of 112. By
5:20 p.m., Patient A’s vital signs worsened which included a white blood cell count of 2.7, an
increased heart rate of 117 and a low blood pressure reading of 84/49 all of which indicated a
likelihood of an onset of sepsis.

5. Patient A was transferred to the intensive care unit and her condition deteriorated
rapidly. Patient A suffered respiratory distress and cardiac arrest which required intubation and
pressors to maintain her blood pressure.

6. On or about February 8, 2015, a computed tomography (CT) scan of Patient A’s
abdomen was obtained which revealed fluid and free air at the surgery site, indicating post-
surgical changes and likely a perforation of her digestive system. Respondent examined the
patient but failed to recognize or document a cause of Patient A’s sepsis or the possibility of post-
surgical complications.

7. From on or about February 9, 2015, until on or about February 16, 2015,
Respondent continued to document examinations of the patient but failed to mention any post
surgical complications or sepsis, and did not order additional diagnostic imaging.

8 Onor about February 17, 2015, another physician ordered an abdominal CT due to
Patient A’s worsening white blood cell count of 20.1 and deteriorating condition. The CT
demonstrated mediastinal air and fluid collection which confirmed perforation of the patient’s
esophagus or stomach. Respondent documented the concerning CT findings in the medical record
and ordered a Gastrografin upper gastrointestinal series which confirmed gastric perforation.

9. Onor about February 17, 2015, Respondent performed an exploratory laparotomy
and gastric perforation repair, a full ten (10) days after Patient A’s respiratory failure and cardiac
arrest.

10. Patient A’s post-operative course was difficult, requiring a third procedure on or
about March 9, 2015. Ultimately Patient A suffered significant complications with a loss of blood
to her extremities resulting in the amputation of Patient A’s feet, and multiple infections.
