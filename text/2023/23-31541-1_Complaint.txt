Against: FI LE D

BABUK GHUMAN, M.D.,
SEP - 6 2023

NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
5 MEDICAL EXAMINER,

Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Babuk Ghuman, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 11864). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on June 1, 2006. Respondent’s specialty is listed as
anesthesiology and pain management on the Board’s website.

2. Patient A? was a thirty-seven (37) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On March 14, 2018, in order to treat Patient A’s persistent neck and arm pain,
Respondent performed left selective nerve root blocks at the C5, C6, and C7 levels of Patient A’s
cervical vertebrae, by administering epidural steroid injections with a transforaminal approach.


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Col. Eric D. Wade,
USAF, (Ret.), and Carl N. Williams, Jr., M.D., FACS.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4. Respondent chose to perform a transforaminal epidural steroid injection as a first-
line interventional treatment, despite a greater risk of complications and morbidity associated with
the transforaminal approach as opposed to the translaminar approach.

5. Prior to the March 14, 2018, procedure, Patient A signed a Consent to Surgical or
Diagnostic Procedure form (consent form) to receive the left selective nerve root blocks at the C5,
C6, and C7 levels of Patient A’s cervical vertebrae. This consent form, however, did not describe
the risks associated with selective nerve root block procedures, or that Patient A had the option to
use translaminar cervical epidural injections instead of transforaminal epidural injections.

6. Immediately following the March 14, 2018, nerve block procedure, Patient A
developed complications, including severe burning pain below her left armpit area, paralysis of
the left side of her face, arm, and leg, and decreased lacrimation and ptosis of her left eye.

7. Patient A was also later diagnosed with a spinal cord hemorrhage as a result of the
March 14, 2018 procedure.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

9. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

10. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

ll. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A on March 14, 2018, by using transforaminal epidural
steroid injections as a first-line interventional treatment, as opposed to translaminar epidural
steroid injections, despite the greater risk of complications and morbidity associated with the

transforaminal approach as opposed to the translaminar approach.
