ORDER OF SUSPENSION AND NOTICE OF HEARING

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board) hereby IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDS the license of Samuel Rodolfo Chacon, M.D.
(Respondent) from the practice of medicine, pursuant to the Board’s authority to regulate the
practice of medicine in the State of Nevada pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS)
Chapter 630

The IC issues this Order of Suspension (Order) based on its determination that
Respondent’s acts place the health, safety, or welfare of the public at risk of imminent harm
pursuant to NRS 630.326(1).

Prior to the preparation of this Order, Board Staff presented to the IC the following

1. Respondent is a medical doctor licensed to practice medicine in the State of
Nevada (License No. 9105). Respondent was originally licensed by the Board on July 27, 1999,
with a specialty listed as Obstetrics/Gynecology since 2003.

2. On November 22, 2022, Respondent lost his hospital privileges at Renown
Regional Medical Center (Renown) following a voluntary surrender of his clinical privileges

while under, or to avoid, an investigation relating to his professional competence or conduct.

3 Following Respondent’s November 22, 2022, surrender of hospital privileges at
Renown, Respondent held no hospital privileges, and therefore could not deliver any of his
prenatal patients.

4. Patient A? was a prenatal patient of Respondent when he surrendered his hospital
privileges at Renown.

= On September 8, 2022, Patient A was diagnosed with a twin pregnancy. Patient
A’s pregnancy was classified as high-risk due to her twin pregnancy and gestational diabetes.

6. From October 26, 2022, until March 30, 2023, Patient A was seen by a high-risk
pregnancy specialist on no less than five (5) occasions for high-risk pregnancy and prenatal care
including performance of ultrasounds. Due to the fetal growth restriction of Twin A, Patient A
was recommended by the high-risk pregnancy specialist to be induced between thirty-six (36)
weeks and thirty-six weeks and three days (36.3) weeks gestation.

7. Despite Patient A’s classification as a high-risk pregnancy, Respondent failed to
refer her to an appropriate care provider who could deliver Patient A, nor did he make
arrangements with another physician group who could assume the prenatal care of Patient A for
delivery services.

8. On March 31, 2023, Respondent, unable to induce labor or deliver Patient A,
instructed her to present to the emergency department at Renown when she went into labor, This
resulted in exposure of Patient A and her twin children to unnecessary danger and great risk of
harm, as Patient A would not be induced as recommended by the high-risk pregnancy specialist.

9. Board investigations reveal that Respondent is continuing to offer prenatal care to
other established patients and advertise for and accept new prenatal patients, despite his lack of
hospital privileges and his inability to deliver his patients, and without any relationship with
another provider or practice group to whom he could transfer his patients for delivery services.

10. Based on the foregoing, the IC finds that the health, safety, and welfare of the
Respondent’s patients and the public are at imminent risk of harm if Respondent is permitted to

continue practicing medicine, and that an immediate suspension of Respondent’s license to

? Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation
served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Order.
