MED) MINERS
By:

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Deb Kumar Mukhopadhyay, M.D., (Respondent) violated
the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the
IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 9249). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on December 17, 1999.

2. Patient A? was a seventy-two (72) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On or about August 16, 2018, Patient A presented to Mountain View Hospital with
complaints of feeling dehydrated and weak.

4. After arriving at Mountain View Hospital, Patient A was diagnosed with massive
recurrence of oral tongue cancer extending to the area of the vocal cords, associated with the

inability to swallow.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Chair, Aury Nagy,
M.D., and Michael C. Edwards, M.D., FACS.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

15,

5. While at Mountain View Hospital, Patient A’s oncologist planned for
chemotherapy and placement of a gastrostomy tube to bring medication and nutrition directly to
Patient A’s stomach, among other care measures.

6. On August 17, 2018, while at Mountain View Hospital, Respondent conducted a
gastroenterologist consultation with Patient A. Respondent chose to perform a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement by passing an adult gastroscope from Patient A’s
mouth to her stomach, instead of attempting a tracheostomy. The PEG tube placement was
scheduled for August 18, 2018.

7. Respondent’s notes and records do not show that Respondent conducted an oral
examination of Patient A to assess the feasibility of using a gastroscope for the PEG tube
placement.

8. Patient A’s medical records, which were available to Respondent prior to the PEG
tube placement, indicated that use of a gastroscope could be unsafe, due to Patient A’s condition,
including an x-ray report signed and dated on August 16, 2018, showed thickening in Patient A’s
throat area, suggesting either epiglottitis or angioedema.

9. Respondent’s notes and records do not show that Respondent reviewed the
August 16, 2018 x-ray report nor discussed the results with Patient A.

10. Respondent’s notes and records further do not show that Respondent shared
decision making regarding Patient A’s care with Patient A, by explaining surgical alternatives
open to Patient A, along with their risks and benefits, or that Respondent and Patient A agreed on
a thoroughly discussed treatment plan.

11. | Respondent’s notes and records do not show that Respondent advised the
anesthesiologist for the PEG tube placement of any obstructions in Patient A’s mouth and throat
that would have made Patient A’s airway vulnerable.

12. On August 18, 2018, at Mountain View Hospital, Respondent attempted placement
of the PEG tube with anesthesia.

13. During the PEG tube placement procedure, Respondent could not pass the adult

gastroscopy over Patient A’s tongue due to lack of room. Respondent decided to change the scope

from adult gastroscope to pediatric gastroscope. Patient A then developed low blood oxygen
levels and stopped breathing. Patient A suffered cardiac arrest.

14. The attending anesthesiologist attempted intubation but was unsuccessful. A rapid
response team was called, who then attempted full CPR, ventilation, and pharmacologic
intervention. Patient A was then resuscitated.

15. Hospital surgeons then placed an emergent tracheostomy due to the inability to
establish an oral airway with Patient A.

16. Patient A was then transferred to the ICU in an unstable condition, where she
eventually was stabilized.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

17. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

18. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

19. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

20. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, by (1) not being aware of Patient A’s significant oral
obstruction which would have made the PEG placement impossible; and (2) not advising the
anesthesiologist for the August 18, 2018 procedure of the obstruction that would have made
Patient A’s airway vulnerable.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

22. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

23. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

24. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions when he treated
Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete by (1) not
documenting an oral examination of Patient A on or about August 18, 2018, to assess the
feasibility of gastroscopy; (2) not documenting review of the August 16, 2018 x-ray report; and
(3) not documenting that Respondent shared decision making regarding treatment with Patient A
on or about August 18, 2018, by explaining the alternatives open to Patient A and agreeing on a
thoroughly discussed plan.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;
