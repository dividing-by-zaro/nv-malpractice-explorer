In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 23-35041-2

Against: FILED

YEVGENIY ANATOLIY KHAVKIN, M.D., JUL 28 2023

Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Brandee Mooneyhan, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Yevgeniy Anatoliy Khavkin, M.D., (Respondent) violated
the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the
IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 13271). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on August 26, 2009, and specializes in neurological surgery.

2. Patient A? was a forty-six (46) year-old female with a history of neck and lower
back pain when the events described below began.

3. Patient A was referred by her primary care physician to Respondent for
consultation regarding her pain, and Patient A first presented to Respondent’s clinic on
November 24, 2020 (first encounter).


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., (Chair),
Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.) (Public Member), and Carl N. Williams, Jr., M.D., FACS.

? Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4. Respondent’s record of the first encounter indicates that Patient A “ha[d] been
through extensive conservative treatment without significant improvement of her symptoms.”
The next line states: “Conservative treatment[:] no pain management; no physical therapy; no
neurology services[.]” The record does not document other “extensive conservative treatment”
allegedly taken by Patient A.

5. The record further indicates that during the first encounter, Respondent reviewed
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of Patient A’s lumbar spine that had been taken on
October 9, 2020.

6. In pertinent part, the radiologist who performed the MRI of Patient A’s lumbar
spine found mild-to-moderate facet arthrosis and foraminal narrowing? in the lumbar segments

between Patient A’s L4 and LS vertebrae (L4-5)*:

L4-5: Small broad-based posterior central disk protrusion-annular
fissure with anterior/posterior disk osteophyte complex. Mild-
moderate facet arthrosis. Thecal sac is mildly narrowed measuring
8.6-8.8 mm. Slight lateral recess narrowing. Mild-moderate
bilateral foraminal narrowing.

In contrast, the radiologist found that the vertebral segment between Patient A’s L3 and L4

vertebrae (L3-4) had only mild facet arthrosis and normal foramina:

L3-L4: Disk bulge with endplate osteophyte versus protrusion.
Mild facet arthrosis. No significant spinal canal stenosis. Foramina
are lower limits of normal.

The radiologist recorded his overall impression regarding Patient A’s spine as:

1. Mild scoliosis, degenerative spondylosis, and facet arthrosis
throughout the lumbar spine. Very small disk protrusions and/or
disk bulging from L2-L3 through L5-S1.

2. L4-LS: Mild spinal canal stenosis and mild-to-moderate bilateral
foraminal narrowing.

3 “[NJarrowing of the openings (called neural foramina) where spinal nerves leave the spinal column” is also
called “spinal stenosis,” and such “narrowing puts pressure on [the] nerves and spinal cord and can cause pain.” See
“Spinal stenosis,”Medical Encyclopedia, https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000441 .htm (ast visited July 27, 2023);
“Spinal Stenosis,” Health Topics, https://medlineplus.gov/spinalstenosis.html (last visited July 27, 2023).

4 “There are three main groups of vertebrae—the cervical vertebrae atop the spinal column, of which there
are seven; the thoracic vertebrae, situated below the cervical vertebrae, of which there are twelve; and the lumbar
vertebrae situated below the thoracic vertebrae, of which there are five. The letters ‘C,’ ‘T,’ and ‘L’ are used
respectively to designate cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. The sacrum is located at the base of the spinal
column and below it, the coccyx or ‘tailbone.’ The five sacral and four coccygeal vertebrae are fused and together are
considered one bone.” Mousseau v. Schwartz, 756 N.W.2d 345, 347 n.2 (S.D. 2008).

3. Other levels: no significantly spinal canal or foraminal
narrowing.

4. No abnormal enhancement/mass.

5. No abnormal signal in the cord.

7. Respondent’s record of the first encounter reflects that Respondent believed that
only Patient A’s L4-5 lumbar segment required surgical attention. Respondent recorded his
interpretation of the October 9, 2020, MRI as “show[ing] evidence of degenerative changes at the
L4 L5 level with a central and foraminal stenosis and the loss of the disc height,” and that he
recommended “proceeding with surgical treatment consisting of the L4-L5 lumber decompression
and fusion”’ to treat Patient A’s lower back pain.

8. Patient A had another visit with Respondent on January 26, 2021, for a
preoperative consultation. Respondent’s record of the preoperative consultation states that Patient
A was “[s]cheduled TLIF!! L4-L5 01/29/2021.” A narrative under the heading “Plan” stated:
“We will proceed with the previously discussed L4-L5 TLIF.”

9. On the “Surgery & Procedure Scheduling Form/Physician Pre-Operative
Admission Orders” regarding the procedure, which appears to have been signed by Respondent
and transmitted to the hospital on or about January 20, 2021, in the space for “Procedure as it is to
appear on the Consent,” was entered: “Lumbar Decompression and Fusion from Lumbar Four to
Lumbar 5.”

10. On January 29, 2021, Patient A presented to Spring Valley Hospital Medical
Center for the planned transforaminal lumber interbody fusion with decompression at her L4-5
vertebral segment.

ll. | The “Consent to Surgery and Other Invasive Procedures” regarding the planned
procedure, which was signed and dated on the morning of January 29, 2021, indicates that


5 In the context of spinal surgery, decompression refers to the surgical relief of pressure on the spinal cord or
nerves. “To accomplish the fusion during [transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion] surgery, two rods are placed
lengthwise on either side of the spine and attached with screws into the pedicle bones of the spine. This bracing
provides stability, while a small metal cage with bone-growth material is placed between the vertebra to facilitate new
bone growth and fusion of the spine.” Knight v. Clark, 283 So. 3d 1111, 1124 (Miss. Ct. App. 2019) (Westbrooks, J.,
dissenting) (internal footnotes omitted).

6 In this context, “TLIF” means transforaminal interbody lumbar fusion.

Patient A authorized Respondent to perform “Lumbar decompression and fusion from lumbar four
to lumbar five.”

12. The “Pre-Procedure Verification” form regarding Patient A’s surgery, signed and
dated the morning of January 29, 2021, states that the procedure for which Patient A had reported
to the hospital was: “LUMBAR DECOMPRESSION AND FUSION FROM LUMBAR FOUR
TO LUMBAR FIVE.”

13. As set forth above, the preoperative records regarding Patient A’s
January 29, 2021, surgery indicate that only the L4-5 segment of Patient A’s spine was to be
operated upon; there is no indication that any other spinal segment was a candidate for surgery.

14. During the January 29, 2021, surgery, in addition to performing the planned
procedure at the L4-5 segment, Respondent operated on the L3-4 segment of
Patient A’s spine.

15. In his operative report of the January 29, 2021, surgery, Respondent stated that he

made an intraoperative decision to extend the surgery to the L3-4 segment:

The L3-L4 segment was examined and appeared to be grossly
unstable with a significant amount of abnormal motion present at
this level. Per my previous discussion with the patient and to
accomplish better clinical outcomes and prevent neurological
deficit, it was decided to incorporate the L3-L4 segment into the
construct and the Precision pedicle screws were placed at the L3,
L4 and LS levels bilaterally.

16. Respondent failed to explain in his operative report why the L3-4 segment was
“examined” in the midst of the surgery when the preoperative MRI indicated that it did not require
surgery.

17. Neither did Respondent explain how Patient A’s L3-4 segment was “examined” in
the midst of the surgery, when mere appearance of the segment would be insufficient to
demonstrate instability and physical manipulation of the segment would be unwarranted.

18. Nor did Respondent explain what criteria he used to determine that the L3-4
segment was “grossly unstable” or provide any objective measurement of its alleged instability.

19. A neurosurgeon would not ordinarily “examine” the stability of a spinal segment
during a surgery being performed on other spinal segments, and the “appearance” of a spinal
segment is not sufficient to support a clinical determination regarding its stability.

20. Respondent’s statement in his operative report that Patient A’s L3-4 segment was
“examined” in the midst of surgery and “appeared to be grossly unstable with significant amount
of abnormal motion present” is not sufficient justification for a reasonable neurosurgeon to
incorporate that segment into a fusion construct.

21. Respondent operated on the L3-4 segment of Patient A’s spine in the absence of
sufficient evidence that such a procedure was medically necessary or advantageous to Patient A.

22. A neurosurgeon exercising the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
in performing spinal surgery would not fuse the L3-4 segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine in the
absence of sufficient evidence that it was medically necessary or advantageous to do so.

23. In agreeing to allow Respondent to operate on her spine, Patient A placed her trust
in Respondent to perform the procedure he represented he would and to exercise appropriate care
of Patient A during the planned surgery.

24, Respondent’s extension of the planned surgery to include fusion of the L3-4
segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine was completed while Patient A was unconscious and thus
exceedingly vulnerable.

25. Fusing an additional segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine, and correspondingly
increasing the spinal hardware used during the spinal surgery, increased the amount Respondent
would be paid for performing the surgery.

28. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

29. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when, during Patient A’s spinal surgery on January 29, 2021, he
fused the L3-4 segment of Patient A’s spine without sufficient evidence that it was medically
necessary to do so.

30. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.301(7) — Engaging in Conduct That Violates the Trust of a Patient and Exploits
the Relationship with the Patient for Financial or Other Personal Gain

32. | NRS 630.301(7) provides that “engaging in conduct that violates the trust of the
patient and exploits the relationship between the physician and the patient for financial or other
personal gain” constitutes grounds for initiating discipline against a physician.

33. Respondent engaged in conduct that violated Patient A’s trust and exploited his
relationship with Patient A to realize a financial or other personal gain by unnecessarily fusing
Patient A’s L3-4 lumbar segment in the midst of surgery planned for another spinal segment on
January 29, 2021, thereby increasing the cost of the surgery and his corresponding compensation.

34. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

36. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

37. Respondent failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A when he failed to include adequate detail in his
operative report of Patient A’s January 29, 2021, spinal surgery as to: (1) why he examined the
L3-4 vertebral segment when preoperative imaging showed it did not require surgery; (2) how he
examined the L3-4 vertebral segment; (3) what criteria he used to determine the L3-4 vertebral
segment was “grossly unstable”; and (4) any objective measurement of the alleged instability of
the L3-4 vertebral segment.

38. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IV
NRS 630.301(9) — Disreputable Conduct

41. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, by performing an
unnecessary surgical procedure and violating Patient A’s trust and exploiting his relationship with
Patient A in order to realize a financial or other personal gain, Respondent engaged in conduct that
brings the medical profession into disrepute.

42. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
