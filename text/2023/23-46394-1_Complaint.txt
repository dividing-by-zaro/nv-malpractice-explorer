of hip pain following a fall.

4. An X-ray was ordered and interpreted by radiology who entered the report into
Patient A’s medical records at 1600 hours.

5. Radiology determined that Patient A had an “acute periprosthetic fracture adjacent

to the total left hip arthroplasty hardware. The fracture is longitudinal oblique with mild

displacement.”
6. On the same day, Patient A was discharged home at 1701 hours.
7. Respondent wrote in her Supervising Physician Note in-part: “I have personally

seen the patient, performed the critical or key portions of the service, and participated in the
management of the patient. I have reviewed and agree with the resident’s note, and I have
reviewed all labs and imaging studies or reports.” The note goes on to say, “ground level fall with
leg pain. No syncope. Nontoxic appearing, no deformity. XR with no bony injury. Pt feels better
and desires to go home, will prescribe muscle relaxer and have pt FU with PCP. Return
precautions given.”

8. Respondent electronically signed her note on November 10, 2018, at 2104 hours.

9. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

radiology.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
