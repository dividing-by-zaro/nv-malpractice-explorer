September 12, 2016, wherein she complained of chronic pain.

5. Patient A was already taking 30 mg of oxycodone and 350 mg of carisoprodol for

on or about November 10, 2016, and on or about December 19, 2016.

fails to justify the continued prescriptions for high doses of opioids, nor did he create a plan to
investigate the cause of Patient A’s chronic pain.

Patient A’s records from previous providers.

9. Respondent’s documentation does not reflect that he utilized imaging studies to
determine the cause of Patient A’s chronic pain.

10. Respondent's documentation does not reflect that he attempted to utilize alternative
treatment (non-opioid) for Patient A’s chronic pain.

11. Respondent’s documentation indicates, “drug screen appropriate for meds
prescribed,” but test results are not included in the records for Patient A.

opioids were clinically indicated and to determine the risks associated with their use in a particular
individual with pain with regard to Patient A’s medical care.

medications that have the strong potential for misuse.

14, Respondent provided inadequate attention to patient education and informed
consent for Patient A’s medical care.

of the potential risks or alternative treatments.
