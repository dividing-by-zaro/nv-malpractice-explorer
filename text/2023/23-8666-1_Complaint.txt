Against: FI LE D

MICHAEL SCOTT MALL, M.D.,

NEVADA YARD OF
MEDI INERS
By:

Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Donald K. White, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Michael Scott Mall, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 6074). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 1, 1990.

2. Patient A? was a forty-nine (49) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. Patient A presented for consultation for laser treatment of a scar on her chest on or
about August 21, 2019, and was given a consent form.

4. Respondent’s notes and records for this visit show that Respondent did not
document Patient A’s history, nor did he document that he had reviewed her history or any intake

forms.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Carl N. Williams, Jr.,
M.D., FACS and Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.).

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. Respondent did document at this visit that Patient A had a raised scar on her upper
chest, however some of the handwritten notes are illegible and it appears Respondent failed to
acknowledge whether the scarring was hypertrophic, keloid or another type of scarring. Both
hypertrophic and keloid scarring are contraindicated for aggressive CO2 resurfacing, which
Respondent also failed to document or take into consideration prior to treating Patient A.

6. On or about August 28, 2019, Patient A received treatment with the use of an
Accupulse CO2 fractional resurfacing laser. During the procedure, Patient A felt more pain than
she expected to and believed the area being treated was larger than the area that she had consented
to be treated. Later that same day, Patient A developed blisters on her skin at the treated area and
texted Respondent about the blisters. Respondent replied the blisters were normal and part of
healing.

7. In review of the medical records for the August 28, 2019 treatment, Respondent
failed to document the amount of time of the treatment, the intensity of the laser setting, and the
number of passes for each area treated. Additionally, and according to Respondent, he would
routinely use the same intensity settings on the laser during the entirety of the treatment,
regardless of different body parts.

8. Respondent did not follow-up with Patient A after two (2) weeks post-treatment, so
Patient A called Respondent’s office to schedule a follow-up appointment.

9. On or about September 16, 2019, Patient A presented for her follow-up
appointment at Respondent’s office concerned that she was not healing properly and had a grid
pattern on her chest. Respondent assured Patient A that her experience and healing were normal,
eighteen (18) days post-procedure.

10. Patient A did not agree with Respondent and did not return for care from
Respondent. On October 1, 2019, Patient A noticed elevated scarring at the treatment site and
chose to see another medical provider for her aftercare.

circumstances.”

14, As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A when he failed to document Patient A’s history of
previous scarring or document that he discussed risk factors, such as possible scarring from CO2
treatment; when he unnecessarily treated a larger area than what Patient A consented to; when he
failed to document the amount of time he used the laser during treatment; the intensity of the laser
setting, and the number of passes for each area treated; when he was unable to recognize the
severe side effects of the laser treatment, such as Patient A’s blistering, and failed to refer her to a
dermatologist in a timely manner; and according to Respondent, routinely used the same intensity
for all body parts.

18. | Respondent failed to maintain legible, accurate, and complete medical records
relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document
Patient A’s history and risk factors; by his lack of review of any intake forms; by failing to
document the amount of time the laser was used during treatment or intensity of the laser setting,
as well as the number of passes for each area treated; and by failing to document Patient A’s
severe side effects from the laser treatment, such as blistering. Further, Respondent’s consent
form was incomplete, as it did not outline the three (3) of the most common side effects of CO2
laser treatment, including but not limited to scarring, infection, and pigmentation changes.

19. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT Ii
NRS 630.306(1)(p) - Unsafe or Unprofessional Conduct

20. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set
forth herein.

methods of diagnosis ordinarily utilized by physicians in good
standing practicing in the same specialty or field. The assessment
may include nonconventional methods of diagnosis. The
assessment must include the following:
1. An adequate medical record.
2. Documentation as to whether conventional treatment options,
including, without limitation, referral options for conventional
treatment, ordinarily utilized by physicians in good standing
practicing in the same specialty or field have been:

(a) Discussed with the patient;

(b) Offered to the patient;

(c) Refused by the patient; or

(d) Undertaken with the patient and, if so, the outcome of

the treatment.

23. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to document Patient A’s previous history of scarring or document that he discussed risk factors,
such as possible scarring from CO2 laser treatment. Moreover, Respondent’s consent form was
incomplete, as it did not outline the three (3) most common side effects of CO2 laser treatment,
including, but not limited to, scarring, infection, and pigmentation changes. Respondent’s conduct
was unsafe and unprofessional.

24. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IV
NRS 630.306(1)(e) - Practice Beyond Scope of License

25. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

26. NRS 630.306(1)(e) provides that practicing or offering to practice beyond the
scope permitted by law or performing services which the licensee knows or has reason to know
that he or she is not competent to perform, or which are beyond the scope of his or her training,
constitutes grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

27.  Accupulse CO2 fractional resurfacing requires training and experience to gain
competence to provide adequate medical care and ensure the safety of patients. As demonstrated
by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed to document Patient A’s history
of previous scarring or document that he discussed risk factors, such as possible additional
scarring from CO2 laser treatment. Due to Respondent’s lack of training and experience in the
area of dermatology and skin treatments, he unnecessarily treated a larger area than what Patient
A consented to; failed to document the amount of time, the intensity of the laser setting, and the
number of passes for each area treated. Further, he was unable to recognize the severe side effects
of the laser treatment in the patient’s follow-up appointment including Patient A’s blistering, and
therefore failed to refer her to an experienced dermatologist in a timely manner; and, according to
Respondent, routinely used the same intensity for all body parts, thereby underscoring that he was

practicing beyond the scope of his license.
