Against: FILED

Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
MEDI IINERS
By:

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Ira Alan Klein, M.D., (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 16161). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on October 13, 2015.

2. Patient A? was a seventy-two (72) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On or about August 16, 2018, Patient A presented to Mountain View Hospital with
complaints of feeling dehydrated and weak.

4. After arriving at Mountain View Hospital, Patient A was diagnosed with massive
recurrence of oral tongue cancer extending to the area of the vocal cords, associated with the

inability to swallow.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Chair, Aury Nagy,
M.D., and Michael C. Edwards, M.D., FACS.

? Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. While at Mountain View Hospital, the medical professionals caring for Patient A
determined that Patient A should undergo a diagnostic endoscopic procedure and placement of a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, to allow access for medication and nutrition.
These procedures were scheduled for August 18, 2018.

6. Respondent was the anesthesiologist for Patient A’s August 18, 2018, diagnostic
endoscopic procedure and PEG tube placement.

7. Patient A’s medical notes and records, which were available to Respondent prior to
the diagnostic endoscopic procedure and PEG tube placement procedure, indicated possible
airway management difficulties and difficulty with intubation, including an x-ray report signed
and dated on August 16, 2018, showed thickening in Patient A’s throat area, suggesting either
epiglottitis or angioedema.

8. Respondent’s pre-operative assessment of Patient A did not adequately address the
anticipated airway difficulties consistent with possible epiglottitis or angioedema.

9. The PEG placement procedure on August 18, 2018, took place in the endoscopy
suite at Mountain View Hospital, instead of the operating room. Respondent did not follow an
epiglottitis or angioedema protocol by not having the procedure performed in an operating room
with a surgeon and staff available for a surgical airway.

10. During the August 18, 2018, procedure Respondent provided monitored anesthesia
care to Patient A. Respondent sedated Patient A with 2 mg of Midazolam and 70 mg of Propofol
intravenously.

11. During the August 18, 2018, procedure Patient A developed low blood oxygen
levels and stopped breathing upon the admission of anesthesia. Respondent was able to oxygenate
but could not ventilate Patient A. Patient A suffered cardiac arrest.

12. A rapid response team was called, who then attempted full CPR, ventilation, and
pharmacologic intervention. Patient A was then resuscitated.

13. Respondent unsuccessfully attempted a direct laryngoscopy in order to intubate
Patient A’s trachea, but was unable to do so due to Patient A’s tumor distorting the airway and

making it impossible to visualize the larynx.

14. Surgeons were called into the procedure room, where they performed an
emergency tracheostomy on Patient A. Patient A was then transferred to the ICU in an unstable
condition, where she eventually was stabilized.

15. Respondent’s post-anesthesia assessment record indicated that there were no
complications involved with the August 18, 2018 PEG tube placement procedure.

16. Respondent further did not record any post-procedure notes regarding Patient A.

Patient A did not adequately address Patient A’s preoperative status, including anticipated airway
difficulties consistent with possible epiglottitis or angioedema; (2) Respondent did not perform the
intubation in an operating room with a surgeon and staff available for a surgical airway; and (3)
