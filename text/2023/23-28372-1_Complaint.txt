In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 23-28372-1

Against:

ZHENG KUN LIU, M.D., FILED
Respondent. JAN 36 2023

NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Ian J. Cumings, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having
a reasonable basis to believe that Zheng Kun Liu, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10712). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on November 25, 2003.

2. Patient A? was a six (6) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. On April 6, 2019, Patient A presented to an urgent care after a two-day history of
severe headaches, nausea, vomiting with blood, and lethargy. The patient did not have diarrhea,
hematemesis, head injury, or fever.


1 The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ahsan,

M.D., Ph.D, FACC, and Col. Eric D. Wade (Ret.).
2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient

Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4, Patient A was seen by Respondent, who briefly examined him and documented his
appearance as ill and lethargic. Respondent noted Patient A’s neck was supple but failed to either
perform or document a detailed examination of Patient A’s neck.

5. Respondent failed to order any diagnostic testing or perform an adequate
neurologic examination. There is no documented testing of Patient A’s gait, mental status, or
other basic components of a neurological examination.

6. Respondent made a putative diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis and prescribed
Zofran, an anti-nausea medication, and released Patient A without referring him for testing, or to a
pediatric emergency room for a higher level of care given his lethargy and clinical presentation.

7. On April 7, 2019, Patient A’s condition worsened, and he was taken to the pediatric
emergency department, where within an hour, he was diagnosed as having meningitis. During
Patient A’s hospital course, he required ventilation for ten (10) days, and suffered small strokes as
a complication of his brain edema. As a result, Patient A was left with a difficult gait, seizures,
and permanent deafness.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

9. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a Physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

10. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

11. | As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A. Respondent failed to identify clear signs of meningitis in
a six-year-old patient who presented as lethargic with headaches, vomiting, and nausea.

Respondent’s failure to adequately examine Patient A by neglecting to perform an appropriate

neurologic examination and respond accordingly to Patient A’s symptoms led to a delay in the
time sensitive diagnosis of meningitis.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Proper Medical Records

13. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

14. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

15. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment, and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions when he treated
Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

16. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT Il
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation —
Consultation

17. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

18. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

19. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

20. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical

condition on April 6, 2019. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care provider

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition and such a timely
consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and may have enhanced the quality

of medical care provided to the patient regarding Patient A’s diagnosis of meningitis.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.
