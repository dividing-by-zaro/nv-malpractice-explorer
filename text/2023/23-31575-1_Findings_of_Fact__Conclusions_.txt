The Board, after due consideration of the record, evidence, and law, and being fully
advised in the premises, makes its FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND
ORDER in this matter, as follows:

FINDINGS OF FACT
I.

Respondent held an active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada issued by the
Board from August 17, 2006, until June 12, 2023. An Order for Summary Suspension of
Respondent’s license was filed on June 12, 2023, served on June 13, 2023, which immediately
suspended Respondent’s license until a show cause hearing could be held to determine if his
medical license would be reinstated during the regular hearing process. On July 11, 2023, a show
cause hearing was held at the office of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners and the
Hearing Officer entered her order on July 13, 2023, continuing the suspension of Respondent’s
medical license throughout the hearing process.

On June 15, 2023, the Investigative Committee filed its formal Complaint in

Il.

Respondent was timely and properly served with the Complaint, and all notices and orders
in advance of the hearing and adjudication thereon, in accordance with NRS and NAC
Chapters 630, NRS Chapters 241, 622A and 233B, and all legal requirements of due process.

Ill.

With respect to the allegations of the Complaint, the Board concludes that Respondent has
violated NRS 630.3065(2)(a) Knowing or Willful Failure to Comply with a Board Order, as
alleged in Count I. Accordingly, Respondent is subject to discipline pursuant to NRS 630.352.

Iv.

The Board finds that, pursuant to NRS 622.400, recovery from Respondent of reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigation and disciplinary
proceedings against Respondent is appropriate. The Board has reviewed the Investigative
Committee’s Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements and Attorneys’ Fees, and the Board finds
them to be the actual fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigative,
administrative and disciplinary proceedings against Respondent, and finds them to be reasonable,
necessary, and actually incurred based on: (1) the abilities, training, education, experience,
professional standing and skill demonstrated by Board staff and attorneys; (2) the character of the
work done, its difficulty, its intricacy, its importance, the time and skill required, the responsibility
imposed and the prominence and character of the parties where, as in this case, they affected the
importance of the litigation; (3) the work actually performed by the Board’s attorneys and staff,
and the skill, time and attention given to that work; and (4) the product of the work and benefits to
the Board and the people of Nevada that were derived therefrom.

Vv.

If any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law is more properly deemed a Finding of Fact, it

may be so construed.

ls Introduction

This matter was heard in the Reno office of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(the “Board”) on August 31, 2023. Present were Ian Cumings, J.D. on behalf of the Investigative
Committee (the “IC”), Respondent Dietrich Von Feldmann, M.D. (“Respondent”) representing
himself, and the undersigned hearing officer. The IC submitted its Exhibits 1-3, which were
admitted. On behalf of Respondent, the IC also sought to admit an August 10, 2023 letter from
Respondent to Victor Muro, M.D., which was filed in the record on August 17, 2023, and which
was admitted. Appearing on behalf of the IC was Johnna S. LaRue, the Board compliance officer,
who was properly sworn as was Respondent who testified on his own behalf. No other witnesses
were called.

2. Allegations
The Complaint alleges a single count of Knowing or Willful Failure to Comply with a

Board Order, a violation of NRS 630.3065(2)(a), which is premised upon the allegation that
Respondent failed to comply with the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order, in Case
Number 22-31575-1, filed on December 8, 2022, and served upon Respondent on December 9,
2022 (the “Order”). The Order required Respondent to submit to a physical exam; submit to a
mental exam testing his competence; if found competent, to complete twelve hours of Continuing
Medical Education relating to the management of surgical patients with potential colon
perforation; to pay a fine of $2,000; and to reimburse the Board for incurred costs and expenses in
the amount of $8,621.90, all of which was to be done within six months of service of the Order.
See IC Exhibits 1 and 2. No answer was filed by Respondent.

3. Witnesses and Testimony

In support of the IC allegations, the IC called Board Compliance Officer Johnna S. LaRue
who testified as to Respondent’s failure to comply. Ms. LaRue’s testimony was uncontested.
Further, Respondent admitted to his failure to comply. In addressing his lack of compliance,
Respondent continues to take issue with the Findings and Conclusions made in matter 22-31575-
1. Respondent remains adamant that he did not commit malpractice and that he has not been able
to properly plead his defense based upon his lack of resources to hire legal counsel.

4, Findings

By Respondent’s own admission, he has knowingly or willfully failed to comply with the
Board’s Order, which is a violation of NRS 630.3065(2)(a).

5. Recommendation

For the reasons set forth above, I find that the IC met its burden of proof in relation to
Count 1 of the Complaint against Respondent (the only count alleged), and I respectfully
recommend that the Board confirm that Respondent knowingly or willfully failed to comply with
the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order filed in Case Number 22-31575-1 on

December 8, 2022, and served upon Respondent on December 9, 2022. Respondent’s license has



been suspended pending further action by the Board. See the Order for Continued License

Suspension, filed on July 13, 2023.
