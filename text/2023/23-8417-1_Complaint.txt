BEFORE THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS

OF THE STATE OF NEVADA
In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 23-8417-1
Against: FILED
ALAN DAVID STELJES, M.D., APR 25 2023
Respondent. NEVADA SfAJE BOARD OF
Ned) oA anes
By:
COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Alan David Steljes, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 6360). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on October 10, 1989. Respondent’s specialties are listed as
cardiovascular diseases and internal medicine.

2. Patient A? was a thirty-six (36) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. On May 16, 2017, Patient A was referred to Respondent by his primary physician
due to an abnormal EKG result.

4. On June 9, 2017, Patient A presented to Respondent’s cardiology clinic.

Respondent ordered an echocardiogram and sleep study for Patient A.

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Col. Eric D. Wade,
USAF (Ret.), and Carl N. Williams, Jr., M.D.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5: On June 29, 2017, Patient A underwent the echocardiogram ordered by
Respondent. Respondent’s cardiology clinic then generated a two-page report showing the results
of the echocardiogram. That same day, Respondent signed the echocardiogram report as the
interpreting physician.

6. The second page of the echocardiogram report clearly indicated Patient A’s aortic
root was significantly dilated at 55cm. The echocardiogram report also indicated that Patient A
had a moderately severe aortic valve regurgitation.

7. Thoracic aortic measurements greater than 4cm are generally considered to be
consistent with an aneurysm. A thoracic aortic aneurysm increases the risk of dissection and
tupture as the aortic size increases.

8. On July 19, 2017, Patient A met with Respondent to review the echocardiogram
results. Respondent did not inform Patient A that Patient A’s thoracic aortic root was significantly
dilated. Respondent further did not explain and address a management plan with Patient A
regarding the dilated thoracic aortic root in conjunction with Patient A’s moderate aortic valve
regurgitation.

9. On July 19, 2017, Respondent further did not refer Patient A to a cardiothoracic
surgeon for further evaluation.

10. Patient A died on or about October 9, 2017. A postpartum examination showed
Patient A died of dissection and rupture of his ascending aorta with hemopericardium, as a
consequence of hypertensive cardiovascular disease.

COUNT I

13. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

14. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A when Respondent failed to 1) inform Patient A of the
dilated aortic root after Patient A’s June 29, 2017 echocardiogram; and 2) explain and address a
management plan with Patient A regarding the dilated thoracic aortic root in conjunction with
Patient A’s moderate aortic valve regurgitation.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

16. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

18. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a

COUNT OT
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation —
Consultation
21. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

reference as though fully set forth herein.
22. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary

action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

23. | NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

24. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition on or about June 29, 2017. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care
provider, such as a cardiothoracic surgeon, to address the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical
condition and such a timely consultation may have enhanced the quality of medical care provided
to the patient regarding Patient A’s dilated thoracic aortic root.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against her and give
her notice that she may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

6. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these

premises.
