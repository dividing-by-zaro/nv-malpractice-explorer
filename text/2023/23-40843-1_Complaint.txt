BEFORE THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS
OF THE STATE OF NEVADA

In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 23-40843-1
Against:
CHARLES BRIAN KIM, M.D.,
Respondent.
COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Charles Brian Kim, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 14791). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on May 15, 2013.

2. Patient A* was a seventy-one (71) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. On March 26, 2019, Patient A presented to Respondent for an initial visit.
Respondent noted that Patient A had a left inguinal hernia. Patient A agreed to have Respondent
perform a robotically assisted left inguinal hernia repair (hereinafter referred to as “the surgery”).

4. On May 20, 2019, Respondent performed the surgery on Patient A. At this time,

Respondent was aware that Patient A was a Jehovah’s Witness and that pursuant to his religious

M.D., and Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.).

convictions, Patient A did not want to have a blood transfusion under any circumstances prior to
starting the procedure.

5. During the surgery on May 20, 2019, while Respondent was operating the robotic
device, Patient A suffered a through-and-through injury to his abdominal aorta. The punctures in
Patient A’s aorta caused substantial bleeding. Patient A’s blood pressure dropped precipitously,
indicating hypotension.

6. Respondent’s operating notes do not indicate that Respondent noticed a major
expanding hematoma in Patient A’s abdomen area at this time. Respondent’s operating notes also
do not indicate any problems with the robotic entry into Patient A’s abdomen.

7. After discovery of Patient A’s hypotension, an accompanying anesthesiologist then
inserted an arterial line and a central line into Patient A, gave fluids to Patient A, and performed a
Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) to evaluate Patient A’s heart.

8. Respondent did not perform an immediate laparotomy and instead first performed a
diagnostic laparoscopy. Respondent reintroduced a camera into Patient A’s abdomen, but
Respondent did not discern any reason for Patient A’s hypotension.

9. Patient A continued to decompensate, leading Respondent to consider a vascular
injury. Respondent left the operating room and discussed the situation with Patient A’s wife.
Patient A’s wife refused to have blood products given to Patient A, due to Patient A’s Jehovah’s
Witness affiliation.

10. Respondent and a vascular-trained colleague returned to the operating room.
Respondent and his colleague performed an exploratory laparotomy, which revealed the two (2)
punctures in Patient A’s abdominal aorta. Respondent repaired the injury to Patient A’s
abdominal aorta. Patient A was then brought to the ICU. Due to the significant loss of blood,
Patient A’s condition deteriorated quickly after entering the ICU, and Patient A died on
May 20, 2019.
