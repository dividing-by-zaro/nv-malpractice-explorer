5. On October 26, 2022, Patient A was seen by a perinatologist at a high-risk
pregnancy center due to her twin pregnancy and diagnosed with gestational diabetes, Patient A’s
pregnancy continued to be monitored with serial ultrasounds.

6. On November 22, 2022, Respondent lost his hospital privileges at Renown
Regional Medical Center (Renown Hospital) following a voluntary surrender of his clinical
privileges while under, or to avoid, an investigation relating to his professional competence or his
conduct

7. On February 8, 2023, Patient A underwent ultrasound testing at the high-risk
pregnancy center which indicated Twin A was growth restricted. Following Twin A’s diagnosis
of growth restriction, Patient A was recommended to deliver sometime between thirty-six (36) and
thirty-seven (37) weeks of gestation by her perinatologist and to continue to receive ultrasound
testing every two (2) weeks to monitor her pregnancy.

8. On March 30, 2023, at thirty-six (36) weeks pregnant, Patient A underwent further
ultrasound testing that was performed by the perinatologist which demonstrated little growth from
the previous ultrasound on March 13, 2023. The perinatologist recommended delivery between
thirty-six weeks (36) and thirty-six weeks and three days (36.3) weeks

9. On March 30, 2023, Patient A was seen by Respondent who performed a
membrane sweep on Patient A to help induce labor As Respondent did not have hospital
privileges and was unable to fully induce labor in Patient A nor deliver Patient A’s children, he
instructed her to present to the emergency department at Renown Hospital should she go into
labor.

10 Respondent failed to refer Patient A to an appropriate care provider or physician
group who could properly induce Patient A for delivery of her pregnancy, despite his knowledge
of the perinatologist’s delivery recommendation.

11. On April 1, 2023, Patient A had yet to go into labor, and presented to Renown
Hospital for delivery of her children within the recommended time given to her by the
perinatologist. Patient A ultimately delivered her children by cesarean section on April 2, 2023, at

Renown Hospital by a physician with privileges at the hospital.
