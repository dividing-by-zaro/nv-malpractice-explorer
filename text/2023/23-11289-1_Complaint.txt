The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 13772). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on December 3, 2010.

2. The true identities of Patients A and B are not disclosed herein to protect their
individual privacy, but their identities are disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon

Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

PATIENT A
3. Patient A was a fifty-three (53) year-old female at the onset of the events at issue.

oxycodone, alprazolam, amphetamine-dexamphetamine, and zolpidem, from 2017 to 2021.
Patient A’s health problems included chronic back and other musculoskeletal pain, attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and depression.

5. During Respondent’s care of Patient A, Respondent prescribed controlled
substances to Patient A over several intervals greater than ninety (90) days without accessing the
Nevada State Pharmacy Board’s Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP).

6. Respondent has had an active PMP account since on or about December 19, 2013.

7. Respondent prescribed alprazolam to Patient A between 2017 and 2021.
Alprazolam is typically used to treat acute anxiety and panic disorders. However, Respondent’s
notes regarding Patient A only make one reference to anxiety, on June 30, 2021. There are
multiple notes including alprazolam as treatment of patient’s back pain. Respondent’s notes do
not document the reasoning for continued prescription of alprazolam for back pain.

8. Additionally, there are notes from October 19, 2019, stating that Patient A required
opiate therapy, but Respondent’s notes regarding Patient A do not contain consistent metrics such
as level of pain or activities of daily living (AODL).

9. Respondent’s notes list the prescription of azithromycin, medrol, bactrim, and
silvadene over several months without any documentation as to why and for how long they are
being prescribed.

practitioner shall not prescribe the controlled substance unless the
practitioner determines that issuing the prescription is medically
necessary.

14. Respondent violated NRS 639.23507(1) by failing to obtain or review the patient

February 2015 and August 2016, which tested positive for opiates that were not being prescribed

apparent use of heroin.

Patient B regarding goals of treatment for pain or substance use disorder.

Patient B over several intervals greater than ninety (90) days without accessing the Nevada PMP.
