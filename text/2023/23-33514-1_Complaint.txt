originally licensed by the Board on February 20, 2008. Respondent’s specialty is listed as

3. Patient A had a history of a prior spinal surgery and had undergone an initial
posterior spinal fixation on June 3, 2016. Subsequently, Patient A underwent a revision surgery
on January 30, 2017.


| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Carl N. Williams, M.D.,

4. An X-ray obtained on March 3, 2017, and a subsequent X-ray on April 7, 2017,
demonstrated that Patient A had undergone a posterior spinal fixation from the second lumbar
vertebrae (L2) through the first sacral vertebrae (S1).

5. On May 31, 2017, Patient A had a second posterior spinal fixation revision for the
replacement of failed instrumentation.

6. Patient A had an X-ray obtained on June 12, 2017, which demonstrated the
May 31, 2017, revision and extension of the fixation to the second sacral vertebrae (S2) which
included bilateral iliac bolts. At the time of the June 12, 2017 X-ray, the iliac bolts did not
demonstrate screw cup displacement.

7. An X-ray of Patient A was obtained on August 4, 2017, and interpreted by the
Respondent.

8. The August 4, 2017, X-ray shows a clear displacement of the right iliac bolt screw
cup which the Respondent failed to identify or note in his report.

COUNT I

9, All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

10. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a Physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

11. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

12. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A by failing to identify and note the right iliac bolt screw cap
had loosened on his August 4, 2017, X-ray.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
