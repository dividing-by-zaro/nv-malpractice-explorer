By:

In the Matter of Charges and Complaint

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Brandee Mooneyhan, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that David Michael Snipper, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 6112). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on August 25, 1990, and specializes in anesthesiology.

2. At the time of the events at issue, Patient A? was twenty-seven (27) years old and
thirty-eight (38) weeks pregnant.

3. On or about December 24, 2015, Patient A, went into labor and presented at
Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, to deliver her child.


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Aury Nagy, M.D., and
Michael C. Edwards, M.D., FACS.

> Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4. After arriving at the hospital, Patient A was attended to by an obstetrician and other
medical professionals, including Respondent, who administered a series of epidural injections to
address Patient A’s pain.

5. Eventually, on or about December 25, 2015, the obstetrician overseeing Patient A’s
delivery determined that Patient A should deliver her child by Cesarean delivery (C-section), and
the necessary arrangements were made.

6. At approximately 1:50 p.m. on December 25, 2015, Respondent re-dosed
Patient A’s epidural, and she was taken to the operating room.

7. Respondent and the obstetrician determined that Patient A’s sensation level was
appropriate for surgery, and at approximately 2:10 p.m., the obstetrician began the C-section by
making an incision in Patient A’s skin.

8. When Patient A experienced pain upon incision, Respondent administered
additional medications intravenously to address that pain. When Patient A continued to
experience pain, Respondent and the obstetrician determined that general anesthesia should be
induced.

9. Respondent administered pre-oxygenation to Patient A and then propofol and
succinylcholine to induce general anesthesia. In anticipation of intubating Patient A, Respondent
proceeded to perform a laryngoscopy, during which he “could not see the glottic opening at all,”
and he “called for a glidescope” but there was not one immediately available.

10. Respondent attempted, and failed, to blindly insert the endotracheal tube. He then
ventilated Patient A and placed upon her a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and applied cricoid
pressure and told the obstetrician to proceed with the C-section.

11. Respondent maintained Patient A’s airway with the LMA during the C-section, and
Patient A’s baby was delivered.

12. Because Respondent was unable to visualize Patient A’s glottic opening during the
laryngoscopy and was unable to intubate her, he was aware that Patient A had a difficult airway.

13. After the C-section was complete, despite being aware that Patient A had a difficult

airway, Respondent removed the LMA before Patient A emerged from anesthesia. At the time he

removed the LMA, Respondent was not prepared to properly manage Patient A’s difficult airway,
such as by arranging for the availability of specialized equipment for difficult airway management
or ensuring that an additional person was immediately available to assist in managing a difficult
airway.

14. After Respondent removed the LMA, he had continued difficulty with assisted
ventilation and oxygenation of Patient A, but did not call for appropriate assistance for
approximately thirty (30) minutes.

15. Respondent’s handwritten record of the anesthesia care he provided to Patient A on
or about December 25, 2015, documented his care of Patient A only up until the time she was
taken to the operating room; was largely illegible; and lacked times, vital signs, and a description
of events.

16. Respondent did not document what occurred during and after Patient A’s C-section
until he completed an additional typewritten narrative three (3) days later.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) — Malpractice

17. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

18. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against him.

19. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

20. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances by failing to make appropriate preparations to manage Patient A’s

difficult airway prior to removing the LMA and failing to promptly request assistance when he
