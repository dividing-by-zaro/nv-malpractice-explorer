4. On March 3, 2015, Patient A presented to the Respondent, who discussed treatment
protocols with Patient A, and recommended the placement of a MediPort, a surgically implanted
catheter installed beneath the skin into a vein that delivers chemotherapy medications.

5. On March 13, 2015, the patient presented to Respondent for an examination under
anesthesia which included a cervical biopsy, laparoscopic periaortic lymph node dissection, and
placement of the MediPort.

6. During the implantation of the MediPort, Respondent utilized a left subclavian
approach and implanted the catheter directly into Patient A’s aortic arch. Despite an attempt to
verify the placement of the catheter in Patient A’s vena cava with the use of fluoroscopy, the
catheter was incorrectly placed into the arterial system.

7. Respondent’s operative note fails to document the character of the blood returning
during placement of the catheter, and the details of the targeted vein are incorrect or omitted.

8. On April 18, 2015, Patient A was admitted to the hospital after suffering an acute
embolic stroke.

9. On April 20, 2015, a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of Patient A’s neck
demonstrated that the catheter tip of the MediPort was incorrectly placed into Patient A’s aortic
arch at the origin of the left common carotid artery.

disciplinary action against a licensee.

12. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

13. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed

to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when

and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

17. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document her actions when she treated
Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

18. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
