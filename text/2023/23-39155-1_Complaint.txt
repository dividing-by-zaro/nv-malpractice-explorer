Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
By:

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Donald K. White, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the
IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Warren S. Basilan, RRT (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating
the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a respiratory therapist
holding an active license to practice respiratory therapy in the State of Nevada
(License No. RC1999). Respondent was originally licensed by the Board on August 10, 2011.

2. Pursuant to NRS 630.309 and NAC 630.540 (23), Respondent is subject to the
same disciplinary measures as a practitioner of medicine.

3. Patient A? was a sixty-nine (69) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

4. On September 4, 2020, Patient A was transferred to AMG Specialty Hospital for
treatment of pneumonia and respiratory failure, after spending several days at North Vista

Hospital.

1 The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ahsan,
MLD., Ph.D., FACC, and Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.).

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient

Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. Patient A required a ventilator for respiratory support, as he had a history of
chronic respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
pulmonary hypertension, sleep apnea, morbid obesity, and metabolic encephalopathy.

6. Patient A was ventilated through a tracheostomy tube placed in his tracheostomy
site.

7. On September 21, 2020, sometime during the early morning hours, Respondent had
placed Patient A’s ventilator settings on Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV) 10cmH20 over Peak
End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) 5cmH20, or PSV 10/5.

8. On September 21, 2020, a dayshift respiratory therapist (RT) found Patient A in
respiratory distress at approximately 0640 hours with a bleeding tracheotomy site and blood in the
ventilator circuit, after receiving a report from Respondent, who was on the night shift. Upon
information and belief, the dayshift RT had received that report approximately between 0600 and
0620 hours.

9. The dayshift RT noted that Patient A’s ventilator settings were PSV 10/5.

10. | Respondent’s last charting showed Patient A to be on Assist Control (AC)
ventilation, and he did not chart that he changed Patient A’s ventilator setting back to PSV 10/5.

11. Patient A was required to be on AC because he was not tolerating PSV well.
Therefore Respondent placed Patient A on an unsafe ventilator setting.

12. Respondent further did not monitor Patient A when he went into a different room
to work on his patient charts and placed Patient A on PSV in an effort to silence any alarms
coming from the ventilator.

13. At approximately 0735 hours, the dayshift RT called an emergency medical
transport for Patient A to transfer him to a hospital, where Patient A later expired.

NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice
