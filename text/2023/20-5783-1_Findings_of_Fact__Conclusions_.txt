Respondent was timely and properly served with the Complaint, and all notices and orders
in advance of the hearing and adjudication thereon, in accordance with NAC Chapter 630,
and NRS Chapters 630, 241, 622A and 233B, and all legal requirements of due process.

Ill.

With respect to the allegations of the Complaint, the Board concludes that Respondent has
violated the Medical Practice Act, as alleged in the Complaint, as follows: one (1) count of
NRS 630.301(4) Malpractice (Count I), one (1) count of NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) Violation of
Standards of Practice (Count II), and one (1) count of NRS 630.3062(1)(a) Failure to Maintain
Complete Medical Records (Count III). Accordingly, Respondent is subject to discipline pursuant
to NRS 630.352.

Iv.

The Board finds that, pursuant to NRS 622.400, recovery from Respondent of reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigation and disciplinary
proceedings against Respondent is appropriate. The Board has reviewed the Investigative
Committee’s Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements and Attorneys’ Fees; and the Board finds
them to be the actual fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigative,
administrative and disciplinary proceedings against Respondent, and finds them to be reasonable
and necessary based on: (1) the abilities, training, education, experience, professional standing
and skill demonstrated by Board staff and attorneys; (2) the character of the work done, its
difficulty, its intricacy, its importance, the time and skill required, the responsibility imposed and
the prominence and character of the parties where, as in this case, they affected the importance of
the litigation; (3) the work actually performed by the Board’s attorneys and staff, and the skill,
time and attention given to that work; and (4) the product of the work and benefits to the Board
and the people of Nevada that were derived therefrom.

Vv.
If any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law is more properly deemed a Finding of Fact, it

may be so construed.

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

TO: Deonne E. Contine, Esq.
Deputy General Counsel
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
9600 Gateway Drive
Reno, Nevada 89521

Richard Allan Bargen, M.D.
490 HIGHLAND AVE. #24
Reno, NV 89512

This matter came for hearing on May 15, 2023. Present were Deonne E. Contine, Esq. on
behalf of the Investigative Committee (the “IC’’) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(“NSBME”), and the undersigned hearing officer. Respondent Richard Allan Bargen, M.D. (“Dr.
Bargen’’) did not appear nor otherwise participate.

Notice to Dr. Bargen was confirmed on the record. Specifically, proof was submitting
indicating that the Scheduling Order, filed April 18, 2023, which contained notice of the hearing
was sent by certified mail to Dr. Bargen by Ms. Mercedes Fuentes on April 19, 2023, at his last
known address on file with the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (the “Board”’). See
NRS 630.254; NRS 630.255; NRS 630.344; Scheduling Order, p. 4. While Dr. Bargen had
communications with the Board, the record indicates that he did not provide an alternative

address, was aware of the proceedings, and did not engage in the proceedings despite several



notices and attempts to contact him.! See Volume 1, Exhibit 2. No continuance of the hearing
was requested by any interested party.
With Dr. Bargen having failed to appear and no continuance having been requested nor

granted, the matter was heard as scheduled pursuant to NRS 622A.350, which provides:

1. If a party fails to appear at a scheduled hearing and a continuance
has not been scheduled or granted, any party who is present at the hearing may
make an offer of proof that the absent party was given sufficient legal notice. Upon
a determination by the regulatory body or hearing panel or officer that the absent
party was given sufficient legal notice, the regulatory body or hearing panel or
officer may proceed to consider and dispose of the case without the participation of
the absent party.

2. Ifthe licensee fails to appear at a hearing, the regulatory body or
hearing panel or officer may accept the allegations against the licensee in the
charging document as true.

As well as pursuant to NAC 630.470(2), which provides: “If a licensee fails to appear at a
scheduled hearing and no continuance has been requested and granted, the evidence may be heard
and the matter may be considered and disposed of on the basis of the evidence before the Board,
panel or hearing officer in the manner required by this section.”

In so proceeding, undersigned heard evidence from the IC in support of the Complaint
allegations that consist of: Count I, NRS 630.301(4), Malpractice; and Count II, NRS
630.306(1)(b)(2), Violation of Standards of Practice; and Count II, NRS 630.3062(1)(a), Failure
to Maintain Complete Medical Records), premised upon controlled substances being prescribed
and administered by an unknown provider, by and through credentials held by Dr. Bargen, and by
Dr. Bargen himself. Through sworn testimony of Chief Investigator for the Nevada State Board
of Medical Examiners Ernesto Diaz, and through the admission of Exhibits 1-6, the IC established
as follows:

1. Dr. Bargen was employed as a locums for Dr. Gary Ridenour, a physician located

in Fallon, Nevada. See Volume I, Exhibit 2.

| Tn this respect, there are no filings in the record on behalf of Dr. Bargen including, but not limited to, an Answer to
the Complaint.



2. While investigating to file a Complaint against another physician, Dr. Gary
Ridenour, a peer review from Robert Gong, MD, dated January 6, 2020, referenced Dr. Richard
Bargen as a physician whose treatment fell below the standard of care. See Volume I, Exhibit 1,
p. 1, paragraph 10; Transcript of Hearing Proceedings, p. 9.

3. Multiple attempts were made by the IC to reach Dr. Bargen, to no avail. See
Volume I, Exhibit 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6; Transcript of Hearing Proceedings, pp. 9-17.

4. The NSBME arranged with a process server, Legal Process Service, to personally
serve Dr. Bargen at the last known address that he supplied to NSBME and the IC. See Volume I,
Exhibit 1, p. 3; Exhibit 2; Exhibit 5; Transcript of Hearing Proceedings, pp. 23-25.

5. When the NSBME was unable to contact Dr. Bargen, it arranged for service by

publication. Volume I, Exhibit 6; Transcript of Hearing Proceedings 25-26.

WHEREFORE the undersigned hearing officer finds as follows:

Proper notice of the proceedings, inclusive of the evidentiary hearing, was provided to Dr.
Bargen and no continuance of the evidentiary hearing was sought nor granted;

Pursuant to NRS 622A.350(2) the undersigned accepts the allegations against Dr. Bargen
in the Complaint, filed June 10, 2020, as true;

Aside from the authority granted by NRS 622A.350(2), the undersigned hearing officer
finds that the IC established a violation of Count I, NRS 630.301(4), Malpractice, by establishing,
as alleged, that Dr. Bargen dispensed, and prescribed excessively high doses of controlled
substances to Patient A and that Dr. Bargen further failed to monitor, assess, or review the use of
opioids or discuss alternatives with the patient, which compounded the improprieties engaged in
by Dr. Bargen with respect thereto. The foregoing establishes that Dr. Bargen failed to use the
reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when he provided
medical services to Patient A, in a manner not authorized by law as contemplated by NRS

630.306(4).



Aside from the authority granted by NRS 622A.350(2), the undersigned hearing officer
finds that the IC established a violation of Count II, NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2), Violation of Standards
of Practice, by establishing that Dr. Bargen furnished opioids to Patient A as described above, i.e.,
in excessively high doses while failing to justify changes in doses, in a combination with other
medications without documenting the medical justification, failing to review the PMP after
encounters with the patient, failing to assess the patient for alternative non-opioid therapy or to
assess the possible interaction of patient’s concurrent medications with opioid therapy; failing to
assess the patient for possible drug abuse, drug diversion or other non-medical related activity,
failing to review the PMP data or to assess the patient for possible drug screens. The foregoing
establishes that Dr. Bargen engaged in behavior that violated the professional standards in the
practice of medicine contrary to law.

Aside from the authority granted by NRS 622A.350(2), the undersigned hearing officer
finds that the IC established a violation of Count III, NRS 630.3062(1)(a), Failure to Maintain
Complete Medical Records, by establishing that Dr. Bargen failed to maintain timely, complete,

legible, and accurate medical records relating to the diagnosis; treatment, and care of Patient A.

BASED UPON THE FOREGOING, it is recommended that the Board find Dr. Bargen in
violation of NRS 630.301(4), Malpractice, as alleged in Count I of the Complaint filed on June
10, 2020; NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2), Violation of Standards of Practice, as alleged in Count II of the
Complaint filed on June 10, 2020; and NRS 630.3062(1)(a), failure to Maintain Complete
Medical Records, as alleged in Count III of the Complaint filed on June 10, 2020.

RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 3rd day of July 2023.
