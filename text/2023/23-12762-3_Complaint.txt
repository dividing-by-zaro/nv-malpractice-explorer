In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 23-12762-3
Against: FILED
SAMUEL RODOLFO CHACON, M.D., SEP 08 2023
Respondent. NEVADA Wi BOARD OF
MEI ‘AMINERS
By: ——
COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through its counsel, Deonne E. Contine, General Counsel and Ian J. Cumings,
Deputy General Counsel and attorneys for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Samuel
Rodolfo Chacon, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS)
Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical
Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 9105). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 27, 1999, with a specialty in Obstetrics/Gynecology.

2. Patient A? was a sixty-five (65) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. Records indicate that Respondent first saw Patient A on February 24, 2021, when
she presented with a right labial mass. The mass was determined to be a Bartholin cyst that had
decreased in size over time and Patient A was given instructions on sitz baths. The records for
Patient A from the Assessment and Diagnosis section for this


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Aury Nagy, M.D., Chairman, Nicola (Nick)
Spirtos, M.D., F.A.C.O.G., and Ms. Maggie Arias-Petrel.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

visit indicated a plan to follow-up with a biopsy of a right-sided mole, which was presumably
discovered during a gynecological examination that day.

4. There was no documentation of urinary incontinence in any section of the February
24, 2021, medical records from Respondent for Patient A.

5. Respondent’s medical records did not document any communication between
Patient A and Respondent or his staff regarding incontinence, bladder issues, or conducting
urodynamics testing? prior to Patient A presenting to Respondent’s office for her biopsy
appointment on March 5, 2021.

6. On March 5, 2021, within Respondent’s notes in the Chief Complaint section of
Patient A’s medical records, there was inclusion of Urodynamics testing. This testing was not
discussed with Patient A prior to this visit.

7. Patient A complained that when she presented for her appointment on
March 5, 2021, for the biopsy of the Bartholin cyst, the room was set up for a Urodynamics study.
After Patient A argued with Respondent and his office staff regarding the actual purpose of her
visit, Patient A ultimately convinced Respondent to perform the biopsy.

8. Thereafter, over Patient A’s objection that she had no bladder problems,
Respondent insisted that Patient A complete the bladder test anyway and proceeded to conduct the
Urodynamics study immediately following collection of the biopsy specimen. Patient A’s medical
records did not include documentation of a written or oral consent to the Urodynamics study
performed on March 5, 2021.

9. Respondent scheduled the Urodynamics study prior to Patient A’s March 5, 2021,
appointment. However, the first mention in Respondent’s medical records of urinary incontinence
and pelvic pressure for Patient A was from the March 5, 2021, visit.

10.  Respondent’s records are inaccurate because Patient A did not discuss urinary
incontinence with Respondent at any time and, in fact, Patient A had never complained to

Respondent of any problems with her bladder.

3 A Urodynamic study is a test used to help diagnose problems with urination or urinary incontinence. It
involves insertion of a catheter into the bladder and may involve an additional catheter placed in a patient’s vagina or
rectum.

11. Patient A’s medical records lacked any documentation of either subjective or
objective urinary incontinence evaluations nor documented any discussions between Respondent
and Patient A about any degree of bother that urinary incontinence presented for her.

12. With respect to the Urodynamics study results, the 3-Channel CMG
(cystometrogram) portion DOES NOT match the documented description from Patient A’s
March 5, 2021, records and the CMG tracing DOES NOT match the markings on the tracing.

13. Following her March 5, 2021, appointment, Respondent’s staff called Patient A to
schedule her return for her biopsy results; however, Patient A never returned to see Respondent
for gynecological care.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

14. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

15. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

16. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

17. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he performed an unindicated procedure (the Urodynamics study) on Patient A because he had no
documentation of either subjective or objective urinary incontinence and no documented
discussion regarding the degree of bother that urinary incontinence presented for Patient A.
Patient A had never complained to or asked Respondent to address urinary incontinence because
she did not have any bladder problems.

18. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute

21. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by, among other things, failing to document either subjective or
objective urinary incontinence or any discussion regarding the degree of bother that urinary
incontinence presented for Patient A in support of him performing the Urodynamics study.

22.  Respondent’s records are inaccurate because Patient A never discussed urinary
incontinence with Respondent and, in fact, Patient A had never complained to Respondent of any
problems with her bladder.

23. Finally, there are numerous additional inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and omissions
in Respondent’s records for Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate,
or complete.

provided in NRS 630.352.

discipline.

27. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent
violated NRS 630.301(8) regarding Patient A’s medical conditions when Respondent performed
an unindicated procedure on Patient A, specifically the Urodynamics study. Respondent’s
performance of the aforementioned procedure occurred without a medical purpose and with the

28. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

reference as though fully set forth herein.

30. | NRS 630.301(7) provides that “engaging in conduct that violates the trust of a
patient and exploits the relationship between the physician and the patient for financial or other
personal gain” is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

31. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent
violated the trust of and exploited the relationship between the Respondent and Patient A by
performing the Urodynamics study on Patient A over her objection and despite having no
objective or subjective documentation of urinary incontinence and no documented discussion with
or complaint from Patient A regarding urinary incontinence or bladder problems.

32. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT V

34,  NRS 630.301(6) provides that disruptive behavior with patients that interferes with
patient care or has an adverse impact on the quality of care rendered to a patient is grounds for
initiating disciplinary action against a physician.

35.  Respondent’s behavior by performing a Urodynamic study procedure of which
Patient A did not consent and which was conducted for no medical purpose, was demeaning,
humiliating, and traumatizing to Patient A and thus adversely affected the quality of care rendered
to her.

36. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1, That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
