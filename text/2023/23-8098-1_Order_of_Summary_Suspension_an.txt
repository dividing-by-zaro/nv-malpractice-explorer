4. On October 21, 2021, Ms. Watson entered into an agreement to participate in a
program administered by the Kentucky Professional Recovery Network (KYPRN) which is to be

5. As part of the program administered by KYPRN, Ms. Watson agreed to abstain
from any drugs and alcohol.

6. On February 23, 2022, KYPRN notified the Board that Ms. Watson tested positive
for alcohol metabolites from a blood draw on February 10, 2022.

7. Ms. Watson believed that she had obtained a false positive and selected for a
follow up blood test on or around February 24, 2022.

alcohol metabolites from the February 24, 2022, blood draw.
