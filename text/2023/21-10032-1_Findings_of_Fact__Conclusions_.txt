Profession into Disrepute, and Count 259: violation of NRS 630.301(4), Malpractice. Counsel for
the IC moved to dismiss Count 258, violation of NRS 630.3065(2)(a), Violation of a Board Order,
during closing argument, of which there was no objection. The hearing officer found that

Count 260 shall be dismissed.

to enforce.

Vv.

The Board has reviewed the Investigative Committee’s Memorandum of Costs and
Disbursements and Attorneys’ Fees, and the Board finds them to be the actual fees and costs
incurred by the Board as part of its investigative, administrative and disciplinary proceedings
against Respondent, and finds them to be reasonable based gn: (1) the abilities, training,
education, experience, professional standing and skill demonstrated by Board staff and attorneys;
(2) the character of the work done, its difficulty, its intricacy, its importance, the time and skill
required, the responsibility imposed and the prominence and character of the parties where, as in
this case, they affected the importance of the litigation; (3) the work actually performed by the
Board’s attorneys and staff, and the skill, time and attention given to that work; and (4) the
product of the work and benefits to the Board and the people of Nevada that were derived
therefrom.

VI.

If any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law is more properly deemed a Finding of Fact, it

may be so construed.
