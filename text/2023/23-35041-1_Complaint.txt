kKREAEKS

In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 23-35041-1
Against:
YEVGENTY ANATOLIY KHAVKIN, M.D.,

Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Brandee Mooneyhan, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Yevgeniy Anatoliy Khavkin, M.D., (Respondent) violated
the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the
IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

L. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 13271). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on August 26, 2009, and specializes in neurological surgery.

2. Patient A? was a fifty-six (56) year-old male with a history of pain in his neck and
lower back when the events described below began.

3. Patient A was referred by his primary care physician to Respondent for
consultation regarding his pain, and Patient A first presented to Respondent’s clinic on
March 14, 2017.


| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., (Chair),
Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.) (Public Member), and Carl N. Williams, Jr., M.D., FACS.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4, Respondent’s record of the March 14, 2017, encounter indicates that Patient A
“tha[d] not had any recent conservative treatment and now presents for neurological evaluation.”

5. Respondent ordered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of Patient A’s cervical and
lumbar spine; pursuant to Respondent’s order, Patient A had an MRI of his lumbar spine on
March 31, 2017.

6. In pertinent part, the radiologist who performed the MRI of Patient A’s lumbar
spine found mild stenosis’ in the lumbar segments between Patient A’s L4 and L5 vertebrae (L4-

5)* and in the lumbosacral joint between the L5 vertebra and the sacrum (LS5-S1):

L4-5: There is mild, unchanged disc bulge eccentric to the left
without central canal stenosis. Mild bilateral facet osteoarthritis.
Mild bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis.

L5-S1: There is mild, unchanged disc bulge without central canal
stenosis. Mild bilateral facet osteoarthritis. Mild bilateral
neuroforaminal stenosis.

The radiologist found the vertebral segment between Patient A’s L3 and L4 vertebrae (L3-4)

essentially normal, with no central canal or neuroforaminal stenosis:

L3-4: There is mild, unchanged disc bulge without central canal
stenosis. Mild bilateral facet osteoarthritis. No neuroforaminal
stenosis.

The radiologist recorded his overall impression regarding Patient A’s spine as:

1. No appreciable interval change in mild multilevel degeneration
of the lumbar spine as detailed above with disc desiccation and
bulge at multiple levels but no central canal stenosis.

2. Mild bilateral L4-L5 and L5-S1 neural foraminal stenosis.

7. Patient A returned to Respondent’s clinic on April 11, 2017, for Respondent to

review the MRIs he had ordered.

3 “Spinal stenosis is narrowing of the spinal column that causes pressure on the spinal cord, or narrowing of
the openings (called neural foramina) where spinal nerves leave the spinal column.” See “Spinal stenosis,” Medical
Encyclopedia, https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000441.htm (last visited June 22, 2023). Such “narrowing puts
pressure on [the] nerves and spinal cord and can cause pain.” See “Spinal Stenosis,” Health Topics,
https://medlineplus.gow/spinalstenosis.html (last visited June 22, 2023).

4 “There are three main groups of vertebrae—the cervical vertebrae atop the spinal column, of which there
are seven; the thoracic vertebrae, situated below the cervical vertebrae, of which there are twelve; and the lumbar
vertebrae situated below the thoracic vertebrae, of which there are five. The letters ‘C,’ ‘T,’ and ‘L’ are used
respectively to designate cervical, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. The sacrum is located at the base of the spinal
column and below it, the coccyx or ‘tailbone.’ The five sacral and four coccygeal vertebrae are fused and together are
considered one bone.” Mousseau v. Schwartz, 756 N.W.2d 345, 347 n.2 (S.D. 2008).

8. Respondent’s records of the April 11, 2017, encounter state that his “[d]irect
visualization and independent interpretation” of the MRI of Patient A’s lumbar spine showed

“there are degenerative changes, most prominent at L4-L5 and L5-S1, with lumbar stenosis, both


central and foramen, as well as facet arthropathy.” Respondent indicated that he planned to

perform a “Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion w/Wide Decompression! [at] L45 L5S1””
on Patient A.
9. Respondent’s records of the April 11, 2017, encounter further state that he “had an

extensive discussion with the patient regarding [his] condition,’ and “[c]onsidering the
progressive nature of the symptoms and the fact that the patient failed to respond to aggressive
conservative measures, the patient is interested in proceeding with a surgical treatment consisting
of a posterior approach with transforaminal lumbar decompression and interbody fusion at L4-L5
and L5-S1.”

10. | Respondent’s records did not explain the discrepancy between his statement in the
record of his March 14, 2017, encounter that Patient A “ha[d] not had any recent conservative
treatment” and his statement in the record of his April 11, 2017, encounter that Patient A had
“failed to respond to aggressive conservative measures.” There is no documentation of any
conservative measures ordered or taken to address Patient A’s back pain, such as chiropractic

therapy, physical therapy, or pain management therapy, before Respondent recommended surgery.

5 Facet arthropathy is “a disease or abnormality of the facet joints”; as one federal district court explained:

The facet joints connect the vertebral bodies to one another, and like the hip and
the knee, they can also become arthritic and painful, and can be a source of back
pain. The facet joints are located at the back of the spine and counterbalance the
intervertebral discs. They help keep the normal alignment of the spinal vertebrae
and limit motion. The pain and discomfort that is caused by degeneration and
arthritis of this part of the spine is called facet arthropathy, which simply means a
disease or abnormality of the facet joints.

Wiley v. United of Omaha Life Ins. Co., No. 5:16-CV-1936-CLS, 2019 WL 2172708, at *16 (N.D. Ala. May 20,
2019) (internal citation omitted).

6 In the context of spinal surgery, decompression refers to the surgical relief of pressure on the spinal cord or
nerves.

7 “To accomplish the fusion during [transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion] surgery, two rods are placed
lengthwise on either side of the spine and attached with screws into the pedicle bones of the spine. This bracing
provides stability, while a small metal cage with bone-growth material is placed between the vertebra to facilitate new
bone growth and fusion of the spine.” Knight v. Clark, 283 So. 3d 1111, 1124 (Miss. Ct. App. 2019) (Westbrooks, J.,
dissenting) (internal footnotes omitted).

11. Included in Respondent’s medical records for Patient A is a “Procedure Check
List,” dated April 11, 2017, which indicates that Patient A’s diagnosis is “lumbar stenosis,” that
the procedure contemplated is “L45, LFS1 TLIF,” and that the surgery was scheduled for
May 19, 2017.

12. Patient A had another visit with Respondent on May 11, 2017, for a preoperative
consultation. Respondent’s record of the preoperative consultation states that Patient A was
“scheduled to undergo a lumbar decompression and fusion.” A narrative under the heading “Plan”
states in its entirety: “We went over the benefits and the risks. He acknowledged understanding
and wants to proceed.” The record indicates that it was electronically signed by Respondent on
June 30, 2017, several weeks after the encounter, and after the surgery referred to therein.

13. On the “Surgery & Procedure Scheduling Form/Physician Pre-Operative
Admission Orders” regarding the procedure, which appears to have been signed by Respondent
and transmitted to the hospital on or about May 11, 2017, in the space for “Procedure as it is to
appear on the Consent,’ was entered: “POSTERIOR APPROACH TRANFORAMINAL
LUMBAR INTERBODY FUSION WITH DECOMPRESSION FOUR TO SACRAL ONE.”®

14. The “Consent to Surgery and Other Invasive Procedures” regarding the planned
procedure, which was signed and dated on or about May 11, 2017, indicates that Patient A
authorized Respondent to perform “POSTERIOR APPROACH TRANSFORAMINAL LUMBAR
INTERBODY FUSION LUMBAR WITH DECOMPRESSION FOUR TO SACRAL ONE.”

15. On May 19, 2017, Patient A presented to Spring Valley Hospital Medical Center
for the planned transforaminal lumber interbody fusion with decompression at his L4-5 and L5-S1
vertebral segments.

16. The “Pre-Procedure Site Verification Note” regarding Patient A’s surgery, dated
May 19, 2017, which includes a drawing of a human body to allow marking of where a surgery is
to be performed, contains a handwritten phrase to the right of the drawing which reads: “posterior
approach transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion with decompression four to sacral one.”


8 This is consistent with the plan recorded in Respondent’s records of Patient A’s preoperative encounters, as
lumbar “four to sacral one” encompasses the L4-5 and L5-S1 vertebral segments.

17. As set forth above, all preoperative records regarding Patient A’s May 19, 2017,
surgery indicate that only the L4-5 and L5-S1 segments of Patient A’s spine were to be operated
upon; there is no indication that the L3-4 segment was a candidate for surgery.

18. During the May 19, 2017, surgery, in addition to performing the planned
procedures at the L4-5 and LS-S1 segments, Respondent operated on the L3-4 segment of
Patient A’s spine.

19. In his operative report of the May 19, 2017, surgery, Respondent stated that he

made an intraoperative decision to extend the surgery to the L3-4 segment:

L3-L4 segment was examined and appeared to be grossly unstable
with significant amount of abnormal motion present. Per my
previous discussion with the patient to accomplish better clinical
postoperative outcome and to avoid neurological deficits, it was
decided to incorporate the L3-L4 segment.

20. Respondent failed to explain in his operative report why the L3-4 segment was
“examined” in the midst of the May 19, 2017, surgery when the preoperative MRI showed it was
essentially normal, with no canal or foraminal narrowing, and thus not a reasonable candidate for
surgery.

21. Neither did Respondent explain how Patient A’s L3-4 segment was “examined” in
the midst of the May 19, 2017, surgery, when mere appearance of the segment would be
insufficient to demonstrate instability and physical manipulation of the segment would be
unwarranted.

22. Nor did Respondent explain what criteria he used to determine that the L3-4
segment was “grossly unstable” or provide any objective measurement of its alleged instability.

23. A neurosurgeon would not ordinarily “examine” the stability of a spinal segment
during a surgery being performed on other spinal segments, and the “appearance” of a spinal
segment is not sufficient to support a clinical determination regarding its stability.

24.  Respondent’s statement in his operative report that Patient A’s L3-4 segment was
“examined” in the midst of surgery and “appeared to be grossly unstable with significant amount
of abnormal motion present” is not sufficient justification for a reasonable neurosurgeon to fuse a

lumbar segment.

25. Respondent fused the L3-4 segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine in the absence of
sufficient evidence that such a procedure was medically necessary or advantageous to Patient A.

26. A neurosurgeon exercising the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
in performing spinal surgery would not fuse the L3-4 segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine in the
absence of sufficient evidence that it was medically necessary or advantageous to do so.

27. In agreeing to allow Respondent to operate on his spine, Patient A placed his trust
in Respondent to perform the procedure he represented he would and to exercise appropriate care
of Patient A during the planned surgery.

28. Respondent’s extension of the planned surgery to include fusion of the L3-4
segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine was completed while Patient A was unconscious and thus
exceedingly vulnerable.

29. Fusing an additional segment of Patient A’s lumbar spine and correspondingly
increasing the spinal hardware used during the spinal surgery increased the amount Respondent
would be paid for performing the surgery.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) — Malpractice

30. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

31. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

32. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

33. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when, during Patient A’s spinal surgery on May 19, 2017, he fused
the L3-4 segment of Patient A’s spine without sufficient evidence that it was medically necessary
to do so.

34. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
COUNT II
NRS 630.301(7) — Engaging in Conduct That Violates the Trust of a Patient and Exploits
the Relationship with the Patient for Financial or Other Personal Gain

35, All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

36. NRS 630.301(7) provides that “engaging in conduct that violates the trust of the
patient and exploits the relationship between the physician and the patient for financial or other
personal gain” constitutes grounds for initiating discipline against a physician.

37. By unnecessarily fusing Patient A’s L3-4 lumbar segment in the midst of surgery
planned for other spinal segments on May 19, 2017, thereby increasing the cost of the surgery and
his corresponding compensation, Respondent engaged in conduct that violated Patient A’s trust
and exploited his relationship with Patient A to realize a financial or other personal gain.

38. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT UI
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) — Failure to Maintain Accurate Medical Records

39. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

40. | NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

41. Respondent failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A when he failed to include adequate detail in his
operative report of Patient A’s May 19, 2017, spinal surgery as to: (1) why he examined the L3-4
vertebral segment when preoperative imaging showed it was essentially normal; (2) how he

examined the L3-4 vertebral segment; (3) what criteria he used to determine the L3-4 vertebral

NRS 630.301(9) — Disreputable Conduct

43. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

44.  NRS 630.301(9) provides that engaging in conduct that brings the medical
profession into disrepute constitutes grounds for initiating discipline against a physician.

45. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, by performing an
unnecessary surgical procedure and violating Patient A’s trust and exploiting his relationship with
Patient A in order to realize a financial or other personal gain, Respondent engaged in conduct that
brings the medical profession into disrepute.

46. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:
