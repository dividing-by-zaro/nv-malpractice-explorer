By:
COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Brandee Mooneyhan, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Rashid Jahangir, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1, Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 11124). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on September 2, 2004, and specializes in anesthesiology.

2. Patient A? was a forty-one (41) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On or about August 12, 2015, Patient A was transported to Sunrise Hospital in Las
Vegas, Nevada, with a primary complaint of shortness of breath.

4. After arriving at the hospital, Patient A was diagnosed with community-acquired
pneumonia and acute respiratory failure and was ultimately intubated.


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members M. Neil Duxbury, Aury Nagy, M.D., and
Michael C. Edwards, M.D.

Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. The doctor performing the intubation of Patient A noted that it was a “difficult
intubation and glide scope was needed for visualization.”

6. After several days in the hospital, the medical professionals caring for Patient A
determined that she should receive a tracheostomy and a percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy
(PEG) tube; those procedures were scheduled for August 23, 2015.

7. Respondent was the anesthesiologist for Patient A’s August 23, 2015,
tracheostomy and PEG tube placement.

8. Prior to initiating anesthesia of a patient, an anesthesiologist is responsible for
assessing the patient’s health, for example, by performing a physical examination and obtaining a
medical history, in order to formulate a safe and effective anesthesia plan tailored to the particular
patient.

9. Respondent failed to document that he conducted a physical examination of
Patient A prior to initiating her anesthetic care.

10. Additionally, despite the documentation that Patient A’s prior intubation was
“difficult” and required a glide scope, Respondent also failed to document that he prepared to
properly manage her difficult airway, such as by arranging for the availability of at a portable
storage unit containing specialized equipment for difficult airway management, ascertaining that
at least one additional person was immediately available to assist in managing the patient’s
difficult airway, administering preoxygenation, or pursuing opportunities to deliver supplemental
oxygen throughout the procedure.?

11. During surgery, an anesthesiologist’s responsibilities include monitoring and
managing the patient’s vital bodily functions, such as oxygenation, ventilation, and heart function.

12. During Patient A’s procedure on August 23, 2015, the surgeon’s first attempt at
performing a tracheostomy on Patient A failed.


3 See, e.g., J.L. Apfelbaum et al., “Practice guidelines for management of the difficult airway: An updated
report by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Management of the Difficult Airway,”
Anesthesiology 118:251-70 (2013).

13. During the surgeon’s second attempt at performing a tracheostomy, Patient A
experienced profound hypoxia, bradycardia, and cyanosis, and Patient A suffered anoxic brain
injury.

14. In part, the operative notes completed by the surgeon stated that Patient A’s oxygen
“saturation status was decreasing quite a bit and patient actually became [bradycardic],” that
Patient A “was almost about to crash due to respiratory distress,” and that Patient A “became
cyanotic as well.”

15. Cyanosis is typically evident at oxygen saturation levels of 85% or less, and brain
injury typically occurs when oxygen saturation levels are 80% or less for more than a few
moments. Despite Patient A suffering both of these conditions, in his anesthesia record of the
August 23, 2015, procedure, Respondent did not record an oxygen saturation rate below 87%.

16. In his anesthesia record of the August 23, 2015, procedure, Respondent failed to
document Patient A’s levels of hypoxia, bradycardia, or cyanosis.

17. In his anesthesia record of the August 23, 2015, procedure, Respondent failed to
document his management of Patient A’s airway during the tracheostomy attempts or any attempts
he made to mitigate the critical problems Patient A was experiencing.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) — Malpractice

18. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

19. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating

20. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

21. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances by failing to properly assess Patient A’s health or make appropriate

and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

25. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A by failing to accurately record her oxygen levels; failing to
document her levels of hypoxia, bradycardia, and cyanosis; and failing to document how he
managed her airway during her procedure on or about August 23, 2015.

26. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
