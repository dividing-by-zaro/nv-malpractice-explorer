In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No, 23-28365-2

Against: FILED
BARRY JAMES RIVES, M.D,

Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Jan J. Cumings, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having
a reasonable basis to believe that Barry James Rives, M.D., (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10642). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on September 16, 2003. Respondent's specialty is listed as
general surgery and abdominal surgery on the Board’s website.

2. Patient A? was a fifty-three (53) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. Patient A previously had a hernia that had been repaired in 2014 with mesh.

4. On July 3, 2015, Patient A presented to Respondent for a laparoscopic reduction
and repair of a recurrent incarcerated incisional hernia.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Chair, Aury Nagy,
M.D., and Michael C. Edwards, M.D., FACS.

2 Patient A's true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint

5. Respondent's operative note documented significant adhesion of the transverse
colon to the mesh utilized in the previous hernia repair. Respondent elected to continue operating
laparoscopically and utilized a LigaSure device to extract the transverse colon from the mesh,
causing at least two (2) colotomies (incisions in the intestine).

6. Despite two (2) confirmed colotomies, Respondent did not convert the laparoscopic
surgery to an open surgery and attempted to repair the damage with a gastrointestinal anastomosis.
(GIA) stapler.

7. On or about July 4, 2015, Patient A’s condition worsened, and she was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a high white blood cell count.

8. On or about July 5, 2015, Patient A continued to deteriorate, and required
intubation. A computed tomography (CT) scan of Patient A’s abdomen did not show any blockage
of the lungs. Respondent failed to document a reason for the patient’s worsening condition and
elected not to take Patient A back into surgery for re-exploration to determine if there was any
additional bowel perforations, despite two (2) confirmed colotomies during the July 3, 2015,
laparoscopic hernia repair.

9. From on or about July 6, 2015, until on or about July 8, 2015, Respondent
continued to document examinations of the patient but failed to mention any post-surgical
complications or sepsis.

10. On July 9, 2015, Respondent documented that the Patient did not have signs or!
symptoms of sepsis. Patient A’s family sought a second opinion from another surgeon who
advised there was a possible leak from one or both of the colotomies and recommended a
diagnostic laparoscopic exploration.

11. On July 10, 2015, Respondent maintained his opinion that there was no sign of leak
or sepsis and failed to address the second opinion in the medical record.

12. On July 14, 2015, Respondent documented that Patient A had an elevated fever,
elevated white blood cell count, and ordered a repeat CT. Respondent did not elect to surgically
intervene despite Patient A’s worsening condition. The CT scan demonstrated free air and fluid

outside of the bowel, confirming a bowel leak.
