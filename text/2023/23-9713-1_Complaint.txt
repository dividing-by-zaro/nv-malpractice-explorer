Centennial Hills Hospital and Medical Center complaining of left leg pain for about a week with
some swelling.

4. Patient A had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her right leg.


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal

5. Patient A was evaluated and examined by an APRN who diagnosed superficial
thrombophlebitis and no swelling of the left leg was noted.

Ts On February 13, 2017 at approximately 1:46 p.m., Respondent read the venous
doppler ultrasound results as “No DVT is identified.”

8. The ultrasound results were conveyed to the attending emergency department
physician who also examined the patient.

9. Based on the radiology report, the APRN’s evaluation and the attending emergency
physician’s own evaluation, Patient A was discharged to home with instructions to see her primary
care physician in 1-2 days.

resuscitated.
