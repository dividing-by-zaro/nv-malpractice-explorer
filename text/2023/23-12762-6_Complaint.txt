MPLAINT = °° a

The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(Board), by and through its counsel, Deonne E. Contine, General Counsel and Ian J. Cumings,

Deputy General Counsel as attorneys for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Samuel Rodolfo Chacon, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the
Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as
follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 9105). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 27, 1999, with a specialty in Obstetrics/Gynecology.

2. Patient A? was a forty-three (43) year-old female at the time of the relevant events
at issue in this Complaint.

3. On November 18, 2021, Patient A saw her family physician, Dr. Kimberly Clinite
for abnormal uterine bleeding which had been ongoing for two (2) weeks. Patient A was

concerned that her bleeding might be caused by her intrauterine device (IUD) and wished to have

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
‘Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Aury Nagy, M.D., Chairman, Nicola (Nick)
Spirtos, M.D., F.A.C.O.G., and Ms. Maggie Arias-Petrel.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

the IUD removed. There was no pelvic organ prolapse noted on a detailed pelvic examination in
the records for this appointment.

4, Dr. Clinite removed the IUD, however, the left arm broke off during extraction and
Dr. Clinite was unable to retrieve it. Thereafter, she referred Patient A to Respondent for
evaluation for removal of the retained IUD arm.

= Patient A saw Respondent on December 15, 2021. In Patient A’s intake paperwork,
she indicated that her reason for the visit was “retained IUD parts.” Similarly, Patient A identified
her chief complaint as “retained IUD arm.”

6. In Respondent’s medical record for the December 15, 2021, appointment he notes
Patient A’s chief complaints to be retained IUD, irregular bleeding, pelvic pressure and
incontinence.

rs On her New Patient Medical History form, which she completed at her
December 15, 2021, appointment, Patient A answered no to a series of questions regarding
abdominal or pelvic pain, concems regarding sex, night urination, or any bulging sensation from
her vagina.

8. Patient A answered yes to a single question on the New Patient Medical History
form regarding loss of urine. However, Respondent’s December 15, 2021, medical record does not
document any specific history of urinary incontinence nor is there any notation in the medical
records supporting that Patient A complained about stress urinary incontinence and that it
negatively impacted her quality of life.

9. Despite no documented pelvic examination, no documented history of stress
urinary incontinence, nor any documented complaint from Patient A that she suffered from
urinary incontinence, during the December 15, 2021, visit, Respondent performed a urodynamics
study? There is no documentation of consent to perform the urodynamics study in Patient A’s
medical records. Patient A was never given any results of the urodynamics study and thereafter

developed a urinary tract infection.

4 test used to help diagnose problems with urination or urinary incontinence. It
involves insertion of a catheter into the bladder and may involve an additional catheter placed in a patient's vagina or
rectum

10. The urodynamics study summary report that is included in Patient A’s medical
records contains irrational and inaccurate data, and it is not reliable for diagnostic purposes,
clinical reasoning, or clinical decision making.

11. Respondent documented that Patient A complained of pelvic pain radiating to her
back. His notes state that she would begin taking Vicodin for the pain. Even though Patient A
lives in Susanville, California, Respondent noted that he would see her, or she would be seen in
the emergency room after-hours if her pain worsened.

12. Elsewhere in Respondent's notes in the medical records of Patient A, it states “She
will start her Vicodin which was prescribed today and may take before surgery if sig [sic] pelvic
pain or pressure.”

13. Respondent’s Prescriber Activity Report from the Nevada Prescription Monitoring
Program shows no prescriber activity by Respondent for Patient A on December 15, 2021, or at
any other time.

14, At the December 15, 2021, 2021 visit Respondent documented that Patient A,
“wishes to proceed with endometrial ablation in order to address cycles as she states that she has
exhausted conservative options of management.” In fact, records from that day document that
Patient A had normal cycles. Additionally, Respondent noted that Patient A “wishes to proceed
with bladder repair as she tried Kegel exercises in the past and that Patient A “wishes to proceed
with surgical options at this time.” There was no diagnosis documented at that time.

15. At the December 15, 2021, visit, although no specific diagnosis was documented in
the medical records of Patient A other than the retained IUD arm, for which she was to have a
hysteroscopy, Patient A was consented for the following additional surgical procedures:

1) salpingectomy 2) endometrial ablation; 3) sacrospinous vault suspension; 4) enterocele repair;
5) cystoscopy; 6) perineoplasty; 7) mid-urethral sling; and 8) any additional necessary procedures.

16. Respondent documented a pelvic examination of Patient A only in the preoperative
history which was written and dictated in the early evening of December 15, 2021, after the
appointment with Patient A had taken place and after the surgical procedure had been planned and

Patient A had consented.

17. All surgical procedures were scheduled for January 6, 2022, at Renown Regional
Medical Center.

18. Prior to the January 6, 2022, appointment, Patient A canceled her scheduled
surgeries with Respondent.

19. On January 4, 2022, Patient A saw a different OB/GYN physician (“second
OB/GYN”) regarding removal of the retained IUD and possible tubal ligation. General history
notes from her January 4, 2022, appointment state that Patient A had no other complaints and she
reported regular monthly cycles and no pelvic pain or pressure.

20. On January 20, 2022, Patient A saw the second OB/GYN where it was documented
that she reported normal menses and no pelvic pain or pressure. Patient A indicated her desire to
proceed with a bilateral laparoscopic salpingectomy and the hysteroscopy to remove the retained
IUD arm and had consented to those surgical procedures during the January 20, 2022,
appointment.
