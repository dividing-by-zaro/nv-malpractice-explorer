COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Deonne E. Contine, General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that David Kayle McCleve, PA-C, (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

lL. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician assistant holding
an active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. PA1526). Respondent
was originally licensed by the Board on August 14, 2014.

2. At all times relative to this Complaint Schon Colby Roberts (NV License No. 17176)
was Respondent’s supervising physician. Dr. Roberts was originally licensed by the Board on
July 1, 2017. Dr. Roberts’s specialty is listed as Emergency Medicine on the Board’s website.
Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery are not specialties of Emergency Medicine.

3. Dr. Roberts’s training in liposuction is limited to a two (2) day course in tumescent
liposuction offered by Inspiring Physicians Worldwide and a certificate from a liposuction master

class offered by Elite Medical, a company which, upon information and belief, no longer exists.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Aury Nagy, M.D., Nicole (Nick) M. Spirtos,
M.D.,F.A.C.O.G., and Ms. Maggie Arias-Petrel.

4. Upon information and belief, Dr. Roberts did not perform liposuction surgery and
delegated liposuction procedures to Respondent during the period he was Respondent’s supervising
physician.

5. Respondent's training in liposuction is limited to a two (2) day course in tumescent
liposuction offered by Inspiring Physicians Worldwide and a certificate from a liposuction master
class offered by Elite Medical, a company which, upon information and belief, no longer exists.

6. Respondent, as a physician assistant, has no formal surgical training in plastic or
cosmetic surgery and is not board certified in any specialty.

7. Respondent has had eight (8) supervising physicians since August 14, 2014, none of
whom have formal surgical training in plastic or cosmetic surgery, nor have they ever been board
certified in either of those specialty areas. According to the Board’s website, their specialties
include seven (7) with Emergency Medicine, one (1) with Internal Medicine.

8. Patient A? was a sixty-two (62) year-old female at the time of the events in this
Complaint.

9. Respondent saw Patient A at MyShape Lipo for the first time on
March 4, 2022, when she presented for liposuction surgery.

10. It appears that Patient A completed a packet of preprinted forms on her arrival for
her appointment on March 4, 2022. On her Patient Information form, Patient A indicated her past
medical history included hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. She also indicated that she had
two (2) prior liposuction surgeries. Under the Family History section, Patient A noted a family
history of hypertension.

11. Respondent’s records are preprinted and highly templated. Respondent uses the
Liposuction Procedure Report form to report, among other things, a patient’s allergies,
medications used, whether the patient is pregnant, vital signs, lidocaine, aspirate, and the lipo laser
areas treated.

12. This preprinted form also seems to have a templated narrative that is used on all

Liposuction Procedure Reports.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

13. The medical records lack documentation on Patient A’s blood pressure prior to or
during her liposuction surgery.

preoperative antibiotics or given any post operative instructions prior to March 4, 2022.

15. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not see Patient A preoperatively to
assess any preoperative medical conditions, obtain preoperative labs or perform a preoperative

were requested to be filled by Respondent.
