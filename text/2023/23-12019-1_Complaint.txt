4. In pertinent part, the Pharmacy Board Accusation alleged that Respondent
authorized and permitted the practice manager at Bright Futures, who was not a licensed
practitioner, to purchase, access, store, possess, furnish, and/or dispense dangerous drugs, and
permitted unrestricted and unsecured access to Respondent’s stock of dangerous drugs at Bright
Futures.

5. The Pharmacy Board Accusation also alleged that Respondent authorized and
permitted the practice manager to furnish and/or dispense dangerous drugs to persons with whom
Respondent had no direct contact, did not examine, had not established a bona fide therapeutic
relationship, and for whom Respondent had neither diagnosed or determined that a dangerous
drug was medically necessary.

permitted the practice manager to furnish and/or dispense dangerous drugs to persons without a
prescription, and that Respondent authorized and permitted the practice manager to furnish and/or
dispense dangerous drugs to persons through his practice at Bright Futures without a valid
dispensing practitioner registration.

7. On or about September 10, 2021, Respondent and the Pharmacy Board entered into
a “Stipulation and Order” (Pharmacy Board Stipulation), hereto attached as Exhibit 1, whereby
Respondent admitted evidence existed and that Pharmacy Board counsel “could present such
evidence at an administrative hearing to establish a factual basis” for violations against him.

8. Respondent accepted the Pharmacy Board Stipulation “as a public reprimand
regarding his duties and responsibilities as a practitioner,” and agreed to pay a fine and also to

reimburse the Pharmacy Board for a portion of the costs incurred in investigating and prosecuting

the matter.
