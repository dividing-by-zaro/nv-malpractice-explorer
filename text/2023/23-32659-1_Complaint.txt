MEDI! EXAMINERS
By:

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Brandee Mooneyhan, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Scott Richard Ferguson, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 12291). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on June 1, 2007.

2. Patient A was a forty-six (46) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.
Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On the morning of December 4, 2017, Patient A traveled by ambulance to the
emergency room at St. Rose Dominican Hospital-Siena Campus (St. Rose) in Las Vegas, Nevada.
At the emergency room, Patient A complained of extreme leg pain, noting that both of her legs

had been severely cramping for at least an hour, and that both legs were swollen.

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Michael C. Edwards,

M.D., and Aury Nagy, M.D.

13.

4. Respondent was the admitting physician for Patient A’s emergency room visit.

5. The standard of care for a physician in an emergency department evaluating
extremity pain requires, in part, an examination for signs of ischemia, which is a “[IJack of blood
supply to a part of the body” and “may cause tissue damage due to the lack of oxygen and

nutrients.”

6. An examination for signs of ischemia would entail a physical examination of the
patient’s skin, for factors such as temperature, color, and capillary refill, and a neurovascular
examination, which would include evaluation of the quality and character of the peripheral pulses
in the affected extremities.

7. In addition to consistently complaining of leg pain, Patient A was exhibiting what
Respondent characterized as “bizarre behavior,” including “screaming,” “thr[owing] herself on the
ground” more than once and attempting to drink directly from the faucet of a sink.

8. In an apparent effort to calm Patient A and facilitate examination and treatment,
she was administered pain medication, antipsychotic medication, and benzodiazepines while
under Respondent’s care.

9. Respondent ultimately concluded that Patient A was suffering from a “brief
psychosis,” arranged for her to undergo a psychiatric examination, and placed her on a mental
health crisis hold pursuant to NRS 433A.160.

10. While acute psychosis can be life-threatening and should be emergently addressed,
Respondent failed to also adequately address Patient A’s other potentially emergent issue of
extreme leg pain by failing to examine her legs for signs of ischemia.

11. In pertinent part, while Respondent noted that he examined Patient A’s extremities
for edema and strength, he failed to document that he examined Patient A’s legs for signs of
ischemia by performing a physical examination of the skin on her legs or a neurovascular
examination of her legs.

circumstances.”

15. In failing to examine Patient A’s legs for signs of ischemia by conducting a
physical examination of the skin of the patient’s legs and/or a neurovascular examination of her
legs, Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under
similar circumstances when rendering medical services to Patient A.

16. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:
