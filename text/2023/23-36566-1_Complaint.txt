on the Board’s website. Plastic and Cosmetic surgery are not specialties of Orthopedic Surgery or
Sports Medicine.

5. Dr. Bowman’s training in liposuction surgery is limited to a two (2) day course in
liposuction and fat transfer offered by the International Society of Cosmetogynecology (ISCG).

6. Upon information and belief, Dr. Bowman did not perform liposuction surgery and
delegated all liposuction procedures to Respondent during the time he was Respondent’s
supervising physician.

7. Respondent completed basic training in liposuction through a two (2) day course in
liposuction and fat transfer offered by the ISCG.

8. Respondent, as a physician assistant, has no other formal surgical training in plastic
or cosmetic surgery and is not board certified in any specialty.

9. Respondent has had seven (7) supervising physicians since May 12, 2010.
According to the Board’s website, their specialties include Emergency Medicine, Internal
Medicine/Cardiovascular Diseases and Family Practice.

10. Patient A? was a thirty-six (36) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

11. | Some time prior to November 12, 2020, Patient A contacted Respondent to
schedule liposuction surgery on her pubic area.

12. Respondent saw Patient A at MyShape Lipo on
November 12, 2020, when she had a scheduled appointment for her liposuction surgery on her
pubic area. When she arrived for her appointment, Patient A advised that she would also like
liposuction surgery on her abdomen, which Respondent accommodated on that day.

13. It appears that Patient A completed a packet of preprinted forms on her arrival for
her appointment on November 12, 2020. On her Patient Information form, Patient A indicated that
she weighed two hundred seventy (270) pounds and had previous gastric sleeve surgery.

14. | Measurements taken just prior to the surgery on November 12, 2020, which appear
to be taken by Respondent’s medical assistant, show “48” Upper Abdomen, 51” Belly Button, 51”

Lower Abdomen/Hips and 49” Circumference Around Butt and a garment size of 3 Large”.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy but is disclosed in the Patient

15.  Respondent’s medical records lack any documentation that Respondent discussed
Patient A’s medical history with her or otherwise evaluated whether Patient A was an appropriate
candidate for liposuction surgery.

16. Upon information and belief, Respondent never discussed Patient A’s medical
history with her or otherwise evaluated whether Patient A was an appropriate candidate for
liposuction surgery.

17. Respondent’s medical records lack documentation of any preoperative
appointments or consultations with Patient A.

18. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not have any preoperative
appointments or consultations with Patient A.

19.  Respondent’s medical records lack any documentation of any preoperative lab
work ordered for Patient A.

for Patient A.

21.  Respondent’s medical records lack any documentation that Respondent prescribed
preoperative antibiotics for Patient A.

22. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not prescribe Patient A any
preoperative antibiotics.

23. Respondent performed liposuction surgery on Patient A using tumescent anesthesia
for each of the liposuction areas and acted as both surgeon and anesthesiologist during Patient A’s
surgery.

24. The only narrative in Respondent’s medical records specifically related to
Patient A is confined to the Practitioner’s Notes Form and is largely illegible.

25. Respondent Practitioner’s Notes were deciphered to illuminate that Patient A did
well and that the surgery was well tolerated. It also notes that loose skin was discussed.

26. Respondent uses the Liposuction Procedure Report form to report a patient’s
allergies, medications used, whether the patient is pregnant, vital signs, lidocaine, aspirate, and the

lipo laser areas treated. This preprinted form also seems to have a standard narrative that is used
on all Liposuction Procedure Reports.

27. The medical records lack documentation on Patient A’s blood pressure during her
liposuction surgery.

28.  Respondent’s medical records lack documentation on the medications that were
used during the liposuction surgery.

surgery and that no pain medications were prescribed due to an oxycodone prescription ordered
for Patient A from a different provider on October 28, 2020.

30.  Respondent’s medical records lack documentation of Respondent’s post operative
evaluation or care for Patient A.

31. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not provide post operative evaluation
or care for Patient A.

32. Notes which seem to be taken by various members of Respondent’s staff start the
day after Patient A’s liposuction surgery.

33. On November 13, 2020, the note states that Patient A indicated that she was
experiencing nausea and heartburn the day after the procedure.

34. On November 16, 2020, the note states that Patient A was upset about the price of
the procedure and that she had to hire someone to take care of her during recovery from the
surgery.

35. On November 18, 2020, it appears that Patient A was notified that she was
erroneously overcharged and would be refunded five hundred dollars ($500). It also indicates she
would receive five (5) free presso treatments because she was struggling with swelling.

36. Notes further document that on November 23, 2020, Patient A came in for presso
therapy and state she was in a lot of pain and nauseous all the time.

37. On December 3, 2020, a staff note includes that Patient A communicated a foul
odor coming from her lower abdomen. She indicated that she was still draining fluid and using

gauze over the wound. Staff recommend that she discontinue doing so and wash area thoroughly.
