1, Introduction

This matter was heard in the Reno office of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(the “Board”) on August 17, 2022. Present were Ian Cumings, J.D. on behalf of the Investigative
Committee (the “IC”), Respondent Dietrich Von Feldmann, M.D. (“Respondent”) representing,
himself, and the undersigned hearing officer. The IC submitted exhibits 1-20, which were
admitted by stipulation. Appearing on behalf of the IC was David Shih, M.D. who was properly
sworn as was Respondent who testified on his own behalf. No other witnesses were called.

2, Allegations

The Complaint alleges a single count of ‘Malpractice, a violation of NRS 630.301(4),
which is premised upon the allegation that Respondent failed to order an immediate abdominal
radiograph to exclude the possibility of colon perforation when Patient A, an 80 year old male;

Cc eran awn

RBBBERESSSERRARTBEEES


complained of severe pain on June 20, 2018, after a colonoscopy performed by Respondent, IC
Exhibit 1. The malpractice claim further alleges that Respondent failed to recognize and
appreciate the gravity of the free air in Patient A’s right upper quadrant, which suggested a colon
perforation and warranted immediate surgical evaluation. Id, No answer was filed by Respondent
although Respondent denied the allegations by way of his hearing testimony.

3. Witnesses and Testimony

In support of the IC allegations, the IC called David Shih, M.D. Dr. Shih testified as to his
credentials, which are partially reflected in IC Exhibit 18. Transcript of Hearing Proceedings
(“TR”), pp. 10-13, Dr. Shih was then directed to the circumstances underlying the Complaint
with regard to which he testified that, based upon his review of the medical records provided by
the IC, Respondent “did not act upon the standard of care.” TR pp. 14-15. In so concluding, Dr.
Shih testified as to the medical records, which he indicated provide as follows.

Patient A saw Respondent for a colonoscopy on June 20, 2018, at which time Respondent
“found there were a cecal polyp, an ascending colon polyp, and a marked left-sided
diverticulosis.” TR pp. 15-16. According to the medical records, per Dr. Shih, Respondent
removed the polyps via a procedure called endoscopic mucosal resection, one complication of
which is perforation. TR 16-17. Dr. Shih described the procedure as entailing the injection of a
solution to raise the polyp, after which a snare, coupled with electrocautery, is utilized. TR 16.
The site, as treated by Respondent, was then subject to a hot biopsy with forceps where the polyp
was not already completely removed. Id.

The medical records indicate that during the evening following the procedure, Patient A
was suffering from abdominal pain that prompted a call to the hospital. TR 18, Respondent
prescribed analgesics based upon the belief that Pationt A had post polypectomy coagulation
necrosis syndrome. Id, According to Dr. Shih, Patient A’s complaint should have triggered an
order by Respondent for abdominal imaging, which Respondent failed to order. TR 19.

The following morning, June 21, 2018, Patient A presented at an emergency room anda
CT scan was ordered by another physician, TR 20. The CT scan showed a large amount of free
air in Patient A’s upper right quadrant and a few foci of gas in the porta hepatitis. The transverse

Cea Awe ew»

iu
a


colon was also mildly dilated, diverticulitis was evident, and there was also evidence of a cyst,
TR21. Per Dr. Shih, the presence of the free air would not typically be seen and is most
indicative of a bowel perforation, which could be life threatening and lend itself to fecal leakage
that could cause sepsis. TR 21-22,

Per Dr. Shih’s review of the medical records, Respondent reviewed the CT and maintained
that the free air was attributable to post polypectomy coagulation necrosis syndrome; however,
Dr. Shih was repeatedly adamant that “[bJy definition, there is no free air in the condition called
post polypectomy coagulation syndrome.” TR 22. The free air, according to Dr. Shih,
distinguished post polypectomy coagulation syndrome from a bowel perforation, in that a bowel
perforation causes free air whereas there is no free air in post polypectomy coagulation syndrome.
TR 22-23.

Noting the free air as shown from the CT scan, it was Respondent’s suggestion that a
needle be placed in Patient A’s abdomen to release the air, which, according to Dr, Shih, is not
appropriate, TR_24, The medical records also indicate that Respondent had considered a
gastrografin enema, which, according to Dr. Shih, could worsen a perforation, TR 24-25. What
should instead have been done, according to Dr. Shih, was an urgent surgical consultation. TR
25.

Suspecting a bowel perforation, the then treating physician ordered a surgical consult. TR
25-28. TR 29-30. The surgeon ultimately removed the right colon due to damage from massive
distension and extensive air within the soft tissue surrounding the colon that the right colon could
not recover from. Id. Part of Patient A’s omentum also needed to be removed due to the
perforation. Id.

Dr. Shih opined that he believed Patient A would not have survived absent the surgery and
was adamant throughout his testimony thet, when Patient A reached out post procedure,
Respondent should have directed Patient A to immediately go to urgent care or an emergency
room to address the likelihood of a perforation, TR 31-32. According to Dr. Shih, Respondent’s
failure to do so was below the standard of care and constituted malpractice. TR 32.

Cert ananawn

BRRRRRBBESSREVTARARBEEES

Respondent questioned Dr. Shih, touching upon Dr. Shih’s educational timeline predating
his residency (TR 33-34); the number of colonoscopies Dr. Shih has performed (TR 35); and how
Dr. Shih would have treated Patient A, as to which Dr. Shih testified that he would not have done
a hot biopsy touchup as it increases the risk of perforation and that he would have attributed the
post-procedure complaints to a perforation (TR 35-36, 43), Dr. Shih was also clear that he would
not have ordered a gastrografin enema and that it would be “contra” to do so in that it could
exacerbate a tear. TR 37-38, 41.

On redirect, Dr. Shih reiterated his experience with post coagulation necrosis syndrome
and the number of colonoscopies he has performed both solo and with fellows. TR 38-40. Dr.
Shih also reiterated that when there is a complaint of pain after a colonoscopy, abdominal imaging
should be undertaken. TR 40.

Respondent was permitted recross, during which Dr, Shih noted that the surgeon described
a serosal tear, indicating that the tear was complete through the colon wall from the inside of the
colon wall through the outside of the colon wall. TR 42-43, At nine (9) centimeters, Dr. Shih
described the tear as big and complete. Id.

The IC rested its case, after which Respondent testified on his own behalf. Respondent
was adamant that he believed Patient A was suffering from post coagulation necrosis syndrome
and that he would not have ordered a surgical consult. TR 45, Respondent believes that there was
only a superficial tear (which he called a “cat scratch"), from which air was permitted to escape
via micro perforations, and that Patient A could have been treated with antibiotics and pain
medication, with the needle procedure to relieve the free air. TR 45-49, 52-53, 63-66. According
to Respondent, he did not believe the surgeon’s perforation determination because the surgeon did
not note fecal spillage (as opposed to the pathologist who did). TR 48-49, Respondent also did
not believe Patient A with regard to the pain level reported by Patient A given that Patient A ate
cookie; Respondent believed Patient A slept through the night or at least stayed home through the
night and did not go to the emergency room until next day (TR 49, 57-58); and Respondent noted
that Patient A had a history of abdominal pain (TR 59-60). Respondent also did not believe that
the perforation described by the surgeon had anything to do with Patient A’s symptoms and

ec earawawrn

» moe
SSeRDRREBRBEREES

a

continued to assert that the colon injury was superficial, TR 55, Respondent further testified that
he thinks that there was no perforation when Patient A was transported to Renown by Care Flight,
which he claimed was supported by the pathology report, which is Exhibit 17. TR 60, 62. Under
cross-examination, Respondent continued to maintain that Patient A was suffering from post
coagulation necrosis syndrome and not a perforation. TR 67-68.

The IC called Dr. Shih in rebuttal. Dr. Shih reiterated that the distinction between post
polypectomy coagulation syndrome and a perforation is free air— free air indicating a perforation
—and that the surgeon documented a tear and that the pathologist documented was transmural,
meaning that the tear had gone through the whole bowel wall of the colon, TR 70, 74-76, 79-80,
82, Dr. Shih further reiterated that the most likely source of the free air in Patient A’s upper right
quadrant was due to either the endoscopic mucosal resection or the hot biopsy forceps, TR 72.
Dr. Shih also took issue with Respondent’s claim that the surgeon’s failure to note fecal spillage
countered the surgeon’s finding of a tear given the fact that Patient A hed not eaten in preparation
for the colonoscopy performed by Respondent, preparation noted as adequate for the procedure;
and, therefore, the two pieces of crackers that Patient A had eaten would not have rendered
sufficient bowel content to extravasate, TR 72-81. To the extent fecal matter was addressed on
the pathology report, Dr. Shih testified that it supports that there was a perforation with leakage
otherwise it would not have been noted as present and, therefore, Respondent's reliance upon the
pathology report is misguided. TR 81, 88.

4. Findings
Given the pain as reported by Patient A, the noted free air, the surgical intervention, the

resulting surgical procedure, and the pathology report, there can be no doubt that Patient A was
suffering from a colon perforation and that Respondent should have considered the likely chance
of a perforation as opposed to being committed to an erroneous conclusion that Patient A was
suffering from post coagulation necrosis syndrome, To discard the intervention of other
physicians who recognized the issue and to disregard their conclusions upon such intervention,

which is what one would have to do to accept Respondent's position as raised in his defense, is
unreasonable, Even in light of the medical records reflecting the perforation and the explanation


RBBBEREBSRERTRAREBESES


thereof by Dr. Shih, Respondent remained adamant that he would not have considered the
possibility of a perforation nor ordered a surgical consult, specifically stating at the close of the
proceedings “I would have done everything the same way if] would have a case like that again.”
TR99.

5. Recommendation
For the reasons set forth above, inclusive of the credible testimony provided by Dr. Shih, I

find that the IC met its burden of proof in relation to Count 1 of the Complaint against Respondent
(the only count alleged), and I respectfully recommend that the Board confirm that Respondent
committed malpractice as sct forth in the Complaint.
