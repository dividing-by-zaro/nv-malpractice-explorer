OMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Stephanie Ann Shibata, PA-C (Respondent) violated the

Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relevant to this Complaint a physician assistant holding
an active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. PA1480). Respondent
was originally licensed by the Board on December 16, 2013.

2. Patient A? was a twenty-five (25) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. Patient A was hospitalized and diagnosed with a shoulder abscess with
osteomyelitis, deep vein thrombosis, and sickle cell crisis.

4. On January 22, 2019, Patient A was discharged from the hospital with plans to
have home healthcare check on Patient A, draw and monitor regular labs, and to assist with

administration of antibiotics.

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Chowdhury H_ Ahsan,

5. Patient A’s records from her hospital visit show that her potassium level were
within normal range.

6. Additionally, as part of Patient A’s post-discharge plan, Patient A was to be
examined by physicians or physician assistants at the Clinical Infectious Disease Specialists
(CIDS) Clinic. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Respondent was employed by CIDS as a
physician assistant.

7 On February 4, 2019, a visiting nurse drew blood from Patient A at Patient A’s
home. On February 5, 2019, lab results were obtained and showed that Patient A had critical
laboratory levels showing a high potassium level of 7.4 mEq/L, indicating hyperkalemia. The lab
results were faxed to CIDS on February 6, 2019.

8. Hyperkalemia is defined as an elevated potassium level greater than 5-5.5 mEq/L.
Any acute potassium level greater than 6 mEq/L is considered clinically significant.

9. On February 11, 2019, Patient A presented to CIDS Clinic and was seen by
Respondent. Respondent reviewed the laboratory results from February 5, 2019, with Patient A.

10. Respondent's original clinic notes from February 11, 2019, do not mention
Patient A’s abnormal potassium level nor do they document that Respondent spoke to Patient A
about the abnormal potassium level.

11, Respondent's medical records from February 11, 2019, do not indicate that
Respondent ordered or recommended an electrocardiogram (EKG), to determine any cardiac
changes in Patient A as a result of Patient A’s acute elevation of potassium.

12. Respondent's medical records from February 11, 2019, further do not mdicate that
Respondent ordered or recommended immediate repeat testing of Patient A’s potassium levels, to
determine the accuracy of Patient A’s labs and to exclude the possibility of pseudohyperkalemia.

13. On or about February 11, 2019, a visiting nurse once again drew Patient A’s blood.
Lab results were obtained from Patient A, showing high potassium levels of greater than 8 mEq/L.
CIDS received the lab results on or about February 13, 2019.

14. On February 13, 2019, Patient A passed away after suffering cardiopulmonary

arrest.
