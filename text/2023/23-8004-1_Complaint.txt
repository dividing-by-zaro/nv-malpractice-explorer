COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Deonne E. Contine, General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that John Michael Bowman, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relevant to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 4945). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on January 7, 1984.

2. Respondent’s specialties are listed as Orthopedic Surgery and Sports Medicine on
the Board’s website. Plastic and Cosmetic surgery are not specialties of Orthopedic Surgery or
Sports Medicine.

3. Respondent was at all times relevant to this Complaint the supervising physician
responsible for the medical services provided by Trevor Schmidt, PA-C (License No. PA1219)
(Schmidt), a physician assistant licensed by the Board.


! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Victor M. Muro, M.D., Aury Nagy, MLD., and
Ms. Maggie Arias-Petrel.

4. Pursuant to a formal notice of supervision provided to the Board on or about
May 25, 2018, and filed in accord with NAC 630.360(4), Respondent certified that he had read and
was aware of all provisions of NRS Chapter 630 and NAC Chapter 630 concerning his duties and
professional responsibilities as a physician supervising Schmidt.

5. Respondent’s supervision of Schmidt terminated on May 18, 2021, after the dates
relevant to this Complaint.

6. At all times relevant to this Complaint, as Schmidt’s supervising physician,
Respondent was responsible for all the medical services of Schmidt.

7. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Schmidt was considered to be and was
deemed the agent of Respondent in the performance of all medical services.

8. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Schmidt was the owner and operator of
MyShape Lipo.

9. At all times relevant to this Complaint Schmidt was performing liposuction surgery
at MyShape Lipo.

10.  Respondent’s training in liposuction surgery is limited to a two (2) day course in
liposuction and fat transfer offered by the International Society of Cosmetogynecology (ISCG).

11. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not perform liposuction surgery and
delegated all liposuction surgeries to Schmidt during the time he was Schmidt’s supervising
physician.

12. Patient A? was a thirty-six (36) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

13. Some time prior to November 12, 2020, Patient A contacted Schmidt to schedule
liposuction surgery at or near her pubic area.

14, Schmidt saw Patient A at MyShape Lipo on November 12, 2020, when she had a
scheduled appointment for her liposuction surgery at her pubic area. When she arrived for her
appointment, Patient A advised that she would also like liposuction surgery on her abdomen,
which Schmidt accommodated on that day.


2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Schmidt along with a copy of this Complaint.

15. It appears that Patient A completed a packet of preprinted forms on her arrival for
her appointment on November 12, 2020. On her Patient Information form, Patient A indicated that
she weighed two hundred seventy (270) pounds and had previous gastric sleeve surgery.

16. | Measurements taken just prior to the surgery on November 12, 2020, which appear
to be taken by Schmidt’s medical assistant, show 48” Upper Abdomen, 51” Belly Button, 51”
Lower Abdomen/Hips and 49” Circumference Around Butt and a garment size of 3 Large.

17. Schmidt’s medical records lack any documentation that Schmidt discussed
Patient A’s medical history with her or otherwise evaluated whether Patient A was an appropriate
candidate for liposuction surgery.

18. Upon information and belief, Schmidt never discussed Patient A’s medical history
with her or otherwise evaluated whether Patient A was an appropriate candidate for liposuction
surgery.

19.  Schmidt’s medical records lack documentation of any preoperative appointments or
consultations with Patient A.

20. Upon information and belief, Schmidt did not have any preoperative appointments
or consultations with Patient A.

21.  Schmidt’s medical records lack any documentation of any preoperative lab work
ordered for Patient A.

22. Upon information and belief, Schmidt did not order any preoperative lab work for
Patient A.

23.  Schmidt’s medical records lack any documentation that Schmidt prescribed
preoperative antibiotics for Patient A.

24. Upon information and belief, Schmidt did not prescribe Patient A any preoperative
antibiotics.

25. Schmidt performed liposuction surgery on Patient A using tumescent anesthesia for
each of the liposuction areas and acted as both surgeon and anesthesiologist during Patient A’s
surgery.

26. The only narrative in Schmidt’s medical records specifically related to
Patient A is confined to the Practitioner’s Notes Form and is largely illegible.

27. Schmidt Practitioner’s Notes were deciphered to illuminate that Patient A did well
and that the surgery was well tolerated. It also notes that loose skin was discussed.

28. Schmidt uses the Liposuction Procedure Report form to report a patient’s allergies,
medications used, whether the patient is pregnant, vital signs, lidocaine, aspirate, and the lipo laser
areas treated. This preprinted form also seems to have a standard narrative that is used on all
Liposuction Procedure Reports.

29. The medical records lack documentation on Patient A’s blood pressure during her
liposuction surgery.

30.  Schmidt’s medical records lack documentation on the medications that were used
during the liposuction surgery.

31. The medical records note that Patient A was prescribed antibiotics at the time of
the surgery and that no pain medications were prescribed, because an oxycodone prescription was
ordered for Patient A by a different medical provider on October 28, 2020.

32. | Schmidt’s medical records lack documentation of Schmidt’s post operative
evaluation or care for Patient A.

33. Upon information and belief, Schmidt did not provide post operative evaluation or
care for Patient A.

34. Notes which seem to be taken by various members of Schmidt’s staff start the day
after Patient A’s liposuction surgery.

35. On November 13, 2020, the note states that Patient A indicated that she was
experiencing nausea and heartburn the day after the procedure.

36. On November 16, 2020, the note states that Patient A was upset about the price of
the procedure and that she had to hire someone to take care of her during recovery from the
surgery.

37. On November 18, 2020, it appears that Patient A was notified that she was
erroneously overcharged and she would be refunded five hundred dollars ($500). It also indicates
that she would receive five (5) free presso treatments because she was struggling with swelling.

38. Notes further document that on November 23, 2020, Patient A came in for presso
therapy and state she was in a lot of pain and nauseous all the time.

39. On December 3, 2020, a staff note includes that Patient A communicated a foul
odor coming from her lower abdomen. The patient indicated that she was still draining fluid and
using gauze over the wound. Staff recommend that she discontinue doing so and wash area
thoroughly. The note also says she had finished the antibiotics that day and “seen her surgeon at
the beginning of this week.” Staff requested that she send photos to be evaluated by Schmidt. The
note also states that Patient A said she was not experiencing any symptoms of infection.

40. The final staff note related to Patient A says she was admitted to the hospital on the
evening of December 3, 2020, due to an infection. Staff noted that Patient A was diabetic and that
her vitals were unstable, and that she was not doing well.

41. It appears that Respondent initialed and dated the Liposuction Procedure Report on
December 2, 2020. However, there is no further documentation that Respondent reviewed any
other records nor provided any additional care to Patient A.

disciplinary action against a licensee.

65. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a

circumstances.”

66. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he supervised a physician assistant in procedures he does not perform himself, and because, as an
orthopedic surgeon and a sports medicine specialist, he did not perform liposuction surgeries
within his scope of practice. Additionally, the only training he received in lipo suction surgery is

provided in NRS 630.352.
