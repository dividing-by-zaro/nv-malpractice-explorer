COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Ian J. Cumings, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having
a reasonable basis to believe that Samuel Rodolfo Chacon, M.D. (Respondent) violated the

Ls Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an

originally licensed by the Board on July 27, 1999, with a specialty in Obstetrics/Gynecology.

gynecologic exam, and to establish gynecological care with complaints of consistent pelvic pain
and irregular bleeding. Patient A denied any urinary incontinence, constipation, or diarrhea.

Patient A. Respondent scheduled a follow-up appointment, documenting Patient A had failed
medical management and was considering surgical intervention.

5. Laboratory testing demonstrated Patient A’s endometrial biopsy was normal, and
negative for hyperplasia or atypia.

6. On November 27, 2019, Patient A returned for her scheduled follow-up
appointment with Respondent. Respondent documented Patient A now complained of stress
urinary incontinence and that Patient A would, “like to move forward with hysterectomy and
pelvic floor repair surgery,” and was instructed on performing Kegel exercises.

7. On January 7, 2020, Patient A presented for an outpatient visit at Renown Medical
Center (“Renown”) with Respondent. During this visit she was scheduled for surgery on January
21, 2020, for symptomatic pelvic floor relaxation. Respondent recommended: hysterectomy,
bilateral salpingectomy, native tissue repair in the form of anterior and posterior vaginal repair,
enterocele repair, perineoplasty, sacrospinous vault suspension and a transobturator tape
midurethral sling procedure. Respondent documented the reason for surgery as symptomatic
pelvic floor relaxation with associated pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and mixed urinary incontinence
symptoms with a strong type 2 urinary incontinent component as noted on urodynamic studies.

8. Respondent documented that Patient A’s urodynamic studies demonstrated type 2
stress urinary incontinence, despite no such urodynamic study ever being performed on Patient A.

9. On January 8, 2020, Patient A underwent a sonograph which demonstrated no
masses or cysts, with a small fundal fibroid.

10. Prior to the January 21, 2020, procedure, Patient A canceled her scheduled surgery
with Respondent at Renown.

11. Patient A sought a second opinion on February 7, 2020, from a different OB/GYN
physician who documented that Patient A exhibited no evidence of vaginal or bladder prolapse
and was unsure of Respondent’s indications for the recommended hysterectomy or bladder
suspension. Subsequent ultrasound testing demonstrated unremarkable findings.
