In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 23-29251-1
Against:
JASON HOWARD LASRY, M.D.,

Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Jason Howard Lasry, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows: |

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10970). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on June 7, 2004.

2. Patient A* was a three (3) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On May 9, 2020, Patient A presented to Respondent for medical care at Humboldt
General Hospital in Winnemucca, Nevada, after being bitten by a snake on her left knee earlier in
the day.

4. Upon arrival at Humboldt General Hospital, Patient A had an elevated heart rate,

indicating tachycardia. Patient A also had progressive swelling of her left leg, where two (2)

M.D., and Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.).

puncture marks were observed on her left knee and had muscle weakness in her left leg, including
the inability to move the affected leg on her own.

5. Patient A’s stay at Humboldt General Hospital totaled close to three (3) hours.
During this time, Patient A’s heart rate measured from 149 beats per minute to 154 beats per
minute, indicating continued tachycardia.

6. Respondent documented Patient A’s vital signs but did not document Patient A’s
blood pressure measurements. Respondent’s notes during Patient’s A presentation did not discuss
a recognition of Patient A’s continued tachycardia.

7. Respondent spoke with the hospitalist at Humboldt General Hospital, who
expressed preference to have Patient A transferred to another facility with a higher level of care.

8. Respondent then spoke with a physician at Renown Regional Medical Center
(Renown) in Reno, Nevada. It was then arranged to have Patient A transferred from Humboldt
General Hospital to Renown. Initially, it was decided to transport Patient A via helicopter, but
then the decision was made to transport Patient A via ground ambulance.

9. Respondent did not document that he spoke with any other physicians regarding
Patient A’s snake bite.

10. During Patient A’s entire time at Humboldt General Hospital on May 9, 2020,
Respondent elected not to provide an antivenom injection to Patient A, although the appropriate
antivenom was available at Humboldt General Hospital on the day of Patient A’s arrival.

11. The first documented blood pressure measurement on May 9, 2020, was taken by
Emergency Medical Services prior to Patient A’s departure from Humboldt General Hospital.
Patient A’s blood pressure reading was 59/40, indicating low blood pressure (hypotension).

12, Prior to transferring Patient A by ambulance, Respondent failed to administer the
appropriate antivenom, despite clear evidence of Patient A’s critical life signs and uncompensated
shock.

13. Despite clear evidence of Patient A’s medical instability, Respondent transferred
Patient A from Humboldt General Hospital to Renown via ground ambulance, whereupon

Patient A expired on May 13, 2020, as a result of the snake bite.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

14. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

LS. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

16. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

17. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, by failing to recognize hypotension and tachycardia in a
patient who had been bitten by a snake, and by failing to treat her diminishing condition, failure of
which led to Patient A’s expiration.

18. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II

NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation —
Failure to Consult

19. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

20. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

Dl NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

Don Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical

condition on May 9, 2020 and Respondent should have consulted with a medical toxicologist to

address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition and such a timely
consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and may have enhanced the quality

of medical care provided to Patient A with regard to the need for antivenom and other therapies.

23. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State

Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.
COUNT If
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Appropriate Medical Records

24. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

Ds NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

26. Respondent failed to maintain complete and proper medical records relating to the
diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to document his actions when he treated
Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete. Respondent’s
medical records were not accurate and complete by failing, on May 9, 2020, to note a recognition
of Patient A’s elevated heart rate (tachycardia), or a recognition of Patient A’s continued
tachycardia, despite treatment with IV fluids, or a recognition of Patient A’s low blood pressure
(hypotension).

Zi. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:
