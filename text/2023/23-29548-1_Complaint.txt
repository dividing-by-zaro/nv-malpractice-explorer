the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

4. The CT scan from July 4, 2020, demonstrated a left kidney tumor and enlarged
lymph nodes adjacent to the left kidney.

Se Respondent, acting as radiologist on duty at the hospital, interpreted the result of
Patient A’s CT scan from July 4, 2020, and found a mechanical small bowel obstruction.

6. Respondent did not note, at any time, Patient A’s left kidney tumor or enlarged
lymph nodes adjacent to the left kidney.

7. On or about August 4, 2021, a CT scan of Patient A’s abdomen was performed.

8. On or about September 1, 2021, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan of
Patient A’s abdomen was performed.

9. The August and September 2021 scans found there to be stable recurrent papillary
renal cell carcinoma in the left kidney and adjacent nodes.

10. Thereafter, the CT scan from August 4, 2021, and the PET scan from
September 1, 2021, were compared to the CT scan from July 4, 2020, in which it was found that
Patient A’s left kidney tumor was stable since July 4, 2020, but the lymph node had increased in
size since the July 4, 2020 CT scan.

11. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

14. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A by failing to identify and note the left kidney tumor and

enlarged lymph nodes on Patient A’s July 4, 2020 CT scan.
