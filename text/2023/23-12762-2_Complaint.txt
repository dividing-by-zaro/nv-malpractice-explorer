COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through its counsel, Deonne E. Contine, General Counsel and Ian J. Cumings,
Deputy General Counsel and attorneys for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Samuel
Rodolfo Chacon, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS)
Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical
Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 9105). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 27, 1999, with a specialty in Obstetrics/Gynecology.

2. Patient A? was a sixty-nine (69) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. Records indicate that Respondent first saw Patient A on December 28, 2018, after
referral by her primary care physician for evaluation of a six-week medical history of vaginal
discharge, at times bloody, that was not responding to antifungal or antibacterial treatment.

4. Respondent’s note states that Patient A’s chief complaint was vaginal discharge,

irregular spotting, and urinary urgency. Respondent states that Patient A had significant urinary

‘Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Aury Nagy, M.D., Chairman, Nicola (Nick)
Spirtos, M.D., F.A.C.O.G., and Ms. Maggie Arias-Petrel.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint,

urgency, that she did not feel as if she fully emptied her bladder, and that she gets up to urinate up
to three (3) times per night.

5. Respondent discussed with Patient A undergoing a Urodynamic study to assess
Patient A’s urinary incontinence. Respondent's notes document that Patient A agreed to the
testing, which was performed on December 28, 2018, during a scheduled appointment.

6. Records for the Urodynamic study description indicated mild incontinence.
However, no testing data or analysis was included in Patient A’s medical records.

7. The Assessment/Diagnosis from the December 28, 2018, appointment note
Patient A “will proceed with the evaluation of the vulvovaginal atrophy if her symptoms worsen.”

8. Respondent’s medical records from January 16, 2019, indicated results from a
vaginal ultrasound were unremarkable; nevertheless, Patient A was counseled regarding the
findings of the ultrasound and the notes stated that she would proceed with further work-up given
the concern, Patient A proceeded with a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without
contrast.

9. January 16, 2019, records also indicate that Patient A “has had one episode of}
unprotected sexual activity but had a normal cycle after the last encounter.” However, a normal
cycle is hard to imagine in any 69-year-old woman, but especially in a woman who had a
hysterectomy. The fact that she had a hysterectomy was documented in Patient A’s records on the
same page that indicated she had a normal cycle.

10. On January 24, 2019, Patient A had a follow-up appointment where she was
counseled regarding the CT scan results which were unremarkable and did not warrant further
review. At this appointment another Urodynamics study was described in Patient A’s medical
records, which noted again, that Patient A had mild incontinence. However once more, no data or
analysis regarding the urodynamic testing was included in Patient A’s medical records.

ll. The January 24, 2019, records further noted that Patient A wished to proceed with
an expectant management approach to her incontinence.

12. Seemingly in contradiction to the desire of Patient A to proceed with an expectant

management approach to her incontinence, documentation in the records for January 24, 2019,

also stated that Patient A was “no longer interested in proceeding with conservative management
and now wishes she wishes [sic] to proceed with definitive surgery to correct not only her known
pelvic floor relaxation but her [stress urinary incontinence].”

13. Respondent’s records for Patient A showed an encounter on January 31, 2019,
during which it was noted that Patient A, “was given preoperative instructions and wishes to
proceed with the pelvic floor corrective surgery on the specified date.”

14, The preoperative diagnosis or reason for surgery documentation stated
“Symptomatic pelvic floor relaxation, pelvic pain, mixed urinary incontinence with strong type 2
stress urinary incontinent component as noted on urodynamic studies.”

15. However, no documentation noting any objective finding of symptomatic pelvic
organ prolapse was ever recorded in Respondent’s records for Patient A, and pelvic floor related
issues were not documented at any time prior to the issue appearing in the January 31, 2019,
encounter, which was after all consents were obtained and surgery was scheduled.

16. Additionally, Patient A’s medical records do not contain results of any urodynamic
study that support a diagnosis of “mixed urinary incontinence with strong type 2 stress urinary
incontinent component.”

17. _ The only finding of prolapse in any of Patient A’s medical records related to this
issue, was of posterior prolapse documented by a colorectal surgeon, who noted
“a small rectocele” on February 7, 2019, four (4) days before Patient A’s surgery was scheduled to
take place.

18. On February 11, 2019, Patient A presented to Saint Mary’s Regional Medical
Center where records showed Respondent performed the following surgical procedures: anterior
and posterior vaginal repair, enterocele repair, perineoplasty, sacrospinous vault suspension, trans
obturator tape mid urethral sling procedures and cystoscopy. These procedures were not
performed on the basis of any documented complaints by Patient A nor any medical diagnoses.
