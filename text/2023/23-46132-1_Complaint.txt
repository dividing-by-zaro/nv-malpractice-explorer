4. Patient A’s relevant medical history was listed on the intake sheet and patient
referral.

5. On September 30, 2018, Respondent examined Patient A’s CT scan, but failed to
identify or note the existence of a conspicuous 4.4-centimeter right lateral wall soft tissue mass in
his report. Additionally, Respondent failed to identify or note an irregular right cardiophrenic
lymph node and three (3) small lung nodules which warranted further testing.

6. Patient A underwent additional diagnostic testing on July 25, 2019, which
demonstrated the presence of the soft-tissue mass.

7. Respondent’s failure to properly interpret Patient A’s CT imaging resulted in the
delay of diagnosis and treatment of recurrent metastatic cancer.

8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

9. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

10. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

11. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A by failing to identify or note the existence of a 4.4-
centimeter mass, irregular lymph node, and nodules present on the lung.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

13. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

14. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

15. Respondent failed to maintain proper medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly note the mass present on Patient A’s CT
scan.

16. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

20. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition on September 30, 2018, and Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care
provider to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition and such a
timely consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and may have enhanced the
quality of medical care provided to the Patient with regard to the presence of conspicuous masses
on the September 28, 2018 CT scan.
