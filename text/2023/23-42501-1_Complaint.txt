reasonable basis to believe that Schon Colby Roberts, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 17176). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 1, 2017.

2. Respondent’s specialty is listed as Emergency Medicine on the Board’s website.
Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery are not specialties of Emergency Medicine.

No. PA1526) (McCleve), a physician assistant licensed by the Board.

4. Pursuant to a formal notice of supervision provided to the Board on or about

read and was aware of all provisions of NRS Chapter 630 and NAC Chapter 630 concerning his
duties and professional responsibilities as a physician supervising McCleve.

5. Respondent’s supervision of McCleve terminated on May 23, 2022, after the dates
relevant to this Complaint.

6. At all times relevant to this Complaint, as McCleve’s supervising physician,
Respondent was responsible for all the medical services performed by McCleve.

7. At all times relevant to this Complaint, McCleve was considered to be and was

deemed the agent of Respondent in his performance of all medical services.

8. At all times relevant to this Complaint McCleve was performing liposuction
surgery at MyShape Lipo.
9. Respondent’s training in liposuction surgery is limited to a two (2) day course in

tumescent liposuction offered by Inspiring Physicians Worldwide and a certificate from a
liposuction master class offered by Elite Medical, a company which, upon information and belief,
no longer exists.

10. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not perform liposuction surgery and
delegated all liposuction surgeries to McCleve during the time he was McCleve’s supervising
physician.

11. Patient A? was a sixty-two (62) year-old female at the time of the events in this
Complaint.

12. | McCleve saw Patient A at MyShape Lipo for the first time on March 4, 2022, when
she presented for liposuction surgery.

13. It appears that Patient A completed a packet of preprinted forms on her arrival for
her appointment on March 4, 2022. On her Patient Information form, Patient A indicated her past
medical history included hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. She also indicated that she had
undergone two (2) prior liposuction surgeries. Under the Family History section, Patient A noted a
family history of hypertension.


2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

14. | McCleve’s records are preprinted and highly templated. Respondent uses the
Liposuction Procedure Report form to report, among other things, a patient’s allergies, current
medications used, whether the patient is pregnant, the patient’s vital signs, lidocaine used, aspirate
withdrawn, and the lipo laser areas treated.

15. This preprinted form also seems to have a templated narrative that is used on all
Liposuction Procedure Reports.

16. | The medical records lack documentation on Patient A’s blood pressure prior to or
during her liposuction surgery.

17. McCleve’s medical records lack any documentation that Patient A was evaluated
preoperatively to assess any preoperative medical conditions. There is no documentation whether
McCleve did obtained preoperative labs or whether he performed a preoperative risk assessment
to determine whether Patient A was an appropriate candidate for liposuction surgery. Finally,
there is no documentation that Patient A was prescribed preoperative antibiotics or given any post
operative instructions prior to March 4, 2022.

18. Upon information and belief, McCleve did not see Patient A preoperatively to
assess any preoperative medical conditions, obtain preoperative labs or perform a preoperative
risk assessment to determine whether Patient A was an appropriate candidate for liposuction
surgery. Finally, McCleve did not prescribe Patient A preoperative antibiotics.

19. The Liposuction Procedure Report notes that Patient A consented to the procedure
after being informed of the risks and potential complications of tumescent liposuction. McCleve’s
records lack documentation of consent to any other type of procedure.

20. The Liposuction Procedure Report shows the Smart Lipo Laser procedure was
performed.

21. Upon information and belief, Patient A did not consent to the Smart Lipo Laser
procedure.

22. The Liposuction Procedure Report indicates that Patient A was given post
operative instructions and medications. McCleve’s Practitioner Notes and Discharge Summary

indicate he told Patient A to provide her pharmacy location; however, the medical records lack

documentation regarding the medications prescribed, dose, or date the prescriptions were
requested to be filled by McCleve.

23. In a postoperative note McCleve indicated he received a call from Walmart
Pharmacy on March 6, 2022, two (2) days following Patient A’s surgery, for clarification on the
prescription order.

24.  McCleve’s postoperative medical record notes that on March 7, 2022, Respondent
spoke to an Intensive Care Unit physician at Mountain View Hospital who indicated Patient A
was in pain, hypotensive, and that Patient A likely had necrotizing fasciitis.

25. Patient A was transferred to Sunrise Hospital on March 7, 2022, where she was
confined and treated for two (2) weeks. Patient A was discharged on March 21, 2022.

COUNT I
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Appropriate Medical Records

26. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

27.  NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

28. | NAC 630.370 requires the supervising physician review and sign off on selected
medical record charts.

29. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above outlined facts, Respondent
violated NRS 630.3062(1)(a) because McCleve, his supervisee, failed to correctly document his
actions when he treated Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and
complete because Respondent and McCleve relied on preprinted, templated forms that contained a
limited narrative. Additionally, McCleve failed to document the required information and his
records contained inconsistent and incorrect information which was never corrected by
Respondent as his supervisor. Additionally, Respondent, through McCleve, failed to document
any pre or post operative care.

33. | NAC 630.360(1) permits a physician to perform only those medical services that
are within the scope of the practice of the physician.

34. Respondent violated NRS 630.306(1)(e) because the liposuction surgery performed
on Patient A, by McCleve, is not within the Respondent’s scope of practice of emergency

medicine. Additionally, Respondent does not have a specialty in cosmetic or plastic surgery.

35. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
COUNT IT
NRS 630.306(1)(e) — Practicing Beyond Scope of Training

38. | NAC 630.360(1) permits a physician to perform only those medical services that
are within the scope of the physician’s training.

39. Respondent violated NRS 630.306(1)(e) because Respondent supervised McCleve
in liposuction surgery without a specialty in cosmetic or plastic surgery and because his
liposuction surgery training was limited to, at most, three (3) days of coursework.

40. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

41.  Allof the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

42.  NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

supervising physician, Respondent was responsible for all the medical activites of McCleve and
McCleve’s malpractice is imputed to Respondent.

considered to be and was deemed the agent of Respondent in the performance of all medical
services and McCleve’s malpractice is imputed to Respondent.

45. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

46. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed

iii. conduct a risk assessment to determine if Patient A was an
appropriate candidate for liposuction surgery; and

47. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
COUNT V
NRS 630.301(4) — Malpractice

48. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

49. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

50. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

51. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he supervised a physician assistant in procedures he does not perform himself, and because, as an
emergency medicine physician, he did not perform liposuction surgeries within his scope of
practice. Additionally, the only training Respondent received in liposuction surgery is three (3)
days of programing offered by Inspiring Physicians Worldwide and a certificate from a
liposuction master class offered by Elite Medical, a company which, upon information and belief,
no longer exists.

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
9600 Gateway Drive

(775) 688-2559


55. Pursuant to NAC 630.230 it is prohibited professional conduct for a physician to
fail to provide adequate supervision of a physician assistant.

56. Respondent violated NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) by failing to provide the supervision as
required by NAC 630.370(5). Respondent has provided no documentation demonstrating
development and implementation of a program to ensure the quality of care provided by McCleve.
Respondent is not competent to develop and carry out a program to ensure the quality of care
provided by McCleve because liposuction surgery is outside the scope and training of an
emergency physician. Furthermore, Respondent has negligible training in liposuction surgery, is
not a specialist in cosmetic or plastic surgery and could not perform the duties required of him by

law and, therefore, Respondent’s supervising physician position was sinecure.

57. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
