COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through its counsel, Ian J. Cumings, Deputy General Counsel and attomey for the
IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Samuel Rodolfo Chacon, M.D., (Respondent)
violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada
Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues
its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 9105). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 27, 1999, with a specialty in Obstetrics/Gynecology.

2. Patient A? was a forty-four (44) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On February 5, 2019, Patient A presented to the emergency room following
complaints of mild cramping and dysuria (pain or difficulty urinating), where she was diagnosed
with uterine fibroids.

4. On February 6, 2019, Patient A was seen by a urologist who documented Patient A

pain, urinary urgency, abdominal pain, and dysuria without a history of trauma prior to the onset
of her symptoms.

5. On February 11, 2019, Patient A was referred by her primary care physician to
Respondent for her recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms and uterine fibroids to be
evaluated for a potential hysterectomy. Upon Patient A’s initial clinical presentation, Respondent
documented Patient A had abnormal (heavy) uterine bleeding and dysmenorthea (pelvic pain)
associated with her known uterine fibroids and agreed with Patient A to perform an endometrial
biopsy.

6. Patient A returned to Respondent on February 15, 2019, with complaints of pelvic
pain associated with menstruation. Respondent diagnosed Patient A with stress urinary
incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Respondent's records from the February 15, 2019, visit
are contradictory. Respondent documented Patient A had received Kegel exercise instructions,
and then asserts Patient A had failed conservative management with pelvic floor exercises and
wished to proceed with definitive surgical management of her pelvic pain and urodynamic stress
urinary incontinence. This visit was Patient A’s first time having received any information from
Respondent about Kegel exercises.

7. During the February 15, 2019, visit Respondent performed a urodynamics study
without clinical indication, as Patient A did not complain of stress urinary incontinence and was
referred for a consultation for a hysterectomy for her known uterine fibroids and heavy bleeding
during her menstrual cycles. Respondent diagnosed Patient A with stage two (2) uterovaginal
prolapse without a proper supporting examination or indication documented in the medical record.

8 On March 19, 2019, Respondent performed a laparoscopically assisted vaginal
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, anterior and posterior repair, enterocele repair,
perineoplasty, transobturator mid-urethral sling, and sacrospinous ligament vaginal vault
suspension, despite no clinical indication or complaints of pelvic organ prolapse.
