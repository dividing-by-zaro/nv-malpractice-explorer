filed by Respondent Oliver on June 28, 2021, requested by Respondent to be deemed the Answer

for the Amended Accusation, and upon which the Board made findings of facts, are as follows:

1. The Board has jurisdiction over Respondent and this matter.
2. Respondent Oliver owns/operates Glimpse Medical (“Glimpse”), a medicul

technician license after 2016.

5. From approximately July 1, 2019 to January 23, 2020, Racosas performed
dispensing technician duties without an active dispensing technician license.

6. Dr. Oliver permitted Racosas to be employed in the capacity of dispensing

technician at Glimpse without an active dispensing license for approximately 115 days.
