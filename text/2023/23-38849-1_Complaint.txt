COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Donald K. White, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Shannon Marie Smith, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 15407). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 1, 2014.

2. Patient A? was a fifty-three (53) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. On June 26, 2019, Patient A was referred from Canyon Medical Center to Sunrise
Hospital complaining of dizziness, weakness, fever, a fast heart rate, and shortness of breath.

4. Patient A’s past medical history included an aortic valve replacement,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking.


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Carl N. Williams, Jr.,
M.D., FACS and Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.).

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. Patient A’s clinical outlook at the emergency room was consistent with sepsis.

6. Blood cultures were drawn and Patient A was started on a medically appropriate
sepsis treatment regimen with IV fluids and IV antibiotics and was admitted to the hospital.

7. The first blood culture had a positive gram stain for gram pistive cocci in clusters.

8. On June 27, 2019, an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) was notified of
the growth and the attending physician added IV vancomycin to the treatment of Patient A.

9. Care of the patient was transferred to Respondent on June 29, 2019 and she was the
attending physician until Patient A’s discharge on June 30, 2019.

10. | An APRN wrote in a progress note on June 29, 2019 “blood cultures PCR+ Staph
aureus. Repeat blood cultures without growth thus far.” The APRN signed the note on
June 29, 2019, but was not signed by Respondent until July 3, 2019.

11. Both of the original blood cultures drawn on June 26, 2019 were reported positive
and were growing staph aureus by the time Respondent became the attending physician on
June 29, 2019.

12. Additionally, on June 29, 2019, both of the additional blood cultures drawn on
June 28, 2019 were also growing staph aureus, which was reported to an RN, who passed this
information on to another APRN.

13. On June 30, 2019, Patient A now had four (4) positive blood cultures, tachycardia,
elevated white blood cell count of sixteen thousand five hundred (16,500) (with immature
neutrophils including band forms, metamyelocytes, myelocytes, and promyelocytes).

14. Despite these significant findings, an APRN, under the direction of Respondent,
discharged Patient A with no antibiotics and attributed his severe medical condition to being
“viral” and stating the patient was “medically stable for discharge.”

15. After Patient A was discharged, his blood culture results returned positive for staph
aureus. However, between June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2019, Respondent did not follow up with
the blood culture results. In fact, Respondent stated that she expected to be called with results
from the lab.

16. Patient A was readmitted to Sunrise Hospital on July 5, 2019 with severe sepsis

and succumbed on July 7, 2019.
COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

17. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

18. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a Physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

19. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

20. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, when she did not follow up with the laboratory nor
Patient A about the blood cultures positive for staph aureus. She was then unable to provide
Patient A the appropriate treatment because the patient had been prematurely discharged from the
hospital which ultimately lead to Patient A’s demise.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation

22. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

23. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

24. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to“seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the

quality of medical services.”

25. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition from June 29-30, 2019. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care
provider. Specifically, she should have consulted with the laboratory physicians regarding the
growing blood cultures to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical
condition and such a timely consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and
may have enhanced the quality of medical care provided to the Patient with regard to Patient A’s
staph aureus growing cultures and the resulting sepsis.

26. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against her and give
her notice that she may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
