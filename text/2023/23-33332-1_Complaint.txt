5. Respondent erroneously diagnosed Patient A with right carpal tunnel syndrome,
right SLIO tear, and an avulsion fracture of the lunate.

6. Respondent recommended revision surgery and scheduled Patient A for open
reduction internal fixation of the lunate on November 12, 2019.

7. On November 5, 2019, a preoperative MRI confirmed Patient A had stage 3
scapholunate advanced collapse pattern arthritis, which requires a scaphoidectomy and midcarpal
fusion to correct.

8. On November 11, 2019, Respondent reviewed the November 5, 2019, MRI and
changed the planned surgery which had been discussed with the patient to the appropriate
procedure but failed to obtain new informed consent prior Patient A presenting for surgery on
November 12, 2019.

9. On November 12, 2019, Patient A presented for surgery. Only after the
administration of anesthesia was Patient A informed of the change in the surgical plan, and
therefore was not properly given informed consent prior to surgery being performed.

10. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A as demonstrated by the initial misdiagnosis of the patient’s

informed consent before the patient received sedation prior to performing surgery.
