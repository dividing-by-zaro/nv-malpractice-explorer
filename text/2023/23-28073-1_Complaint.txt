7. Patient E was a thirty (30) year-old female at the time of the events at issue and
was a patient of Respondent from on or about June 17, 2016, to on or about October 3, 2016.

8. Patient F was a forty (40) year-old male at the time of the events at issue and was a
patient of Respondent from on or about June 16, 2016, to on or about October 3, 2016.

9. Patient G was a thirty-five (35) year-old female at the time of the events at issue
and was a patient of Respondent from on or about June 2, 2016, to on or about October 6, 2016.

12. Eight (8) of the nine (9) patients’ records were nearly identical with regards to the
physical exam and plan sections (demonstrating a lack of individual care for each of the nine (9)
patients); Respondent occasionally prescribed methadone for all patients except Patient I as
needed for pain and oxycodone for all patients as needed for pain, which is extremely dangerous
and also demonstrates a failure to maintain proper medical records, as medical records when
compared to prescriptions show these incongruencies; there is no indication that Respondent
utilized urine drug screening to ensure compliance with the patients’ pain medications; except for
Patient H?, and Respondent documented that the other eight (8) patients had nearly identical
physical exams and diagnoses, resulting from the same straight leg tests and the FABER tests.

3 Upon information and belief, Respondent did not have access to Patient Hs medical records and therefore he did not
provide them.
