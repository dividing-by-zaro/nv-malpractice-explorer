EIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through its counsel, fan J. Cumings, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney
for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Samuel Rodolfo Chacon, M.D. (Respondent)
violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada
Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues.
its First Amended Complaint (Complaint), stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 9105). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 27, 1999, with a specialty in Obstetrics/Gynecology.

2. Patient A? was a twenty-six (26) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

ae On January 26, 2022, Patient A established care with Respondent for routine
gynecological care.

4. On September 9, 2022, Patient A was seen by a physician at Respondent's practice
who diagnosed her with a twin pregnancy via ultrasound testing and referred her to a

perinatologist at a high-risk pregnancy center for her twin pregnancy, which is classified as a

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal

high-risk pregnancy. Patient A’s pregnancy was monitored closely by the specialists at the high-
tisk pregnancy center with serial ultrasounds and testing every two (2) to three (3) weeks.

5. On November 11, 2022, when Patient A was approximately sixteen (16) weeks
pregnant, she began seeing Respondent for obstetric care following the departure of her previous
physician from Respondent's practice.

6. Respondent only held hospital privileges to deliver pregnancies at Saint Mary’s
Hospital and Renown Regional Medical Center (Renown) in Northern Nevada.

7. On November 11, 2022, Saint Mary’s Hospital closed its labor and delivery
department, leaving Respondent with only one (1) option for a hospital to deliver a pregnancy,
from that point forward, Renown.

8 On November 22, 2022, Respondent lost his hospital privileges at Renown
following a voluntary surrender of his clinical privileges while under an investigation relating to
his professional competence or his conduct.

9. On or about December 14, 2022, Patient A was contacted by a care manager from
her insurance provider about delivery options, where she was informed that Respondent did not
have hospital privileges at Renown to deliver her pregnancy. The care manager asked Patient A to
reconfirm with Respondent that he would be delivering her pregnancy at Renown.

10. On or about December 16, 2022, at Patient A’s appointment with Respondent,
Patient A was informed by Respondent that he would not be delivering her pregnancy at Renown,
but instead at Northern Nevada Medical Center. Respondent did not hold any hospital privileges
at Northern Nevada Medical Center, or any other hospital at the time he made this statement to
Patient A.

Il. On February 8, 2023, Patient A underwent ultrasound testing at the high-risk
pregnancy center which indicated Twin A was growth restricted. Following Twin A’s diagnosis
of growth restriction, Patient A was recommended to deliver sometime between thirty-six (36) and
thirty-seven (37) weeks of gestation by her perinatologist and to continue to receive ultrasound

testing every two (2) weeks to monitor her pregnancy.

12. On March 30, 2023, at thirty-six (36) weeks pregnant, Patient A underwent further
ultrasound testing that was performed by the perinatologist which demonstrated little growth of
Twin A from the previous ultrasound on March 13, 2023. The perinatologist recommended
delivery between thirty-six weeks (36) and thirty-six weeks and three days (36.3).

13. On March 30, 2023, Patient A was seen by Respondent who performed a
membrane sweep on Patient A to help induce labor. Respondent informed Patient A that if she
wanted to deliver her pregnancy at Renown, because of their neonatal care unit and because her!
twins may need a higher level of care, she should present to Renown.

14. On March 31, 2023, Patient A was seen by Respondent for a second stripping of|
her membranes following a bloody show.

15. At no time did Respondent inform Patient A that he did not have hospital privileges
at Northern Nevada Medical Center, nor any other area hospital, and thus he could not deliver her’
pregnancy.

16. Respondent failed to refer Patient A to an appropriate care provider or physician
group who could properly induce Patient A for delivery of her pregnancy, despite his knowledge
of the perinatologist’s delivery recommendation

17. On April 1, 2023, Patient A had yet to go into labor and presented to Renown for
delivery of her pregnancy within the recommended time given to her by the perinatologist.
Patient A ultimately delivered her children by cesarean section on April 2, 2023, at Renown
performed by another physician.

18. Respondent produced an informed consent form dated November 11, 2022, in
response to the IC’s Order to Produce Medical Records. This informed consent stated Patient A
was aware that Respondent did not have hospital privileges and could not deliver her pregnancy
but would merely coordinate her delivery with another provider. The printed section of the form
misspelled Patient A’s name and contained a signature which also misspelled Patient A’s name

Moreover, the signature did not match Patient A's prior signatures on any document or medical
record.

19. Patient A never signed this document nor was she aware that Respondent did not
have privileges at any hospital while under his care. Therefore, the document provided to the IC
in response to its Order to Produce Medical Records was forged.

he rendered medical services to Patient A by failing to make arrangements for Patient A’s delivery
of her high-risk twin pregnancy following the loss of his hospital privileges on
November 22, 2022. Moreover, Respondent committed malpractice by continuing to see
Patient A for obstetrical care without having a relationship with any physician or physician group

regard to Patient A’s medical condition from November 22, 2022, through April 2, 2023, to
address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition, and such a timely
consultation would have enhanced the quality of medical care provided to Patient A with regard to
the delivery of Patient A’s twin pregnancy.

34. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
