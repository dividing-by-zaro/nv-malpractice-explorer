4. Patient A saw Respondent on six (6) more occasions between April 27, 2015, and
March 21, 2016, wherein Respondent recommended sinus surgery to address Patient A’s chronic
sinusitis.

5 On March 14, 2016, Patient A underwent a Computed Tomography (CT) scan
which demonstrated clear frontal and sphenoid sinuses, mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid
air cells, a left Haller cell with osteomeatal thickening, a right concha bullosa and left nasal
septum deviation

6. On April 4, 2016, Patient A underwent a bilateral ethmoidectomy, bilateral
maxillary antrostomy, bilateral nasal polypectomy, septoplasty, and right turbinate reduction,
performed by Respondent.

7. Following the April 4, 2016, procedure, Patient A continued to develop worsening
facial pain, headaches, nasal congestion, and nasal discharge.

8. Patient A was seen by Respondent on eleven (11) occasions between
April 18, 2016, and October 4, 2016, for nasal debridement Cultures were obtained from
Patient A on September 20, 2016, and September 29, 2016, which grew abundant Staphylococcus
Aureus with no white blood cells.

9. Respondent's records for these visits were incomplete, and did not include
evaluations for chronic conditions that would require modification in management. Moreover,
Respondent failed to order appropriate CT imaging to evaluate the etiology of Patient A’s
worsening condition.

10. On October 24, 2016, Patient A sought a second opmion with another
otolaryngologist. Patient A then underwent a nasal endoscopy by this physician where it was
discovered that a foreign body was discovered in Patient A’s nasal cavity, which was determined
to be a surgical sponge left from the prior surgery, performed by Respondent, and was promptly
removed.

11. On November 21, 2016, Patient A underwent a subsequent CT scan, which
revealed a second surgical sponge retained near Patient A’s nasal septum that was overgrown by

nasal epithelium. Patient A required additional surgery to remove the retained sponge.
