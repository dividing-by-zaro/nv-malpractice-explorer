COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having
a reasonable basis to believe that Scott Thomas Gabriel, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 11590). Respondent was.
originally licensed by the Board on August 24, 2005.

2. Patient A? was a thirty (30) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On December 9, 2019, Patient A presented to a hospital with complaints of|
abdominal pain. Patient A then underwent testing, which showed evidence of gallstones, a
thickened gallbladder wall, and an inflamed gallbladder (cholecystitis).

4. On December 11, 2019, Respondent, a general surgeon, performed a minimally

invasive surgical procedure to remove Patient A's gallbladder (laparoscopic cholecystectomy).

The Investigauve Commuttee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the ume this formal
Complaint was authorized for filimg, was composed of Board members Victor M Muro, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ahsan,
M.D., Ph.D., FAC, and Ms. Pamela J Beal.

* Patient A’s true identity 1s not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but 1s disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint

5. During the procedure, Respondent noted that Patient A's gallbladder was
gangrenous. Respondent also noted that he dissected out what appeared to be the cystic duct, ie.
the duct that typically joins the gallbladder and the common hepatic duct.

6. Respondent then took x-ray imaging of the bile ducts using contrast dye
(intraoperative cholangiogram) to see the anatomy of Patient A’s bile ducts and confirm that he
dissected out the correct duct, ie. the cystic duct.

7. Upon information and belief, the cholangiogram obtained during the
December 11, 2019, procedure did not show filling of contrast dye in the right hepatic system.

8. Despite not observing the filling of the right hepatic duct, Respondent interpreted
the intraoperative cholangiogram as normal.

9. Upon information and belief, Respondent also did not document that the
intraoperative cholangiogram confirmed that the duct he dissected was Patient A’s cystic duct.

10. Respondent also did not document or note that he obtained the critical view of
safety during Patient A’s December 11, 2019, laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The critical view of
safety requires that the hepatocystic triangle is cleared of fat and fibrous tissue, the lower one third
of the gallbladder is separated from the liver to expose the cystic plate, and that only the cystic
duct and cystic artery are seen entering the gallbladder.

11. Despite not documenting that he obtained the critical view of safety and despite not
confidently identifying Patient A’s ductal anatomy via the intraoperative cholangiogram,
Respondent did not proceed with a subtotal cholecystectomy and instead proceeded with a total
cholecystectomy.

12, After interpreting the intraoperative cholangiogram as normal, Respondent
proceeded to divide what he considered to be the cystic duct and removed Patient A’s gallbladder.
At some point between obtaining the cholangiogram and removing the gallbladder, Respondent
transected Patient A’s right hepatic duct, causing a bile duct injury.

13, After removing Patient A’s gallbladder, Respondent noted bile leaking from the

liver bed, indicative of a bile duct injury, but was unable to delineate a duct directly as the source.

14. After consulting with another general surgeon intraoperatively, Respondent
decided to place a drain and wait a few days to determine the severity and extent of the bile duct
injury.

15. On December 14, 2019, further testing indicated that Patient A had a significant
bile duct injury at the level of the night hepatic duct.

16. Due to this injury following Respondent's procedure, Patient A spent three (3)
months in the hospital and required multiple subsequent corrective surgeries. She further
experienced significant complications, including bile leakage, bleeding, infection, and the need for
external bile drainage upon Patient A’s release.
