CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
L
The Board has jurisdiction over Respondent and the Complaint, and an adjudication of this
matter by the Board members as set forth herein is proper.
I.
Respondent was timely and properly served with the Complaint, and all notices and orders
in advance of the hearing and adjudication thereon, in accord with NRS and NAC Chapters 630,
NRS Chapters 241, 622A and 233B, and the requirements of due process.
Tt
With respect to the allegations of the First Amended Complaint, the Board concludes that
Respondent has violated the Medical Practice Act, as alleged in the First Amended Complaint, as
follows: one (1) count of NRS 630.301(1), Conviction of a Felony Relating to the Practice of
Medicine. Accordingly, Respondent is subject to discipline pursuant to NRS 630.352.
Iv.
The Board finds that, pursuant to NRS_ 622.400, recovery from Respondent of reasonable attorneys’
fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigation and disciplinary proceedings against
Respondent is appropriate. The Board has reviewed the Investigative Committee's Memorandum,
of Costs and Disbursements and Attorneys’ Fees; and the Board finds them to be the actual fees and
costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigative, administrative and disciplinary proceedings
against Respondent, and finds them to be reasonable and necessary based on: (I) the abilities,
training, education, experience, professional standing and skill demonstrated by Board staff and
attorneys; (2) the character of the work done, its difficulty, its intricacy, its importance, the time and
skill required, the responsibility imposed and the prominence and character of the parties where, as
in this case, they affected the importance of the litigation; (3) the work actually performed by the
Board's attorneys and staff, and the skill, time and attention given to that work; and (4) the product

of the work and benefits to the Board and the people of Nevada that were derived therefrom.

Respondent. NEVADA sTATE|BOARD OF

AI RI MEN! THE BOARD

This matter came on for formal hearing after due notice was provided to Respondent
Dr. Chung and after a number of pre-hearing conferences. Dr. Chung was convicted by a jury
in a criminal case which has significant application to this case, Dr. Chung's treatment of one
of the victims in the criminal case isthe principal subject of the Complaint and Amended
Complaint on file with the State Board of Medical Examiners in this case.

The record in this case includes a history of postponing the formal hearing at Dr.
‘Chung's repeated requests so that his habeas corpus petition in the criminal court system could
run its course. After a number of significant delays, this hearing officer determined that it was
appropriate to move forward with hearing of the Amended Complaint. That hearing occurred
‘on April 22, 2024 at the conference room in the office of the Board of Medical Examiners of
the State of Nevada (“Board”), At the outset of the hearing, Dr. Chung, appearing via
telephone from prison, and declined to participate in the hearing on advice of his criminal
counsel. Dr. Chung was advised that the hearing would occur in his absence, he
acknowledged that he understood, and terminated the call

Inasmuch as there was no opposition to the Board's case, Don White, Esq., counsel for
the Board, presented the case in summary fashion. Six (6) exhibits were admitted, including:
the criminal indictment which charged Respondent with multiple felony counts; a partial
transcript of the jury trial including testimony of the victim identified in the Board’s Amended
‘Complaint; the verdict form whereby the jury convicted Dr. ‘Chung of eleven (11) of fourteen

we ran awn

ai





(14) charged felonies; court minutes from the. ‘sentencing hearing in the criminal case; the
formal judgment of criminal conviction, and; the Nevada Supreme Court Order affirming the
appealed conviction, (It is noted that Dr. Chung's ongoing habeas corpus petition is a separate
Proceeding from the direct appeal which the Supreme Court denied.)

‘The convictions which apply directly to the instant case before the Board include
sexual assault, battery with intent to commit sexual assault, attempted sexual assault, and
kidnapping in the first degree. Dr. Chung was convicted of these charges based on facts that
he committed these criminal acts after he administered anesthesia to a patient while ostensibly
treating her for acne, and while the patient was unconscious or semi-conscious. He attempted
to hide his actions by claiming that the victim had an adverse reaction to the
medication/anesthetic. The jury which convicted Dr. Chung of these charges was required to
find him guilty beyond any and all reasonable doubt. That burden is the highest burden of
proof in American jurisprudence, and is certainly higher than the burden the Board bears in
proving the allegations in its Amended Complaint. Accordingly, this hearing officer finds that
those facts found by the jury which coincide with the facts alleged by the Board in this case,
which factual findings of the jury were upheld on direct appeal, are thus conclusively
established and adjudicated, and there is no need to re-prove them here. Obviously there was
‘no attempt to refute them by Dr. Chung.

In its Amended Complaint, the Board charged Dr. Chung with a single count of
violating NRS 630,301(1), Conviction of a Felony Relating to the Practice of Medicine. As
stated above, from such conclusively established facts which withstood appeal to the Nevada
Supreme Court, the Board! allegations and charges in its Amended Complaint are established.

‘There were no witnesses necessary in this case. Accordingly, there is no findings as to
credibility. This case is established pursuant to the criminal convictions of Dr. Chung. This
case is tragic, The breach of trust and the resulting stain on the medical profession is difficult

to articulate. The fallout to the victims is unquantifiable. Dr. Chung, should he ever be
released from custody, should not be allowed to practice medicine.
Ww

Wherefore, it is hereby recommended to the Board that Dr. Chung’s summarily

suspended license be permanently revoked. A copy of the exhibits relied upon by this hearing
officer is attached hereto, and incorporated herein.
