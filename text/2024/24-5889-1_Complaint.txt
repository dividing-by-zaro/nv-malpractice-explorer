4. Between February 10, 2017, and March 21, 2017, Patient A presented to, or
communicated with, the physician assistant at least five (5) times, but experienced no
improvement in his symptoms. Despite Patient A’s persistent symptoms, the physician assistant
continued to prescribe antibiotics to him. During this time, the physician assistant also obtained a
negative chest x-ray of Patient A.

5. Patient A first presented to Respondent on April 24, 2017, with the same or similar
symptoms. Respondent's notes indicated a history of upper respiratory symptoms for three (3)
months. Respondent also administered a steroid to treat Patient A’s unspecified upper respiratory
infection, and ordered another chest x-ray which showed no changes.

6. During this visit, Respondent also noted, “follow up 10 days if not improved -

TGA (Reason: pulmo referral),” but there is no indication in Respondent's notes that he sought
consultation with a specialty provider for a pulmonary evaluation.

7. Patient A presented again to Respondent on May 4, 2017, with the same or similar|
symptoms. Respondent again prescribed a steroid to Patient A. Respondent also recommended
that Patient A return to the clinic for an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) referral if Patient A’s
medication was ineffective.

8. Patent A presented again to Respondent on May 31, 2017, with chills, upper}
respiratory illness symptoms, daily fevers, night sweats, and a twenty (20) pound weight loss since
February 2017. Respondent also noted abnormal vital signs, including an elevated pulse and
decreased blood pressure of Patient A. Respondent ordered an additional medical evaluation with
laboratory studies and a CT scan of the sinuses. However, there is no documentation of a formal
referral for ENT care nor a pulmonary evaluation.

9. Respondent saw Patient A again on June 7, 2017, with the same or similar chief|
complaints. Respondent reviewed the laboratory studies and CT scan, which was negative.
Patient A's laboratory studies were abnormal, including a significant elevation in sedimentation
and low red blood cells including decreased hemoglobin. Patient A also demonstrated abnormal
vital signs, including an elevated pulse and decreased blood pressure. On this date, Respondent

recommended additional labs for coccidiosis serology, administered an_ intramuscular
triamcinolone injection, and again prescribed a steroid.

diagnosis.
