having a reasonable basis to believe that Dianne Mazzu, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 8208). Respondent was

originally licensed by the Board on June 19, 1997.

2. Patient A? was a forty-five (45) year-old female at the time of the events at issue
3. Patient A underwent a baseline screening mammogram test on August 18, 2017.

masses, significant calcifications, or other abnormalities are seen,” as well as a reading of
“BIRADS CATEGORY: 2 - Benign.”

5. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not recommend an immediate
additional evaluation of Patient A.

6. The mammogram scans from August 18, 2017, did however demonstrate signs of
abnormalities on Patient A’s right breast, such as a moderately prominent and sizable radially
oriented dumbbell shaped mass, or lesion, with spiculated margins measuring approximately
30mm by 12mm, present in the approximate eight (8) o’clock middle third of the right breast.
This lesion presented upon the correctly stated background of scattered fibroglandular densities
and was also distinctly asymmetric to the contralateral side.

7. The size, density, distortion, and asymmetry of the lesion should have prompted
Respondent to recommend additional evaluation of Patient A’s right breast or categorize the
mammograph examination as BIRADS category: 0 - incomplete, which would have necessitated
further evaluation of Patient A’s right breast.

8. In February 2018, Patient A underwent a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound,
which showed a mass in her right breast. Another radiologist, at that time, noted a reading of |
BIRADS CATEGORY: 5 - highly suggestive for malignancy.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

9. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein,

10. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action agaist a licensee.

Il. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

12. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed

to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when

rendering medical services to Patient A, when she failed to acknowledge or note, in her radiology
diagnostic report dated August 22, 2017, any abnormalities in Patient A’s right breast.
Respondent further failed to code the mammogram examination as BIRADS CATEGORY: 0
