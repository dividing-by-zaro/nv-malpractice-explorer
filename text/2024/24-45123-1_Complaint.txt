COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Alexander J. Hinman, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Matthew Elliot Apel, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 16424). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on April 19, 2016, with a specialty in surgery.

2. Patient A? was a thirty-eight (38) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On September 7, 2016, Respondent evaluated Patient A for discharge following
gastric band removal and revision to a sleeve gastrectomy performed by another surgeon the day
before.


! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Chowdhury H. Ahsan, M.D., Ms. Pamela J.
Beal, and Irwin B. Simon, M.D., FACS.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4. On September 12, 2016, at Patient A’s second postoperative clinic presentation,
Patient A was experiencing dehydration and was seen by Respondent. Patient A was treated with
IV fluids, IV medications, and prescribed oral steroids.

5. On September 14, 2016, Patient A was scheduled for an upper endoscopy with
Respondent as she was not progressing as expected and continued to remain intolerant to adequate
oral fluid intake. No physical examination nor vital signs were documented.

6. On September 15, 2016, Respondent performed an upper endoscopy procedure and
diagnosed a partial obstruction at the proximal gastric sleeve. Respondent then took Patient A to
the operating room for surgery that same day and performed reduction and repair of a re-herniated
sleeve, evacuation of a localized abscess, omentopexy of the sleeve to prevent twisting, and an
upper endoscopy thereafter.

7. Respondent only prescribed one dose of preoperative prophylactic antibiotics.
Furthermore, despite the identification of a localized abscess in a revisional bariatric case with
complications, he did not prescribe postoperative antibiotics, place a surgical drain, nor properly
evaluate Patient A prior to discharge.

8. As revisional bariatric surgery is of elevated risk and this was Patient A’s second
revisional procedure only nine (9) days postoperatively; a higher level of care and evaluation was
necessary.

9. As noted above, Patient A was prescribed steroids preoperatively by Respondent
which could potentially impair healing and should have been taken into consideration in his plan
of care for Patient A.

10. The postoperative record does not reveal an actual examination by Respondent, but
rather a template inserted into the discharge summary that is inconsistent with a post-surgical
assessment that would be standard in such a patient.

11. | On information and belief, Respondent did not evaluate Patient A prior to
discharge. Further, Respondent did not order any postoperative laboratory tests which may have
suggested the beginning of abnormalities associated with perforation following his complex

revisional procedure.

12. Respondent did not prescribe post operative antibiotics, nor did he place a surgical
drain following the evacuation of the localized abscess.

13. Respondent did not perform upper gastrointestinal imaging preoperatively or
postoperatively despite assuming the management of a complication revisional bariatric surgical
case.

14. On September 18, 2016, Patient A was brought by ambulance to Centennial Hills
Hospital by ambulance and was experiencing extreme sepsis. She was hypotensive with
metabolic acidosis and emergency resuscitative measures were initiated.

15. An abdominal CT revealed findings consistent with peritonitis (inflammation of the
lining of the abdomen) with significant fluid and free air present. Patient A was emergently
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where she was treated and transferred to North Vista
Hospital on September 19, 2016.

16. On September 19, 2016, Patient A was taken to an operative room by another
surgeon and was she was found to have extensive peritonitis with one (1) liter of purulent material
in the abdomen which was washed out. Drains were placed and she was returned to the ICU;
however, Patient A was in severe sepsis with multisystem organ failure and required intensive
management from multiple medical specialists and mechanical ventilation.

17. Due to the medications necessary to save Patient A’s life, the circulation to her
hands and feet were compromised and she developed necrosis.

18. On October 11, 2016, Patient was discharged after a complex intensive course of
treatment and life supportive measures. Patient A subsequently had to undergo several additional
treatments, wound care, hospital admissions, and procedures on her necrotic extremities.
Definitive wound management and treatment included partial amputation and skin grafting of her
necrotic fingers, toes, and partial foot amputation.

20. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

21. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

22. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, when he only prescribed one dose of preoperative
prophylactic antibiotics, and despite the identification of a localized abscess in a revisional
bariatric case with complications, he did not prescribe postoperative antibiotics, place a surgical
drain, nor properly evaluate Patient A prior to discharge.

23. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IT
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

24. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

25. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

26. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to document a physical examination nor document any
vital signs when he saw Patient A on September 14, 2016, and Respondent’s other documentation
during his care for Patient A was extremely limited in actual content, and his rationale for
treatment was often absent in a situation of high complexity. As a result, Patient A’s medical
records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

27. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
