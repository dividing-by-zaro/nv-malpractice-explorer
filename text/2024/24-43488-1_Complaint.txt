OF THE STATE OF NEVADA


In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 24-43488-1

Against: FI LED

MUSTAFA ISMAIL AHMED, M.D.
OCT 16 2024

Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

MEDI EXAMINER;
By:

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Alexander J. Hinman, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Mustafa Ismail Ahmed, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 15815). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on April 13, 2015.

2. Patient A? was a sixty-seven (67) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On December 12, 2018, Patient A first visited Respondent with an interest in
pursuing surgical weight loss operations, and a full physical examination was performed.

4. Patient A returned to see Respondent on January 24, 2019, February 13, 2019,
March 11, 2019, April 1, 2019, May 2, 2019, and May 24, 2019, before the surgery would

ultimately be performed on June 3, 2019.

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Aury Nagy, M.D., and
Michael C. Edwards, M.D., FACS.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. At each visit, the exact same physical exam was documented in the progress notes
of Patient A’s medical records. Each physical exam stated Respondent performed a rectal exam
and a bimanual vaginal exam to palpate the cervix, uterus, and ovaries.

6. However, documented in Patient A’s surgical history was a hysterectomy, which
indicates that Respondent did not actually perform the documented examinations of the uterus, as
Patient A’s uterus was removed prior to any of these examinations.

7. On June 3, 2019, after six (6) consultations and examinations had been performed,
Patient A was admitted to the hospital and underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with
duodenojejunostomy. The operation was complicated slightly because of a miscommunication
between Respondent and a CRNA. Specifically, the orogastric tube was stapled into the staple
line during the sleeve gastrectomy portion of the operation. This was subsequently freed and
Patient A had the stomach re-stapled successfully.

8. Patient A was admitted overnight after the procedure and was next seen by
Respondent at approximately 8:00 a.m., on the morning of June 4, 2019.

9. At this time, Patient A was having abdominal pain and not feeling like she was
ready for discharge; therefore, Patient A was kept in the hospital for another day for pain control.

10. On June 4, 2019, Patient A’s clinical condition deteriorated throughout the morning
and early afternoon, although there are no nursing or physician notes documenting the specific
sequence of events. While it was not confirmed until later, Respondent had perforated Patient A’s
jejunum (the second part of the small intestine) during the operation on June 3, 2019.

11. At 3:25 p.m., Respondent ordered lab work for Patient A which returned a finding
of acute renal failure.

12. At 5:20 p.m., a CT scan of the abdomen with oral contrast was ordered by
Respondent, indicating that he was aware of Patient A’s critical care; however, no resuscitation
fluid was ordered. Further, more than six (6) hours had passed before the CT was resulted. The
CT report listed postoperative changes and a small amount of free air and free fluid in the
perihepatic, perisplenic, and dependent portions of the pelvis with a comment that a small

perforation could not be excluded.

13. Patient A continued to decline in the evening of June 4, 2019, and had multiple
blood pressure readings that suggested severe sepsis. Additional lab work was performed around
9:30 p.m., which returned even more data suggesting Patient A was experiencing severe sepsis.

14. Patient A was eventually transferred to the ICU, where hospitalist and critical care
consultations were obtained for resuscitation and sepsis management.

15. On June 4, 2019, at 11:27 p.m., a progress note was entered by Respondent which
indicated his plans to transfer Patient A to the ICU; however, there was no physical exam included
in the note and there was no indication that Respondent ever came to the hospital or saw and
examined Patient A again.

16. Furthermore, there is no evidence that Respondent ever examined Patient A
between the morning of June 4, 2019, and the morning of June 5, 2019, the time frame during
which Patient A decompensated from the perforation of her bowel, and despite the overwhelming
evidence that Patient A had a life-threatening surgical complication.

17. Once in the ICU, Patient A received crystalloid resuscitation, vasopressors, and
antibiotics, but she continued to decline throughout the night and was intubated and started on
mechanical ventilation. Patient A was also subsequently put on dialysis.

18. On the morning of June 5, 2019, Patient A was taken back to surgery, though there
are no progress notes clarifying Respondent’s medical decision making.

19. Respondent’s operative note on June 5, 2019, indicated the surgery was
immediately converted from laparoscopic to open when he encountered stomach bile. During the
surgery, Respondent discovered an enterotomy (hole in the intestine) in the jejunum which was
the source of the abdominal sepsis.

20. After the second surgery was completed, Patient A’s condition continued to
decline, and she experienced multiple organ failure. Patient A’s condition never improved.

21. On June 6, 2019, at 11:32 p.m., Patient A was pronounced dead.

22. The causes of Patient A’s death were listed as cardiopulmonary arrest, septic
shock, and bowel perforation.

rendering medical services to Patient A, when he failed to recommend emergency surgery for
Patient A on the evening of June 4, 2019, when confronted with evidence that she had a bowel
perforation. Further, Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily
used under similar circumstances when he failed to recommend immediate surgery when the CT
was resulted, as well as several blood pressure readings and lab work suggesting severe sepsis.

32. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT Ill
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

35. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions when he treated
Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete, when, among
other things, he documented in each of the six (6) purported physical exams, that he performed a
bimanual vaginal exam to palpate Patient A’s cervix, uterus, and ovaries, despite it being clear
from the medical record that Patient A had a hysterectomy prior to meeting with Respondent,
making a physical exam on her uterus impossible. Further, Respondent failed to make progress
notes clarifying his medical decision making during his care of Patient A and when he decided to
perform a second surgery on Patient A.

36. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
