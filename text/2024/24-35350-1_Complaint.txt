44. — According to the PMP Patient Report for Patient A, Respondent prescribed sixty
(60) hydrocodone-acetaminophen 5-325 mg for thirty (30) days for Patient A and this prescription
was written on September 27, 2019, and filled on September 27, 2019,

45. According to the PMP Patient Report for Patient A, Respondent prescribed ninety
(90) tramadol hel 50 mg for thirty (30) days for Patient A and this prescription was written on
October 23, 2019, and filled on October 23, 2019.

46. According to the PMP Patient Report for Patient A, Respondent prescribed ninety
(90) tramadol! hel 50 mg for thirty (30) days for Patient A and this prescription was written on
November 22, 2019 and filled on November 22, 2019.

47. According to the PMP Patient Report for Patient A, Respondent prescribed twenty-
one (21) tramadol hel 50 mg for seven (7) days for Patient A and this prescription was written on
December 20, 2019, and filled on December 20, 2019.

48. According to the PMP Patient Report for Patient A, Respondent prescribed sixty-
nine (69) tramadol hel 50 mg for twenty-three (23) days for Patient A and this prescription was
written on December 20, 2019, and filled on December 24, 2019.

49. The standard of care for prescribing controlled substances is to avoid the use of
benzodiazepines (such as clonazepam and alprazolam) with opioids (such as hydrocodone-
acetaminophen, oxycodone-acetaminophen, and tramadol).

50. There is an increased potential for respiratory depression with the use of opioids
and benzodiazepines at the same time.

51. Respondent asserts that she did not prescribe both benzodiazepines and opioids to
Patient A at the same time.?

3 Patient A’s Patient Report from the PMP does show that a prescription of alprazolam 1 mg tablet (60 pills,
2 per day) was provided to Patient A by Respondent on November 9, 2018, filled on November 12, 2018 This
appears to be an entry error at the pharmacy where this medication was filled because Patient A saw another provider:
with the same last name as Respondent's for psychiatric care during the time at issue in this Complaint. Patient A
‘saw the other provider on the day that the prescription for alprazolam was written and medical records provided to the
IC do not show a visit with Respondent on that day. Therefore, information regarding these prescriptions 1s not
included in the factual allegations contained in this Complaint.

52. However, Respondent did prescribe Patient A opioids during the dates noted above,
and Respondent knew, or should have known, that Patient A was being prescribed
benzodiazepines by another prescribing provider at that same time.

53. Respondent completed eight (8) queries of the PMP to obtain Patient A’s Patient
Report during the dates noted above.

54. PMP records do not show that Respondent conducted queries of Patient A in the
PMP prior to prescribing controlled substances to her, or every ninety (90) days after prescribing
controlled substances to her as required by Nevada law.

58. While those eight (8) queries were not done frequently enough according to the
requirements of Nevada law, those queries still should have provided Respondent with some
information about Patient A’s other medications, specifically the benzodiazepines that she was
receiving from other providers.

56. During the period from January 2018 through December 2019, Patient A’s Patient
Report in the PMP shows consistent, monthly prescriptions for both opioid and benzodiazepine
medications.

57. During the period from January 2018 through December 2019, Respondent failed
to meet the standard of care when she prescribed opioid medications to Patient A.

58. Respondent failed to maintain clear, accurate, legible, and complete medical
records for Patient A during the period from January 2019 through December 2019.

59. Specifically, Respondent failed to ensure that Patient A’s medication list was
accurate and complete. For example, at each visit with Patient A, Respondent does not include
Patient A’s prescription for alprazolam or clonazepam that was provided by another prescribing
practitioner in Patient A’s medication list.

60. Inher review of Patient A’s PMP Patient Report, Respondent should have noticed
that Patient A was receiving a benzodiazepine that was not on her medication list.

61. Respondent should have asked Patient A about these other medications and/or
updated Patient A’s medication list to include these other medications, particularly given the

serious concern regarding concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids.

62. Patient A’s records do not reflect that this was discussed with Patient A or that

Patient A’s medication list was updated to accurately reflect the medications that she was being

prescribed.
63. Patient A’s current medication list contained in her medical records included both
gabapentin 300 mg and Lyrica 200 mg for the time period addressed in this Complaint.

64. When asked whether Patient A was taking both of these medications at the same
time, Respondent indicated that Patient A did not tolerate Lyrica and she instead prescribed
Patient A gabapentin. However, both medications remained on Patient A’s current medication list
in her medical records for the time period at issue.

65. Patient A’s current medication list contained in her medical records included both
Norco 5-325 mg and Norco 7.5-325 mg for the time period addressed in this Complaint.

66. When asked whether Patient A was taking both of these doses of Norco at the same
time, Respondent indicated that Patient A was weaned from the higher Norco dose to the lower
Norco dose. However, both medications remained on Patient A’s current medication list in her
medical records for the time period at issue.

67. Tramadol was also listed as a current medication for Patient A in her medical
records for the time period at issue. Yet, in her response to the Board regarding this investigation,
Respondent indicated that Patient A was weaned from the higher Norco dose, to the lower Norco
dose, to a dose of Tramadol 50 mg TID pm as of March 2020. Patient A’s medical records do not
make this clear because all three (3) medications are listed as current medications during the time
period at issue.

68. In addition, in 2019, Patient A’s Patient Report from the PMP showed both Norco
5-325 mg and Tramadol Hel 50 mg being prescribed to Patient A at the same time.

69. Prior to receiving Tramadol Hel mg from Respondent in March 2019, Patient A
was taking two (2) Norco 5-325 mg tablets per day.

70. Yet, in March 2019 and May 2019, Patient A’s Patient Report showed that
Patient A was continuing to take two (2) Norco 5-325s each day even though three (3) Tramadol
Hel 50 mg tablets were added each day. In other words, her dose of Norco 5-325 did not decrease
when the Tramadol Hel 50 mg tablets were added.

71. Patient A’s current medications list should have been updated by Respondent at
each visit.

72 It is not clear in Patient A’s plan of care in her medical records what her current
treatment medications should be.

NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A.

71. Specifically, Respondent prescribed opioids to Patient A while Patient A was also
receiving benzodiazepines from another provider at the same time and Respondent knew or should
have known about Patient A’s benzodiazepines prescriptions.

78. Patient A’s medical records do not reflect that Respondent talked to Patient A
about this issue and/or considered it in her plan of care for Patient A.

79. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

82. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document her actions and/or ensure that

treated Patient A, causing Patient A’s medical records not to be timely, legible, accurate, and
complete.
