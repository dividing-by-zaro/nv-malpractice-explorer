Against: FI LE D
FRANK JOSEPH DE LEE, M.D., AUG 15 2024
Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
MEDJ€AL EXAMINERS
By: t——~___—
COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Sarah A. Bradley, Deputy Executive Director and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Frank Joseph De Lee, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 4126). Respondent was

originally licensed by the Board on October 4, 1980.

Treatment of Patient A
2s Patient A? was a forty-two (42) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.
35 On or about October 2016, Patient A began seeing Respondent for gynecological

care, specifically her “heavy periods.”


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Aury Nagy, M.D., and
Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.)

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4, On March 23, 2018, Patient A was seen at the Henderson Hospital Emergency
Department and treated for pelvic inflammatory disease.

5. On March 23, 2018, Patient A’s white blood count was 15.17 x 103.

6. Upon information and belief, this white blood count is consistent with moderate
pelvic inflammatory disease heading toward severe pelvic inflammatory disease.

7. Patient A had a vaginal culture while at the hospital which revealed Gardnerella.

8. Patient A did not receive culture or testing for gonorrhea or chlamydia.

9. Patient A was discharged from the hospital and given doxycycline 100 mg to take
daily by mouth.

10. Patient A was told to follow up with Respondent who is her regular gynecologist.

Il. On March 26, 2018, Patient A was seen at Respondent’s office for an evaluation of
her pelvic pain and heavy menses.

12. At this visit Respondent did not document that he completed a thorough history and
physical in Patient A’s medical records in that visit.

13. Respondent only noted that Patient A was experiencing pelvic pain and heavy
periods and that he recommended a total abdominal hysterectomy without developing a
differential diagnosis.

14. Respondent did not document any possibility that Patient A had pelvic
inflammatory diseases, a pelvic infection, or a pelvic abscess.

15. Respondent further did not document the quality of Patient A’s pelvic pain, such as
whether it was acute, chronic, stabbing, or radiating.

16. Respondent did not note in Patient A’s medical records the timing of her pelvic
pain or the provocative/palliative and precipitating/relieving causes of her pelvic pain.

17. Respondent also did not address the etiology of Patient A’s pelvic pain in her
medical records.

18. Respondent only noted in Patient A’s medical records that her pelvic pain was
severe and did not document a pain scale.

19. Respondent reviewed a pelvic ultrasound for Patient A which revealed bilateral
simple ovarian cysts, with no uterine masses or fibroids.

20. Based on Patient A’s pelvic pain and heavy menses, Respondent recommended that
she undergo a total abdominal hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

21. Part of the standard of care when providing care to a patient is to discuss the risks,
benefits, alternatives, and possible outcomes of a recommended treatment and/or procedure. This
discussion should be documented in the patient’s medical records.

22. There is no documentation in Patient A’s medical records that Respondent had a
discussion with Patient A of the risks and benefits of keeping her ovaries versus having them
removed prior to her surgery on May 7, 2018.

23. Accordingly, Respondent’s documentation of Patient A’s medical condition,
possible diagnoses, and possible treatment in her medical records is lacking and inadequate.

24. Upon information and belief, Respondent should have treated Patient A for a
progressive pelvic infectious process and pelvic inflammatory disease at this time.

25. Upon information and belief, Respondent should have considered providing Patient
A with IV parenteral antibiotic therapy at this time.

26. On May 7, 2018, Respondent operated on Patient A and performed a total
abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, supracervical I hysterectomy.

27. Patient A’s pre-operative white blood count was 19.11 x 10°, which is a high level
of white blood cells.

28. Respondent did not address Patient A’s high white blood count prior to her elective
surgery procedure in Patient A’s medical records.

29. Accordingly, there is no evidence that Respondent discussed Patient A’s high white
blood count with her prior to her surgery or that Patient A was even aware of her high white blood
count prior to her surgery.

30. Given Patient A’s history of treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease in March
2018 and Patient A’s high white blood count, Respondent should have suspected that Patient A

still had a pelvic infection on May 7, 2018, and treated that infection prior to her surgery.

31. Upon information and belief, Respondent should have cancelled Patient A’s
surgery on May 7, 2018, after seeing her high white blood count (19.11 x 103) and admitted
Patient A into the hospital and initiated IV parenteral antibiotics.

32. In addition to Patient A’s high white blood count, her platelets were elevated on
May 7, 2018 (729 x 10°).

33. There are many reasons that a patient may have elevated platelets, but the most
common reason is infection.

34. Upon information and belief, Patient A’s elevated platelets were an additional sign
that she was suffering from an infection and Respondent should have postponed her elective
surgery until after her infection was adequately treated with parenteral IV antibiotics.

35. Upon information and belief, Patient A had a pelvic infection on May 7, 2018, that
was present prior to and after her surgery.

36. Upon information and belief, this infection developed into severe sepsis and
abscess formation.

37. Accordingly, given Patient A’s white blood count and elevated platelets,
Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used by physicians
under similar circumstances when he proceeded with Patient A’s elective surgery on May 7, 2018.

38. Patient A received prophylaxis clindamycin by IV as documented in the
anesthesiologist’s note in her medical records.

39. Respondent checked a box in Patient A’s medical records indicating that he had
reviewed her history and physical and had examined her. Respondent further indicated that there
was no change to her history and physical.

40. A post-operative note for Patient A showed that her urine output was clear and
25-30 cc, which is a low urine output.

41. On May 8, 2018, Patient A’s white blood count was 23.7 x 107, hemoglobin
7.7 gm/dl. This is a high white blood count, and it had increased from the previous day,
May 7, 2018.

42. Patient A’s hemoglobin of 7.7 on May 8, 2018, indicated that she had severe
anemia.

43. On May 10, 2018, Patient A was discharged from the hospital and received
Percocet and Premarin.

44, Patient A did not receive antibiotics with her discharge.

45. Given Patient A’s high white blood count, Patient A should have received post-
operative antibiotics with her discharge.

46. Given Patient A’s anemia, Patient A should have also received treatment for her
anemia post-operatively.

47. On May 14, 2018, Patient A saw Respondent for a post-operative follow-up visit,
with complaints of incisional pressure.

48. Respondent noted in Patient A’s medical record for this visit “doing good, incision
is healing. RTO in 2 weeks.”

49. On May 29, 2018, Patient A saw Respondent for a follow-up visit, with complaints
of abdominal pain, constipation, and pelvic pain. Respondent recommended for her to return for a
follow up in one week.

50. On June 5, 2018, Patient A, as recommended, saw Respondent for a follow-up
visit, with complaints of painful numbness in her leg and a left-sided abdominal lump. At this
visit Respondent ordered a pelvic ultrasound for Patient A.

51. On June 6, 2018, Patient A had a pelvic ultrasound. The pelvic ultrasound revealed
a 6.1 x 4.8 cm hypoechoic collection in the left lower quadrant anterior wall, which may represent
a hematoma or seroma.

52. On June 7, 2018, Patient A was taken to the Henderson Hospital Emergency
Department.

53. On June 7, 2018, Patient A’s white blood count was 24.95 x 103 and she was
suspected to be suffering from sepsis and possible strangulation of a ventral hernia.

54, ACT scan of Patient A’s abdomen further revealed an abdominal wall abscess and

an intraabdominal abscess and Patient A was taken to the operating room (OR) for surgery.

55. The OR physicians, Dr. D and Dr. C, described finding an abscess in Patient A’s
abdominal wall, which was an intra-abdominal process through a defect in the fascia; copious
clear fluid mixing with purulent material was found in the abscess.

56. | Dr. D and Dr. C also found a 4 cm laceration on the dome of Patient A’s bladder.

57. Patient A’s bladder was sewn to her rectus muscle and the rectosigmoid
posteriorly.

58. Upon information and belief, Respondent injured Patient A’s bladder during her
surgery on May 7, 2018.

59. Generally, when performing a hysterectomy, a physician will create a bladder flap
or develop an incision above the bladder to advance the bladder. This involves dissecting the
vesicouterine peritoneum with scissors and advancing, in order to develop a bladder flap and
protect the bladder from injury. The bladder is then advanced either by sharp dissection or by
gently pushing the bladder inferiorly by applying pressure with a sponge stick pressing on the
cervix. This operative step, and the manner it is completed by the physician, should be
documented in the operative notes for the patient.

60. In Patient A’s medical records for her surgery on May 7, 2018, Respondent did not
describe this operative step.

61. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used by
physicians under similar circumstances when he sutured Patient A’s bladder to her rectus muscle
and sutured Patient A’s bladder to her rectum and sigmoid colon as found by Dr. D and C on
June 7, 2018.

62. Upon information and belief, suturing Patient A’s bladder to her rectus muscle and
suturing Patient A’s bladder to her rectum and sigmoid colon is evidence that Respondent
provided substandard care to Patient A.

63. Throughout his care of Patient A, it is not clear what Respondent’s possible
diagnoses and/or differential diagnoses are for Patient A based on her symptoms and blood work,
as Respondent failed to document any notes, diagnosis, or assessments related to Patient A’s

symptoms, ongoing complaints and test results.

64. On June 7, 2018, Patient A, while at the hospital, received three antibiotics by IV in
order to combat her infection.

65. On June 21, 2018, Patient A was discharged after spending fourteen (14) days at
Henderson Hospital.

Treatment of Patient B

66. Patient B? was an eighteen (18) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

67. On November 18, 2019, Patient B was transported to North Vista Hospital by
ambulance and was admitted to the Emergency Department and triaged.

68. Patient B was thirty-three (33) weeks pregnant at this time, with an estimated due
date of January 6, 2020.

69. Patient B complained of abdominal pain both in the ambulance and to North Vista
Emergency Department staff.

70. Patient B’s temperature was normal, but her pulse was elevated.

71. North Vista Hospital Emergency Department staff recorded Patient B’s
temperature as normal and her pulse being at 117 beats per minute (BPM), and then elevating to
138 BPM. Patient B also began to have abdominal cramping.

72. North Vista Hospital Emergency Department staff were concerned that Patient B
was in pre-term labor and discussed transporting Patient B to University Medical Center, where
her obstetrician, Dr. M., works, so that Patient B and her fetus may receive a higher level of care.

73. On November 18, 2019, at approximately 9:08 p.m., Patient B experienced a
spontaneous rupture of membranes with bloody fluid.

74, A North Vista Hospital Emergency Department nurse placed her hand in Patient
B’s vagina to prevent vaginal delivery and to attempt to prevent prolapse of the cord.

75. At this time, Patient B’s pulse was 138 BPM and she was experiencing
contractions every three (3) minutes.

76. At approximately 10:22 p.m. on November 18, 2019, Respondent was called by the

North Vista Hospital Emergency Department to come to the hospital to provide care for Patient B.

3 Patient B’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

77. Patient B was now experiencing pre-term labor with premature rupture of
membranes with bloody fluid, tachycardia, with a footling breech.

78. At approximately 11:00 p.m. on November 18, 2019, Patient B is transported by
gurney into the operating room at North Vista Hospital for an emergency C-section.

79. At approximately 11:21 p.m. on November 18, 2019, Patient B is evaluated by Dr.
C, an anesthesiologist.

80. At approximately 11:24 p.m. on November 18, 2019, Respondent arrived and
evaluated Patient B.

81. This is one hour and two minutes after he was called to provide care for Patient B.

82. The following was noted in Patient B’s medical records: “@2320 Patient into OR
for emergency c-section, respiratory team in room. Baby out at 2330. Surgery done. Foley
inserted at 2344. Abdominal x-ray s/p surgery per Dr. DeLee. Transport for baby and mother
called for by ER charge nurse. Patient appears pale, tachycardic, hypotensive. Uterus firm-
bleeding noted-2 pads saturated with blood. Anesthesia—Surgeon continue to massage uterus.
PACU nurses in room to recover patient. Pt. clean and put in diaper. Pt. stable and awaiting
transport.”

83. Patient B was then transported to Sunrise Hospital and would eventually be
evaluated by Dr. G.

84. Patient B’s hemoglobin at this time was 5.1 gm/dl, and was in need of a blood
transfusion.

85. While waiting for a blood transfusion, Patient B became unresponsive and code
blue was activated. While Patient B did not lose her pulse, the code was activated because of her
critical care need.

86. At this time, Patient B had marked lethargy but was arousable.

87. Respondent was notified and aware of Patient B’s transfer.

88. Respondent determined that Patient B did not need to return to the operating room
at this time.

a

89. Upon evaluation, Dr. G. indicated that Patient B had hemorrhagic shock, acute
bleeding, possible disseminated intravascular coagulopathy or HELLP syndrome (hemolysis,
elevated liver proteins, and low platelets).

90. Dr. G. initiated massive transfusion protocol with aggressive resuscitation and
described her prognosis as “overall very guarded.”

91. Dr. G. indicated a need to consult with hematology, obstetrics, nephrology, and
neurology for Patient B’s care.

92. On November 19, 2019, at approximately 10:00 a.m., Patient B received a
computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of her abdomen and pelvis with contrast.

93. This CTA revealed a large hemoperitoneum with acute contrast extravasation
which originates in the right parametrial region.

94. On November 19, 2019, at approximately 10:20 am., Patient B received a
computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of her chest with contrast.

95. This CTA showed no evidence of pulmonary emboli. It showed bilateral extensive
consolidations, more prominent in the dependent aspect. These findings may be due to severe
pulmonary edema, aspirations, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

96. On November 19, 2019, at approximately 10:33 am., Patient B received a
computed tomography (CT) of her brain without contrast.

97. | The CT showed that she had a left cerebral acute or chronic subdural hematoma.

98. On November 19, 2019, at approximately 11:49 am., Dr. S. signed a note
indicating that Patient B had thrombocytopenia likely due to disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC) and severe sepsis and consumption. Dr. S. also noted “macrocytic anemia,
DIC, leukocytosis, septic/hemorrhagic shock vasopressors per cc.”

99. At Sunrise Hospital on November 19, 2019, Respondent authored a note
documenting the transfer of Patient B from North Vista Hospital. Respondent stated, “Blood loss
less than normal for cesarean section and the patient seemed to tolerate it well. I received a phone
call from Anesthesia (North Vista Hospital) that the patient was slightly tachycardic and after

discussing the case with him, it was his decision that the patient was stable for transport. She was

transported to Sunrise Post Anesthesia Care Unit on Labor and Deliver at which time she was
talking with the nurse and appeared stable. She was pale and slightly tachycardic with a blood
pressure at 80/40’s. Blood was ordered and her H and H was 5.5 and 16. I received a phone call
from Dr. D. telling me of the plan. I received a second phone call that the patient was stable and
somewhat lethargic, and they were waiting for the blood to be transfused. Approximately 2 hours
later, I received another phone call that the patient had a cardiac arrest and was being transported
to the ICU. At this time the intensivist were taking care of the patient. I received another phone
call from the intensivist that that patient was having some vaginal bleeding. After talking with the
doctor, it was not deemed an emergency since she has a cesarian section and birth of a baby. I
atrived at the hospital and this time her belly was soft. The bleeding was not significant for a
postpartum patient and at this time she had another cardiac arrest. There were multiple doctors
taking care of the patient at this time and J observed for a while, talked to the family and left. 3
hours later I was told that a CT scan showed a massive amount of blood in the belly as well as a
subdural hematoma. I made a call to Dr. F. and to see if he would consult on this patient and meet
me in the operating room to try to take care of this problem. Unfortunately, while in the operating
room, the patient coded multiple times, and finally time of death was stated as approximately
12:50, I believe.”

100. Dr. F. dictated an Operative Report at 1:05 p.m. on November 19, 2019, stating
“When we opened the abdomen, we emptied out 5,000 ml of blood and clots, we lifted up the
uterus and could see bleeding coming from the area of the right uterine artery. At this point the
patient was completely unstable and we decided to . . . see if we could control the bleeding on the
right side, which appeared to be the bleeding.”

101. Dr. F. and Respondent performed a subtotal hysterectomy on Patient B.

102. During the procedure, Patient B was pronounced dead.

103. Patient B’s autopsy showed the following: “The history of laboratory work
demonstrates progressive decrease in platelets, starting from normal, and coagulation studies
demonstrate an initially somewhat elevated D-Dimer and normal other studies, with subsequent

coagulation studies showing increasing abnormalities. Peripheral blood smears at different times

22.

demonstrate decrease in platelets with time, but do not show microangiopathic changes in these
laboratory results and peripheral smear results can be explained by significant hemorthage, and a
high number of transfused blood products which do not completely replace the blood loss.”

104, Patient B’s autopsy, internal examination, showed the following: “The cervix,
paracervical/endocervical tissues demonstrate a significant degree of hemorrhage within the tissue
itself. It is not possible to reconstruct vessels in this area as both the hysterectomy specimen and
the pelvis as visualized contain surgical instrumentation, and no spare medium to large vascular
structures.”

105. Upon information and belief, most hospital bylaws require that an obstetrician be
present within thirty (30) minutes to labor and delivery when called regarding an emergency
situation.

106. Respondent’s presentation to labor and delivery after one hour and two minutes
does not meet this requirement.

107. Upon information and belief, Respondent injured Patient B’s right uterine vessels
at the time of her cesarean section.

108. This is evidenced by Dr. F. noting that 5,000 ml of blood and clots were found in
Patient B’s abdomen and his observation that there was bleeding coming from Patient B’s right
uterine artery.

109. Patient B’s medical records do not document that another obstetrician/gynecologist
assisted during Patient B’s cesarean section.

110. Patient B’s medical records do note that Patient B was in the operating room at
2320 for cesarean section and that the baby was out at 2330. This is just ten (10) minutes for the
baby to be delivered.

111. The North Vista Hospital records do not contain an operative report dictated by
Respondent regarding Patient B’s delivery by cesarean section.

112. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not prepare an operative report
regarding Patient B’s delivery by cesarean section.

113. Respondent’s note on November 19, 2019, at Sunrise Hospital summarizing Patient
B’s care from the time of her transfer from North Vista to Sunrise states “Mother was stable from
cesarian section and seemed to tolerate it well.”

114. However, a North Vista Hospital nurse indicated in Patient B’s medical records
post cesarean that Patient B “appears pale, tachycardic and hypotensive. Uterus firm. Bleeding
saturated with blood. Anesthesiologist and Surgeon aware. Continued to massage the uterus.”

115. The nurse’s description post Patient B’s cesarean does not match Respondent’s.

116. Respondent does not note in Patient B’s medical records that he considered
drawing labs post-operatively at North Vista Hospital or performing an ultrasound post-
operatively on Patient B at her bedside at North Vista Hospital in order to determine if she is
experiencing intra-abdominal bleeding.

117. Respondent does not document that he considered administering misoprostol 600
mcg sublingually or 15-methylprostaglandin F-2 alpha intramuscularly) due to a post-partum
hemorrhage.

118. Upon information and belief, the lack of documentation described in § 116-117 is
evidence at best that Respondent failed to maintain adequate and complete medical records for
Patient B and at worst that Respondent provided substandard care to Patient B.

119. Respondent did not obtain post-operative laboratory testing for Patient B such as
PT, PTT, INR, disseminated coagulation panel, or a urine toxicity panel.

120. Respondent did not attempt to perform uterine packing or balloon tamponade with
a balloon device or a transvaginal pelvic packing device.

121. When Patient B was transferred to Sunrise Hospital, Respondent did not intervene
with surgery or provide for a ready operative team to treat Patient B.

122. Respondent failed to recognize that surgical options may have helped Patient B,
including evaluation of Patient B’s uterus for abnormal bleeding, B-Lynch procedure, uterine
artery ligation, or hysterectomy.

123. Post-cesarean at North Vista Hospital, according to her medical records noted by
Dr. C, Patient B’s systolic blood pressure was 80, her diastolic blood pressure was 40, and her
heart rate was 138.

124, A systolic blood pressure less than 80 is abnormal, diastolic blood pressure less
than 50 is abnormal, and heart rate greater than 120 is abnormal.

125. Two of those three were abnormal for Patient B, meaning that she was not stable to
transport.

126. Upon information and belief, Respondent should not have transferred Patient B to
Sunrise Hospital, and, instead, should have evaluated her at North Vista Hospital, ultimately
taking her back into the operating room to evaluate hemorrhage.

127. Respondent should have ordered all of the laboratory testing and imaging studies
ordered by Dr. G. at Sunrise Hospital prior to her transfer.

128. Respondent should have performed an exploratory laparotomy to evaluate Patient
B’s blood loss and Respondent should have created a differential diagnosis for Patient B.

129. Assuming, arguendo, the transfer to Sunrise Hospital was appropriate in order to
provide Patient B with a higher level of care, Respondent should have followed the ambulance to
Sunrise Hospital, been present, and discussed the case with Dr. G. and taken Patient B to the
operating room at Sunrise Hospital rather than allowing Patient B to be transferred to the ICU and
giving up authority to Emergency Department and ICU personnel at Sunrise Hospital.

130. The Emergency Department and ICU personnel could not take Patient B to the
operating room for an exploratory laparotomy.

131. Respondent did not do anything with regard to Patient B’s care until
November 19, 2019, at 10:20 a.m. after receiving the results of her CTA of her abdomen and
pelvis.

132. Then, Respondent considers exploring the source of the hemorrhage and calls Dr.
F. to assist him.

133. By this time, too much time had already passed and Patient B had already lost too

much blood.

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


134. Upon information and belief, Respondent failed to timely diagnose Patient B’s life-
threatening hemorrhage.

135. Upon information and belief, Patient B’s tachycardia and hypotension
post-cesarean were symptoms of her hemorrhage.

136. Upon information and belief, Respondent should have suspected Patient B was
experiencing a hemorrhage post-cesarean and quickly provided her treatment for this condition.

Treatment of Patient C

137. Patient C* was a twenty-three (23) year-old female at the time of the events at
issue.

138. On October 14, 2016, Respondent delivered Patient C’s baby by cesarean section,

139. Prior to the cesarean section, Patient C had undergone a long induction with
Cervidil, followed by Pitocin.

140. Prior to the cesarean section, Patient C had elevated tachycardia, and her baby was
tachycardic.

141. Patient C’s diagnosis was failure to progress, fetal intolerance to labor with
cephalopelvic disproportion.

142. Patient C had a prolonged rupture of membranes, meconium staining, an internal
fetal scalp electrode, intrauterine pressure catheter, untreated Gardnerella Vaginalis infection,
chorioamnionitis, and cesarean section.

143. Ather discharge from the hospital, post-cesarean, Patient C’s pulse was 108 BPM.

144. Patient C’s post-cesarean placental pathology revealed acute early
chorioamnionitis.

145. Patient C saw Respondent for two (2) post-operative visits.

146. Respondent noted at Patient C’s first post-operative visit, on October 20, 2016, she
had complaints of cesarean section wound discomfort, pus from the incision, sweats, and fatigue.

147. Respondent did not treat Patient C with antibiotics nor did he take an incisional or

vaginal culture.

4 Patient C’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

148. Respondent’s handwriting in Patient C’s medical records for this visit are difficult
to decipher. Respondent noted in Patient C’s medical records for this visit “without infection,
swelling” and that her blood pressure was 128/80.

149. Respondent did not take and/or document Patient C’s temperature in her medical
records, despite Patient C’s complaints of sweating.

150. Respondent did not take and/or document Patient C’s pulse.

151. Respondent did not adequately document an abdominal examination of Patient C at
this visit.

152. Respondent did not perform and/or did not document a speculum examination for
cervical or uterine tenderness or foul-smelling lochia.

153. Respondent did not perform and/or did not document a wet prep or examination of
Patient C for infection.

154. On October 24, 2016, Patient C was seen by Respondent, in which he noted in her
medical records that her abdomen was tense/painful and she complained of feeling weak and
stated she may have “overdone it” over the weekend.

155. At that visit, Respondent ordered a pelvic ultrasound for Patient C and a complete
blood count test, and referred her to the Spring Valley Hospital Emergency Department.

156. Patient C’s medical records for her visit on October 24, 2016 show inadequate
documentation for her vital signs and physical examination. They further show no assessment or
plan for treatment other than that Respondent was sending her to the Spring Valley Hospital
Emergency Department.

157. After presenting at the Spring Valley Hospital Emergency Department, Patient C
was transferred to the ICU where she was treated by Dr. S., who requested numerous
consultations with colleagues from surgery, infectious disease, and nephrology.

158. Patient C was diagnosed with septic shock, necrotizing fasciitis of her cesarian
section incisional wound, extended spectrum beta-lactamase E. Coli, acute renal failure, and
altered mental status.

159. On that day, October 24, 2016, Patient C was taken to the Operating Room at
Spring Vailey Hospital where she underwent an exploratory laparotomy by Dr. M. with extensive
debridement of her abdominal wall. During the laparotomy Dr. M found purulent drainage.

160. Patient C’s family was informed of her likely need for further treatment, including
further debridement and hysterectomy.

161. The next day, October 25, 2016, Patient C underwent a second exploratory
laparotomy for indications of necrotizing fasciitis and purulent pelvic peritonitis. Patient C then
received a subtotal hysterectomy performed by Dr. F. and Dr. D.

162. Patient C was anemic and received two units of packed red blood cells PRBC).

163. Patient C’s pathology revealed that she had acute and chronic endometritis and
acute and chronic serositis.

164. Patient C had a PIIC line placed as well as a CVP line, and she received multiple
regimens of antibiotics.

165. Patient C was placed on a ventilator and received pressor support and blood
transfusions.

166. Patient C experienced acute multi-organ failure.

167. In a Cochrane Review, the mean incidence of endometritis following low
transverse cesarean section for non-elective or emergency cesarean section was 30%.

168. Risk factors for endometritis following cesarean section include long inductions,
amniotomy with longer duration of rapture of membranes, multiple pelvic exams prior to incision,
meconium staining, bacterial vaginosis (Gardnerella vaginitis), urgency of operation, younger
patients, non-white patients, unmarried patients, Medicaid or no health insurance patients,
chorioamnionitis, induced labor, amnioinfusion, and artificial rupture of membranes.

169. Patient C experienced the majority of these risk factors. Therefore, according to
the Cochrane Review, Patient C would have then had a 30% chance of endometritis.

170. On November 7, 2016, after her critical care admission, treatment for septic shock,
two surgeries including debridement of necrotizing fasciitis, subtotal hysterectomy, vent

dependent respiratory failure, acute multi-organ failure gradually improving, acute renal

insufficiency improving, lactic acidosis improving, mild transaminitis, severe protein caloric
malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia, and acute anemia resolution, treatment with heparin
subcutaneous for DVT prophylaxis, Patient C was transferred from Spring Valley Hospital to
Mountain View Hospital Rehabilitation.

On November 14, 2016, Patient C had a CT of her abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast,
with findings of multiple fluid collections that were identified within her right lower quadrant
abdomen and pelvis, which may have indicated possible abscesses.

171. On November 17, 2016, Patient C was transferred to Desert Springs Hospital.

172. Then, on November 18, 2016, Patient C was re-admitted to Spring Valley Hospital
when she developed a low-grade fever and the CT on November 14, 2016, revealed possible
abscesses.

173. On November 20, 2016, Patient C was discharged after receiving antibiotics and
drain placements, with tissue plasminogen activators placed in both catheters,

174. Patient C’s diagnosis was infected hematomas and pneumonia, showing
retrocardiac airspace disease consistent with atelectasis.

175. Patient C again received a PIIC line, UTI-treatment, DVT prophylaxis, and
consultations with infectious disease, interventional radiology, and wound care.

176. Upon information and belief, Patient C’s injuries and infections that resulted in her
hospitalization on October 24, 2016, were caused by the cesarean section performed by
Respondent on October 14, 2016.

177. Respondent failed to recognize Patient C’s injuries and infections at her first post-
operative appointment on October 20, 2016, when she complained of wound discomfort with pus,
sweats, and fatigue.

178. Accordingly, Respondent failed to initiate antibiotic treatment in a timely manner,
which allowed Patient C’s infections to worsen and exacerbate her medical condition, requiring
more extensive treatment and hospitalization.
