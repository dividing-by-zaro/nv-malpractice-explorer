5. Respondent prescribed Tylenol #3 (Acetaminophen and Codeine), a controlled
substance, at nearly every visit with Patient A without ever referencing any medical basis or
reasoning for why it was being prescribed.

6. On August 9, 2019, Respondent noted Patient A had “mild suprapubic discomfort”
for the first time. Respondent further noted, as Respondent throughout his care of Patient, that her
abdominal exam was normal, and he prescribed Tylenol #3. Respondent did not order a pelvic
exam, or a urinalysis (UA) and no pelvic exam was ever documented.

i All subsequent notes after the August 9, 2019, visit with Respondent documented
Patient A as having “mild suprapubic discomfort,” with a normal physical exam. No orders were
ever given addressing Patient A’s complaint of discomfort in her pelvic area.

8. On February 10, 2020, Patient A again complained of pelvic pain, but no pelvic
exam was performed, and the physical exam was documented as normal. During this visit, and for
the first time in the six (6) months since Patient A began reporting suprapubic pain, Respondent
ordered labs for a metabolic panel, complete blood count (CBC), liver function test (LFT), lipid
panel, UA, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), as well as a mammogram However,
Respondent failed to order diagnostic imaging of any kind.

9. On November 13, 2020, Respondent prescribed Patient A prednisone and multiple
medications for asthma exacerbation despite there being no documented complaints of respiratory
issues from Patient A, nor were there any underlying medical diagnoses or medical reasoning
noted during the visit.

10. On February 8, 2021, in the “history of present illness” section of the form for
Patient A, Respondent documented “abdominal pain perumbilical”, but he also noted that
Patient A’s abdominal exam was normal. Respondent, for the first time since seeing Patient A in
April of 2019, ordered abdominal ultrasounds. Respondent again prescribed Patient A Tylenol #3
without any documented medical rationale. The ultrasound was not completed until March 18,
2021, and was the imaging was not read until March 23, 2021.

11. On March 8, 2021, Patient A was seen by Respondent and in the Review of

Systems (ROS) portion of the medical notes, Respondent wrote Patient A “denies abdominal pain,

13,

mild suprapubic discomfort,” but Respondent yet again failed to order a pelvic exam.
Additionally, there was no discussion of whether the ultrasound had been performed.

12, On April 5, 2021, Patient A “came for follow up to review US (ultrasound),” which
showed she had a large, five (5) pound, ovarian tumor. Patient A allegedly claimed that she had
no pain in that area, but stated she felt abdominal bloating. In the ROS, Respondent noted, again,
“[Patient A] reports mild suprapubic discomfort,” and a normal physical exam was noted.
Respondent then ordered a CT scan and an OB/GYN follow up. The CT was ordered routine,
rather than STAT, and the results of the CT, received April 12, 2021, revealed a “large complex
pelvic mass suspicious for malignancy.”

13. On May 3, 2021, Respondent noted that Patient A is “[fJeeling well” and he stated,
“CT to review and that [Patient A] has a follow up with OG/GYN oncologist.” The ROS noted
“mild suprapubic discomfort.”

14. On July 20, 2021, Patient A underwent extensive surgery for the removal of the
large ovarian tumor, which turned out to be benign. As with all of Respondent's notes for
Patient A, “mild suprapubic discomfort,” was reported. No physical examination was documented.

15. On August 20, 2021, the Respondent's medical notes for Patient A stated, “patient
claimed her incision is closed but she is still [experiencing] abdominal discomfort.” Patient A was
sent back to work beginning September 2021, and an abdominal exam was noted to be “within
normal limits.”

16. Ona September 3, 2021, visit, Respondent noted Patient A was “[s]till complaining
of pain and discomfort,” and Patient A requested that her leave from work be extended, and an
abdominal exam was noted to be normal. ROS “reports mild suprapubic discomfort,” and a
normal abdominal exam was documented.

18. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

19. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

20. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, when he: 1) failed to properly evaluate Patient A’s
complaints of suprapubic pain by failing to perform a pelvic exam and document or perform a
thorough and accurate physical exam, despite eighteen (18) months of consistently seeing
Patient A, who complained of suprapubic abdominal pain on multiple visits with Respondent; 2)
failed to order any timely diagnostic tests of Patient A’s middle to lower abdomen; 3) when he
prescribed narcotic pain medications at nearly every visit in 2019 and through the early months of
2020 despite Patient A providing no symptomology to support the continued prescriptions; and 4)
when he failed to promptly consult or refer Patient A to an OB/GYN despite Patient A’s prior
history of uterine and ovarian tumors.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IL
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

22. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

23. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

24. — Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by, among other things, not documenting an accurate physical

examination of Patient A. Respondent continued to prescribe narcotic pain medication to

Patient A without documenting any medical reasoning or diagnosis for it. Thus, Respondent’s
medical records of Patient A were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT Tit
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation

26. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

27. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

28. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seck consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

29. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with an OB/GYN, general surgeon or}
radiologist with regard to Patient A’s medical condition from April 8, 2019, through February 8,
2021. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care provider to address Patient A’s
history of uterine and ovarian tumors with complaints of suprapubic pain. A timely consultation
with an OB/GYN, general surgeon, or radiologist would have likely located the tumor earlier and

the diagnosis would have enhanced the quality of medical care provided to the Patient A.

30. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.
WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early

Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and

premises.
