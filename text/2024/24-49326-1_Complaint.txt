AVM, which would entail blocking blood supply to the AVM. Patient A also agreed to the
performance of a Wada-Milner Test prior to the embolization, to evaluate for eloquence and avoid
potential complications during embolization.

5. Patient A returned to Respondent on June 10, 2020, where Respondent performed
the Wada-Milner Test. After this procedure, Respondent noted a negative selective pre-
embolization test.

6. Respondent then performed an embolization of the anterior right choroidal artery
on June 10, 2020. Respondent also embolized a branch off the right posterior cerebral artery, but
there is no record of a pre-embolization Wada-Milner Test done in this branch.

7. After the embolization procedures, images showed significantly decreased
posterior circulation on the right side of Patient A’s brain, indicating impending stroke.
Respondent’s post-surgical notes do not mention the significantly decreased posterior circulation.

8. Shortly after the procedures on June 10, 2020, Patient A suffered from seizures
with associated left side body weakness and peripheral visual loss.
