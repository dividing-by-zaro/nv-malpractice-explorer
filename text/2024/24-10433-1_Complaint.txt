wound closure and was transferred to Wellbrook Centennial Hills (Wellbrook) on
February 6, 2020, for medical and wound care management. At the time, his abdominal wound
was noted to be open and draining.

5. Additionally, after being transferred to Wellbrook, Patient A’s attending physician
planned to continue Patient A’s transfer medications, including antibiotic and antifungal.

6. During Patient A’s stay at Wellbrook his condition worsened, and he developed
fecal contamination of his abdominal wound.

7. Respondent first saw Patient A on or about February 10, 2020, for wound care
follow-up consultation. Respondent noted a large open surgical wound in the midline with
noticeable necrotic fatty tissue, and a mild odor. Respondent also noted that an infected wound
may have caused the dehiscence.

8. Respondent saw Patient A again on February 12, 2020, noted a mild odor, and
planned to place Patient A on negative-pressure wound therapy later that day. An infectious
disease physician also saw Patient A on February 12, 2020, and continued Patient A on
antibiotics.

9. On February 24, 2020, Respondent saw Patient A, noted a foul odor and an
infected wound, and noted a concern about an enterocutaneous fistula (fistula). Respondent did
not contact the infectious disease specialist who previously consulted with Patient A at Wellbrook.
Respondent did however recommend a surgical evaluation after noting his concern about a fistula.

10. Patient A’s abdominal wound continued to increase fecal output after
February 24, 2020. Respondent saw Patient A again on February 26, 2020, and March 2, 2020,
and both times noted concem over a fistula developing.

ll. On March 4, 2020, Respondent noted that a surgeon had conducted an evaluation
of Patient A, but that the surgeon did not provide any comments about a fistula. Because the
fistula was not noted, the surgeon recommended to stop the total parenteral nutrition, resume
feedings, and continue off antibiotics.

12. Respondent met with Patient A multiple times between February 12, 2020, and

March 4, 2020. During this timeframe, multiple labs were taken, showing abnormal findings

which possibly indicated developing inflammation and/or infection, such as elevated white blood
cell count (leukocytosis) and neutrophilia, elevated c-reactive protein, and elevated erythrocyte
sedimentation rate. However, Respondent did not acknowledge these abnormal lab findings in his
notes or document evaluation of the labs.

13. Respondent's notes further did not at any time indicate a recommendation or order
for a computed tomography (CT) scan to confirm the presence of the fistula, despite documenting
concern over the fistula.

14, Respondent’s notes further did not indicate any personal communication or
consultation with the infectious disease speciahst, the surgeon, or the attending internal medicine
physician, regarding Patient A's fistula, abdominal abscess, and/or abdominal wound infection.

15. On March 7, 2020, Patient A was found unresponsive and transferred to the
hospital. Patient A’s vital signs taken that day, including elevated temperature, low blood
pressure, and high heart rate, were consistent with sepsis.

16. Patient A was pronounced dead later that day, and the cause of death was noted as
cardiopulmonary arrest due to or as a consequence of an unknown etiology.
