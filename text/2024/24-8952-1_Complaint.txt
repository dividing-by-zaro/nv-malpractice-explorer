Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

COMPLAINT
The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(Board), by and through Donald K. White, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the
IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Reynold Louis Rimoldi, M.D. (Respondent) violated
the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating
the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 6287). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 1, 1991.

2. Patient A? was a 72-year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On May 4, 2016, Patient A was initially seen and evaluated by Respondent with
complaints of back pain and lower extremity pain. Respondent reviewed Patient A’s previous
MRI dated July 18, 2015, that revealed lumbar canal stenosis, degenerative joint disease, and a
disc protrusion at the L4-LS level. Respondent then ordered a new MRI of the spine and
uy

1 The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Carl N. Williams, Jr.,
M.D., and Col Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.).

7 Patient A’s identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy but is disclosed in the Patient Designation
served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint

scheduled Patient A for an L2-L5 laminectomy with an L4-L5 transforaminal lumbar interbody
fusion.

4. On May 12, 2016, Patient A received an MRI of the lumbar spine in preparation for
her surgery. The new study confirmed the multi-level neuroforaminal stenosis.

5. On June 17, 2016, Respondent performed an L2-L5 (lumbar spinal location)
decompressive laminectomy procedure followed by an L4-LS fusion for degenerative L4-L5
spondylolisthesis.

6. On June 18, 2016, Respondent evaluated Patient A and noted she was stable and
had movement in both lower extremities with sensation. Patient A was then transferred to the
hospitalist to follow her care until she was discharged. On this same date, Patient A suffered a
narcotics overdose and became confused, disoriented, and hypotensive and was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Patient A’s blood pressure dropped, which was thought to be related to
a hemorthage, and subsequently, underwent a blood transfusion. Respondent did not retum or
further evaluate Patient A until July 6, 2016.

7. On July 6, 2016, Respondent evaluated Patient A and noted a neurological status
change during her post-operative follow-up visit on June 18, 2016. Respondent found that Patient
A had diffuse weakness in her lower extremities. Despite the knowledge of the neurological status
change, Respondent did not order any further diagnostic studies or imaging to explain and identify
the causes of Patient A’s diminished neurological function and weakness in her lower extremities.
Respondent failed to pursue MRI or CT testing during this visit in furtherance of evaluating
Patient A’s medical condition postoperatively.

8. On July 18, 2016, Respondent evaluated Patient A and noted her wound from the
operation was doing well. There was no consideration of pursuing any revision surgery by
Respondent. Respondent, again, did not evaluate Patient A’s lumbar spine and did not investigate
the etiology of the diffuse weakness involving her lower extremities. Once more, Respondent
failed to pursue MRI or CT testing during this visit in furtherance of evaluating the etiology of|
Patient A’s new neurologic deficits.

9. Patient A sought a second opinion and obtained a postoperative MRI which
demonstrated a large evolved epidural hematoma at the surgical site with canal stenosis associated
with the hematoma. Ultimately Patient A had a revision surgery in November of 2016 with
evacuation of the fluid collected in the epidural space.
COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

10. All the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

11. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

12, NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a

patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

13. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent
committed malpractice with respect to the treatment of Patient A when he, on July 6, 2016, and
again on July 18, 2016, failed to order any diagnostic studies, including an MRI or CT scan, for
Patient A who demonstrated diminished neurologic function and diffuse weakness in her lower
extremities.

14. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IT
NRS 630.306(1)(g) - Continual Failure to Exercise Skill or Diligence

15. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

16. Continual failure by the Respondent to exercise the skill or diligence or use the
methods ordinarily exercised under the same circumstances by physicians in good standing
practicing in the same specialty or field is grounds for disciplinary action against a licensee
pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(g).

17. Respondent continually failed to exercise skill or diligence or use the methods
ordinarily exercised under the same circumstances by physicians in good standing, practicing in
the same specialty or field, as demonstrated by his repeated failure to order diagnostic testing in
Patient A who was experiencing worsening neurologic deficits and diffuse weakness following a
decompressive laminectomy procedure at both post-operative follow-up visits on July 6, 2016,
and again on July 18, 2016, respectively.

18. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

INT
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation

19. All the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein,

20. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

21. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

22. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation regarding Patient A’s medical
condition (diminished neurological status and diffuse weakness of the lower extremities) from
July 6, 2016, through July 18, 2016. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care
provider to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition and such a
timely consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and could have enhanced
the quality of medical care delivered to Patient A. Due to Patient A’s neurological status change
documented on July 6, 2016 and again on July 18, 2016, Respondent should have proceeded with
a diagnostic workup with the goal of explaining the etiology behind the deterioration in the
neurologic status and diffuse weakness of the lower extremities of Patient A.

23. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
