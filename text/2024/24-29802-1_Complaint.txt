COMPLAINT

The Investigative Commuttee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Alexander J. Hinman, Deputy General Counsel and attomey for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that David Carl Leppla, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

L Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 11236). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on November 30, 2004.

Zz Patient A? was a fifty-nine (59) year-old female at the time of the events at issue

3. On March 13, 2017, Patient A first presented to Respondent at Sierra Neurosurgery
Group (SNG) with complaints of neck pain radiating into her shoulder, episodically, as well as
weakness in her upper left extremity with numbness and tingling in her neck.

4. Respondent examined Patient A and noted that he found no weakness, but that she

exhibited a decreased sensation to pinpricks in the first three (3) digits of her left hand.

} The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Victor M. Muro, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ahsan,
M.D., Ph.D, FACC, and Ms. Pamela J. Beal.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but 1s disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. Respondent reviewed a cervical spine MRI scan that was performed at
Northeastern Nevada Regional Hospital and noted that there was severe stenosis of the central
canal and bilateral foraminal stenosis at multiple levels. As a result, Respondent recommended
that Patient A undergo a C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, to which
Patient A agreed to the procedure.

6. On March 30, 2017, Patient A underwent surgery for the aforementioned
procedure; however, when she awoke, she experienced profound weakness of the right deltoid
muscle, as documented by the operating room nurse. The operating room nurse then placed a call
to Respondent, among others, to come bedside to assess Patient A. Respondent then ordered a CT
scan of Patient A’s neck.

7. An A.P.N. noted in the Discharge Summary that “Postoperatively, in the recovery
room, [Patient A] had difficulty moving her arm, and that it appeared to be a right C5 nerve root
palsy”,

8. On March 30, 2017, at 3:35 p.m., Patient A underwent a CT scan of the neck by
order of the Respondent via a phone call with the attending OR Nurse. The CT report, drafted by
another doctor, stated “[aJnterior and sideplate hardware at C4 is noted along the right aspect of
the vertebral body with the right sided screw traversing the foramen transversarium and extending
to the neural foramen. At CS, the sideplate and screw hardware is noted along the right aspect of
the vertebral body with the right-sided screw coursing within the medial aspect of the foramen
transversarium.” This doctor stated that he had called Respondent and was awaiting a call back.

9. On March 30, 2017, a 4:34 p.m., a CT angiogram (CTA) report made by another
doctor at SNG stated that in his impression, “1. Anterior C4-7 fusion. Right-sided screws extend
into the medial margins of the right transverse foramina at the C4 and CS levels. The right
vertebral artery at these levels appear (sic) opacified.”

10. On March 30, 2017, at 5:10 p.m., a nurse attending to Patient A noted that she
called Dr. Leppla and he stated“... okay to send to floor, CTA negative.”

11. Upon information and belief, as stated in the above paragraphs, the CTA was not

negative, and Patient A was in-need of additional care.

12. There is no evidence that Respondent ever saw or examined Patient A after
surgery, on March 30, 2017. If Respondent had seen Patient A in the recovery room, then it
would have been incumbent on him to document a detailed neurological exam with an emphasis
on exactly the motor and sensory deficits, and the presence of Horner’s syndrome.

13. On March 31, 2017, at 8:02 a.m., an APN documented Patient A’s absence of any
right deltoid movement and weakness of the biceps and triceps.

14, On March 31, 2017, another cervical MRI was completed and the radiologist
reported “C4-5 level minimal central posterior spurring which abuts the ventral surface of the
cord. Mild central canal stenosis. Severe left-sided neural foraminal stenosis and moderate right-
sided neural foraminal stenosis.” The report goes on to note that there was severe bilateral
foraminal stenosis at C5-6 and C6-7.

15. On April 17, 2017, another doctor at SNG saw Patient A in a follow-up visit, which
was the only post-operative visit that Patient A had with Respondent’s neurosurgery group. This
doctor noted that Patient A “has neuropathic pain in that right arm not really getting any deltoid or
biceps function. At this point in time, I am going to start her on Neurontin 330 t.id...[and] we

will have her followup (sic) with Dr. Leppla in the next Elko clinic that is here.” Lastly, he writes,

“[hJopefully in time this palsy will improve.”

16. On September 18, 2017, Patient A was seen by a neurosurgeon at the University of
Utah Hospital. The doctor noted the continued problems with the use of Patient A’s right arm and
hand, including dexterity issues. Patient A was also noted to be suffering from Homer's
syndrome, which resulted in right-eye ptosis and decreased pupil size. A CTA was ordered,
which demonstrated the extension of the C4 surgical screw into the foramen transversarium, as
well as displacement and flattening of the vertebral artery.

17. Respondent acknowledged that Patient A suffered a severe right C5 palsy in his
response to the Board on June 27, 2021, stating “[iJn the recovery room it was noted that she
could not elevate her right arm with weakness in the deltoid muscle and biceps.” Further,
Respondent states that “[dJespite my best efforts, I did misplace the C4 and C5 screws.”
