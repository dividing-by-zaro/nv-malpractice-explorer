ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION AND NOTICE OF HEARING

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board) hereby IMMEDIATELY SUMMARILY SUSPENDS the license of
Hisbay Haider Ali, M.D. (Respondent) to practice medicine in the State of Nevada, pursuant to the
Board’s authority to regulate the practice of medicine in the State of Nevada pursuant to Nevada
Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630.

The IC issues this Order of Summary Suspension (Order) based on its determination that
Respondent’s acts put the health, safety or welfare, of the public at risk of imminent or continued
harm pursuant to NRS 630.326(1).

Prior to the preparation of this Order, Board Staff presented to the IC the following:

1. Respondent is a medical doctor licensed to practice medicine in the State of
Nevada (License No. 20660). The Board issued his license on December 31, 2020.

2. On March 18, 2024, the IC filed a formal complaint against Respondent alleging
the following:

a. On or about March 14, 2022, and March 15, 2022, Respondent engaged in
sexual intercourse with a patient (Patient A). Prior to the sexual relationship, Respondent sent the
patient a text message to her cell phone utilizing his personal cell phone and initiated an

inappropriate conversation to seduce Patient A into a sexual relationship with him.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners is composed of Board
members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Chairman, Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.)., and Hugh L. Bassewitz, M.D., FAAOS.

b. On March 18, 2022, Respondent visited a nightclub with Patient A and an
associate of Respondent. Respondent began drinking heavily and informed his associate that he
was the treating psychiatrist of Patient A and that he had diagnosed her as manic.

c. On the same date, Patient A attempted to end her sexual relationship with
Respondent. Respondent repeatedly sent text messages to her and threatened to show up at her
residence. Despite multiple requests by Patient A to be left alone, she ultimately resorted to
texting Respondent that she would call the police if he persisted.

d. From March 19, 2022, through March 21, 2022, Respondent sent flowers
and “love letters” on three (3) separate occasions to Patient A’s residence as well as, on one (1)
occasion, personally delivered flowers to Patient A’s residence.

e. Respondent ceased treating Patient A at his practice after this encounter and
failed to make any arrangements or referrals for her continuity of care, including ensuring she
would not have withdrawals from her medications or a way to refill her prescriptions.

3. In a second formal complaint filed on April 24, 2024, the IC alleged the following:

a. On November 16, 2021, Respondent began seeing a patient (Patient B) for
psychiatric care following Patient B’s transfer from another provider in the Respondent’s practice.
Respondent continued to see Patient B for a period of six (6) months following this initial
encounter. During this time, Respondent never ran a prescription monitoring program report
(PMP) for Patient B, as required by Nevada law prior to prescribing Patient B with
benzodiazepines, a Schedule IV controlled substance.

b. PMP data showed Patient B was concurrently being prescribed opioids
during his treatment with Respondent which is contraindicated. Respondent failed to address
Patient B’s opioid use in his medical records, taper down Patient B’s benzodiazepine usage, or
switch Patient B to a longer acting medication such as clonazepam. Respondent’s notes during
the remainder of Patient B’s visits continued to be highly templated and contained identical

subjective and mental status exams which included repeated spelling errors, all of which indicate
the records were cloned.

4, On July 3, 2024, the Investigations Division of the Board obtained a Criminal
History Report following the fingerprint and a background waiver required under NRS 630.342
and related to Respondent’s prior formal complaints.

5. The Investigative Committee learned from the Criminal History Report that on or
about December 18, 2022, Respondent was arrested for domestic violence following an altercation
with a romantic partner.

6. Respondent failed to report this arrest to the Board within thirty (30) days as
required by NRS 630.306(1)(1).

7. Respondent submitted his renewal application on June 21, 2023, wherein he
answered “no” to the question in the renewal application of whether the Respondent had ever been
arrested, investigated, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to any offense or violation of any federal
law (including the Uniform Code of Military Justice), state or local law, or the laws of any foreign
country which is a misdemeanor, gross misdemeanor, felony, violation of the Uniform Code of
Military Justice, or synonymous thereto in a foreign jurisdiction, excluding any minor traffic
offense (driving or being in control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of a chemical
substance, including alcohol is not considered a minor traffic offense), or for any offense which is
related to the manufacture, distribution, prescribing, or dispensing of controlled substances.

8. Respondent’s renewal application for his Nevada medical license was approved on
or about June 27, 2023, without critical review of his criminal history.

9. Additionally, the Criminal History Report showed that on or about April 6, 2024,
Respondent was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Respondent was
involved in a single-person vehicle accident. While driving at a high rate of speed, Respondent
collided with a curb causing the vehicle to roll over. Respondent had a blood alcohol volume of
.273 grams per milliliter at the time of his arrest.

10. Respondent failed to report this DUI arrest to the Board within thirty (30) days as
required by NRS 630.306(1)(1).

11. Accordingly, the IC finds that the health, safety and welfare of the public is at

imminent or continued risk of harm if Respondent is permitted to continue practicing medicine,

PMP; (3) Respondent submitted for biennial registration (renewal) of his medical license utilizing
