COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(Board), by and through Donald K. White, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Srivathsa Chelur Veeraraghavan, M.D. (Respondent)
violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative
Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint,
stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 18826). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on April 18, 2019.

2. Patient A? was a forty-cight (48) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. On October 13, 2019, Patient A fell on his right hand and was taken to Sunrise
Hospital for evaluation of the injury.

5. Respondent reviewed the three (3) views of X-rays and found no evidence of
dislocation or fracture from his review of the tests. This information was provided in a report to the
emergency room physician.

6. The emergency room physician discharged Patient A, and based on Respondent's
report, placed Patient A in a splint and asked Patient A to follow up with an orthopedic physician
and his primary care physician.

7. On October 26, 2019, additional X-rays were taken by his primary care provider.
These X-rays indicated a dorsal fracture dislocation of the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones and an
avulsion fracture.

8. The X-rays taken at Sunrise Hospital actually demonstrated the same changes as the
October 26, 2019, X-rays —a clear dorsal dislocation of the fourth and fifth carpometacarpal joints
with an adjacent avulsion fracture.

9. Patient A’s injuries could not be timely or properly addressed in the hospital due to
reliance by the emergency room physician on the incorrect reading of the Sunrise Hospital
X-rays by Respondent.

10. Patient A was later referred to an orthopedic physician by his primary care doctor
once the correct reading of the October 26, 2019, X-rays was obtained.
