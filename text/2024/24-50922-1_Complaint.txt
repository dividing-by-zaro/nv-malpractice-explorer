In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 24-50922-1
Against: FILED

MOHAMMED MERAJUL HOQUE, M.D.,
MAY 13 2024
Respondent.

NEVADA SJATE BOARD OF
MED} MINERS
COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Donald K. White, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the
IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Mohammed Merajul Hoque, M.D. (Respondent)
violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada
Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues
its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 19019). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 1, 2019.

2. Patient A? was a fifty-six (56) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. Patient A had a CTA scan of her abdomen on September 16, 2020, which
incidentally revealed a 2.8 cm right renal mass, suspicious for renal cell cancer.

4. Patient A was referred to a urologist who ordered ultrasound imaging that was
performed on October 13, 2020, and confirmed a 3 cm right renal mass.

Ww

} The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
‘Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Victor M. Muro, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ahsan,
M.D., Ph.D., FAC, and Ms. Pamela J. Beal.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. The urologist ordered a right-sided kidney biopsy for Patient A to cither confirm or
deny the diagnosis of malignant tissue on or around the right kidney.

6. On November 13, 2020, Patient A presented to Henderson Hospital for a night renal
mass surgical biopsy, in which the order and ultrasound specified the location of the mass on the
right kidney.

7. Just before the biopsy surgery on November 13, 2020, at 8:52 a.m., Respondent
called a timeout to ensure that the surgical team was aware of the correct surgery, the correct
location of the surgery on Patient A’s body, and there appeared to be no issues noted in the time
out.

8 Twenty-one (21) minutes later at 9:13 a.m. the order for the right renal biopsy was
cancelled and at the exact same time (9:13 a.m.) an order for a left renal biopsy was created,
presumably at the direction of Respondent.

9. Upon information and belief, Respondent changed or requested a change to the
original order from Patient A’s urologist of a right renal mass biopsy to a left renal biopsy because
Respondent somehow mistakenly concluded that Patient A was there for a medical renal biopsy
(for renal failure) and believed either kidney was suitable for the biopsy.

10. Respondent’s surgical notes indicated that he had compared the ultrasound from
October 13, 2020, as ordered by Patient A’s urologist, and was using it as guidance in the biopsy
procedure. However, the October 13, 2020, ultrasound clearly indicated that Patient A had a mass
on her right kidney, not the left kidney which was biopsied on November 13, 2020.

11. In a follow-up visit with her urologist, he informed Patient A that Respondent
biopsied her left kidney instead of the right kidney. Patient A opted out of having another biopsy
and opted for surgery.

12. On December 17, 2020, Patient A underwent a right robotic radical nephrectomy.

14. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

15. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

16. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he biopsied the otherwise healthy left kidney of Patient A when the ultrasound images and report
clearly indicated that a right renal mass needed to be biopsied.

17. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IH
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Proper Medical Records

18. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

19. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

20. Respondent failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A, by either presumably directing the alteration of the
original order from Patient A’s urologist for a right renal biopsy to a left renal biopsy and/or by
failing to acknowledge and document that the biopsy was to be performed on the right kidney and
justification of his medical decision to change the surgical procedure to the left kidney.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation

22 Allof the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

23. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

24. — NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of,
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

25. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition on November 13, 2020, and Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care
provider to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition and such a
timely consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and may have enhanced the
quality of medical care provided to the patient. If Respondent was unsure or unaware of the
underlying purpose for the order for the right vs. left kidney biopsy, he should have contacted
Patient A’s other providers, especially the ordering physician, who could have clarified that the
biopsy was for a right renal mass before changing the order from right-sided surgery to left-sided
surgery.

26. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IV
NRS 630.306(1)(r) - Failure to Adequately Supervise a Medical Assistant

27. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set
forth herein.

28. NRS 630.306(1)(r) provides that a failure to adequately supervise a medical
assistant pursuant to the regulations of the Board is an act that constitutes grounds for initiating
disciplinary action.
