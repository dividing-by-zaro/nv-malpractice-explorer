RAYMOND MARK TURNER, M.D., JAN 22. 2004

Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
MEDICALSXAMINE!

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through its counsel, Alexander J. Hinman, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for
the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Raymond Mark Turner, M.D., (Respondent)
violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative
Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint,
stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 6140). Respondent was originally
licensed by the Board on December 1, 1990, with a specialty in Obstetrics/Gynecology

2. Patient A? was a forty-two (42) year-old pregnant female at the time of the events
at issue, and had a benign tumor of corpus uteri, and unspecified ovarian cysts.

3. On November 6, 2019, Patient A, who was twelve (12) weeks pregnant at the time,
presented to the High-Risk Pregnancy Center (HRPC) for an ultrasound to monitor the cysts and
the health of the pregnancy due to the increased risk of complications of an elderly multigravida

pregnancy (expectants who are thirty-five (35) years old or over and have been pregnant before).

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Carl N. Williams, Jr.,
M.D., FACS, Col. Eric D. Wade, (Ret.).

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4. Results of the ultrasound showed multiple complex ovarian cysts, where the right
ovarian cyst was measured approximately 7.8 cm x 6.9 cm x 4.1 cm, and the left ovarian cyst
measured approximately 6.8 cm x 5.5 cm x 4.6 cm.

5. On December 5, 2019, Patient A presented to Respondent for an initial consultation
for complex bilateral adnexal masses found in conjunction with a sixteen (16) week pregnancy.
Respondent documented that Patient A had simple cysts; however, the November 6, 2019, scan at
HRPC, described both masses as complex. Further, there was no documentation of a physical
exam performed on Patient A, no formal report of the ultrasound images, or any statement that
Respondent reviewed the images, ordered images, or performed any additional imaging. There
was also no differential diagnosis of the masses discussed.

6. On December 11, 2019, Patient A, now seventeen (17) weeks pregnant, was seen
for a second consultation and an ultrasound at HPRC. The maternal fetal medical physician
observed again and documented the presence of complex bilateral cysts. Both ovarian masses
appeared stable in size when viewed in conjunction with the previous visit. Patient A was advised
to discuss the adnexal masses with Respondent.

7. On December 11, 2019, Patient A had a follow-up appointment with Respondent.
Respondent counseled Patient A on the option of surgical intervention for possible malignancy
versus watchful waiting. Patient A elected to proceed with surgical intervention. Of note, there
was no mention of a pelvic exam in Patient A’s medical records, there was a vague record of an
abdominal exam that stated, “uterine size consistent with her gestational age,” and there was no
record of Respondent ever reviewing the ultrasound images.

8. On December 16, 2019, Patient A underwent a laparoscopy with amniotomy, a
laparotomy with repair of amniotomy, lysis of adhesions, and drainage of cysts. Respondent
failed to perform an exam under anesthesia prior to the procedure.

9. Respondent failed to detail the surgical technique used, the size of the trocar, and
the size of the amniotomy. Because of Patient A’s anatomy, the ovaries were not able to be fully
visualized, and the laparoscopic procedure was converted to an open laparotomy.

10. On December 18, 2019, Patient A experienced a gush of fluid and blood vaginally,
consistent with a diagnosis of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). As a result,
Patient A went to the hospital.

11. | On December 18, 2019, Respondent counseled Patient A on management options
of the PPROM along with endometriosis, and on December 20, 2019, Respondent performed a
total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral ovarian cystectomies with ovarian
repair, transposition of the ovaries, and an appendectomy, which resulted in the loss of the
pregnancy. Patient A was discharged four (4) days later.

to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A when he failed to perform a pelvic exam and correctly
document the size of the pregnant uterus, which in turn led to a uterine perforation at the time of
the initial trocar placement during robotic surgery. Respondent further failed to modify his
surgical technique for consideration of a gravid uterus by altering the standard robotic insertion
site of the first trocar or using an open technique.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

24. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document that he reviewed the ultrasound

images taken at the HRPC on November 6, 2019, and December 11, 2019, ordered further

imaging, or performed additional imaging himself. There was also no discussion of a differential
diagnosis of the masses in the operative reports. Lastly, Respondent failed to maintain complete
medical records by not mentioning an exam under anesthesia prior to the December 16, 2019,
procedure, not describing the exact technique used during the procedure, and not recording of the
size of the trocar used or the size of the amniotomy.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
