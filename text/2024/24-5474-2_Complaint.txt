COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Donald K, White, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attomey for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Andrew Jackson Welch, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 3713). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on December 2, 1978.

4. On or about May 19, 2018, Patient A was transferred from Kingman Regional
Medical Center in Kingman, Arizona to Desert Springs Hospital (“DSH”) in Las Vegas, Nevada

and was evaluated by an APRN at DSH for abnormal left leg pain and a swollen left foot.

tive Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Victor M. Muro, M.D., Ms. April Mastroluca,

5. On or about May 23, 2018, Respondent was consulted as a surgeon on Patient A’s
condition. Patient A was diagnosed with an arterial occlusion of the left lower extremity and
underwent a left below-knee amputation on May 29, 2018, by Respondent. Patient A was then
discharged by DSH on June 4, 2018, under the care of a home health practitioner.

6. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not document his review of any
testing and failed to document whether or not he had a conversation with Patient A about the risks
and benefits of the proposed amputation of her left lower extremity.

7. In Respondent’s allegation response he indicated there was contact made by
Respondent, or his office, with Patient A on June 11, 2018, June 18, 2018, June 20, 2018, and
July 2, 2018. On July 9, 2018, the home health practitioner advised Respondent that they sent
Patient A to the emergency room due to concerns of septic shock from her wounds from the
amputation.

8. Patient A arrived at Kingman Regional Medical Center on July 9, 2018, by
ambulance with purulent drainage from her wound and pain secondary to ischemic necrosis at the
amputation site. She was then transferred back to DSH under the care of Respondent.

%. On July 12, 2018, at 1:48 p.m. Respondent performed a debridement of Patient A’s.
necrotic tissue using Bupivacaine, a local anesthetic while Patient A was complaining of pain.
The entire surgery consisted of local anesthetic delivery and sharp dissection of the eschar at the
amputation site.

10. According to medical records, the surgery began at 1:48 p.m. and was completed
by 2:01 p.m., thirteen (13) minutes after Respondent began the surgery, not allowing enough time
for the local anesthetic to become effective before performing the debridement of the wound.
Additionally, there was no documentation as to Respondent's reasoning to elect local anesthetic
versus the use of an anesthesiologist and general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or deep sedation.

11. Portions of DSH operative records indicate that a local anesthetic was used, but in
the narrative about the technique in the Operative Report presumably written by Respondent, the
record states “general” anesthesia was used. Meanwhile in Respondent’s records, the same
