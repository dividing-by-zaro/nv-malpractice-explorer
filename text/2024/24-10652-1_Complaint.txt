Respondent prescribed Patient A Xanax in the amount of Img twice daily.

4. Respondent continued to see Patient A from June 2017 through January 2021 on no
less than twenty (20) follow-up visits. Respondent failed to regularly to screen Patient A for:
safety to discuss potential side effects of the medication prescribed by Respondent. On each visit,

Respondent documented a templated generic mental status examination at each visit stating:

“No suicidal or homicidal ideation. Patient is seen to have well-delineated
futuristic thoughts and plans. The patienvor legal guardian gave informed consent
for the proposed medical treatment after careful evaluation of the risk/benefit
analysis involved, as well as alternative treatment options. The patient and/or legal
guardian was informed of potential side effects and what to do should they arise.
The patient and/or legal guardian is aware of developing TD? and understands that
TD can be permanent, disfiguring disabling and rarely lethal.”

Respondent’s note regarding Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) does not apply to Patient A’s treatment, as
she was not being treated with antipsychotic drugs and is indicative of his cloned medical records

history, any evaluation of mental status, no screening for homicidal ideation, and no diagnosis or
treatment plan for the patient. Furthermore, Respondent failed to document a discussion of the
risks or benefits of the medication, and any alternatives, as would be required in the process of|
obtaining informed consent.

7. Between the dates of January 4, 2021, and February 12, 2021, Respondent
documented seeing as many as forty (40) patients per day despite utilizing the medical billing time
code “99214” which denotes a forty-five (45) minute patient visit.

8. On January 4, 2021, Respondent was scheduled to see patients between 9:30 a.m.
