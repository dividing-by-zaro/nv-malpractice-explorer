By:

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),

COMPLAINT

by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Kalyan Chakravarthy Tatineny, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 14773). Respondent was originally
licensed by the Board on April 22, 2013.

2. Patient A? was a thirty-four (34) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On March 13, 2018, Patient A presented to the emergency department at St. Rose
Dominican Hospital Siena Campus (St. Rose Hospital). Patient A reported that she had a
chiropractic neck adjustment earlier in the day and afterwards experienced neck pain, dizziness, and
vomiting.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF
(Ret.), and Carl N. Williams, Jr., M.D., FACS.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient

4. Patient A then underwent a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of her head and
neck. Respondent, a radiologist, interpreted the CTA results on March 13, 2018. In his report,
Respondent noted that Patient A’s basilar artery and posterior cerebral arteries were unremarkable
and that Patient A’s right and left common carotid arteries were normal. Respondent’s report
concluded with an impression of “[n]o acute brain or neck CTA abnormality.”

5. However, the CTA scan clearly demonstrated a change in caliber of the right distal
vertebral artery. Given Patient A’s recent history of neck adjustment, her symptoms reported upon
presentation at St. Rose Hospital, and the CTA scan results, Patient A demonstrated a high suspicion
of vertebral artery dissection. Respondent failed to identify or note in his report a possible vertebral
artery dissection.

6. Patient A was discharged from St. Rose Hospital on March 14, 2018, with
instructions on how to manage her symptoms.

7. On March 16, 2018, Patient A underwent an MRI of her head and neck. Another
physician interpreted the MRI results and included in his report an impression of “dissection of the
right distal cervical vertebral artery.”

8. That same day, Patient A returned to St. Rose Hospital where a neurologist reviewed
Patient A’s CTA from March 13, 2018, as well as the MRI conducted on March 16, 2018. The

neurologist noted that the March 13, 2018, CTA demonstrated a focal right vertebral artery

dissection.
COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice
9. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

reference as though fully set forth herein.

10. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

ll. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.”

12. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A by failing to identify and note a possible vertebral artery
dissection on Patient A’s CTA scan from March 13, 2018.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2) within
twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early Case
Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been a
violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4, That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this case
as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact, conclusions
of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and

6. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these
premises.
