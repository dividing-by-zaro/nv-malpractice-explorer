4. On February 22, 2020, a pediatric pulmonologist performed a bronchoscopy on
Patient A, due to mucus plugging, partial collapsed lung, and respiratory insufficiency. Due to
oxygen desaturation following this procedure, Respondent, a pediatric intensivist, emergently
performed an endotracheal intubation on Patient A.

5. Respondent documented that she performed the intubation with a 4.5 sized cuffed
endotracheal tube.

6. A 4.5 sized cuffed endotracheal tube is typically recommended for children two to.
three years of age, and not three (3) month-old children such as Patient A The use of an
endotracheal tube that is too large carries a significant risk factor for the development of subglottic
stenosis (narrowing of the airway below the vocal cords and above the trachea).

7. After the February 22, 2020, procedure, Patient A remained intubated at Sunrise
Hospital.

8. Respondent documented that she evaluated Patient A later in the day on
February 22, 2020, after performing the intubation. Respondent also documented that she
evaluated Patient A on February 24, 2020.

9. During these two (2) visits, Respondent did not document the size of Patient A’s
intubation tube and failed to document the tube cuff pressures and presence or absence of an air
leak around the endotracheal tube.

10. On March 4, 2020, another pediatric intensivist extubated Patient A and placed her
on high flow nasal cannula. Due to increased labored breathing and upper airway stridor, this
pediatric intensivist removed the 4.5 sized endotracheal tube and re-intubated Patient A with a
smaller, 3.5 sized tube. The pediatric intensivist noted that Patient A was originally intubated
with a 4.5 sized endotracheal tube.

11. On March 20, 2020, Sunrise Hospital staff noted that Patient A was in stable
condition and discharged Patient A with instructions for close interval follow-up and return
precautions.

12 On March 26, 2020, Patient A was re-admitted to Sunrise Hospital with respiratory
distress. During this admission, Patient A received a tracheostomy and was noted to have severe
granulation obstructing the airway. Patient A was subsequently diagnosed with subglottic
stenosis, scarring of the posterior vocal cords, scarred arytenoids, and the need for airway
reconstruction.
