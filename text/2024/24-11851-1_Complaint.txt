enough that Patient A required assistance with daily living and that she had a limited range of
motion in general.

5. Beginning October 11, 2021, and forward thereafter, Respondent was the
responsible care provider for Patient A at all times relevant to this Complaint.

6. On November 8, 2021, Patient A was found on the floor by a CNA, which noted
that she discovered Patient A lying on the floor after she fell from her bed. Patient A then had to
be assisted into a chair. Respondent was notified of this event and ordered to continue monitoring.

7. Respondent’s subsequent progress notes contained only limited documentation of a
musculoskeletal exam, and that section of the exam remained identical to previous notes in
multiple subsequent medical notes.

8. On November 13, 2021, Patient A was seen by a RN, who documented that
Patient A’s daughter had reported that Patient A had “bilateral lower extremity pain” and a
“limited range of motion.” Upon learning this information, the RN ordered a right hip x-ray and a
lower extremity doppler.

9. On November 13, 2021, the results of the imaging were reported, with the
radiologist commenting that there was a “minimally impacted fracture of femoral neck,” and an
“acute right hip [fracture].”

10. On November 14, 2021, Respondent saw Patient A and noted in his assessment,
that Patient A had a physical debility, hypertension, cognitive disorder, “pain of right lower
extremity: improved continue symptomatic treatment,” seizure disorder, anemia, and dysphagia.
Absent from the assessment, was any discussion of the acute right hip fracture, and Respondent
failed to take action to treat the fracture.

11. On November 15, 2021, a nurse ordered Patient A’s transfer to a Las Vegas
emergency room for treatment of a right hip fracture.

13. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

14. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

15. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, when he failed to recognize that Patient A had an acute
fracture, despite being notified that Patient A had fallen, and further failed to examine or perform
an assessment addressing the fracture following her fall. Respondent further failed to discover,
acknowledge, or follow up on the review of Patient A’s x-ray results as her responsible care
provider, which led to a delay in the recognition and treatment of her right hip fracture.

16. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT I
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

17. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

18. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

19. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions when he treated
Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete, when
Respondent failed to document Patient A’s acute right hip fracture, and Patient A’s progress notes
contained only limited documentation of a musculoskeletal exam, which appeared with identical
verbiage on multiple, subsequent records.
