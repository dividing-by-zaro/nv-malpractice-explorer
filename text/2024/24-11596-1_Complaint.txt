COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Alexander J. Hinman, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Szu Nien Yeh, M.D., (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 8126). Respondent was originally
licensed by the Board on March 18, 1997, and his specialty is listed as anesthesiology.

2. Patient A? was a fifty-seven (57) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On July 7, 2021, Patient A presented to Summerlin Hospital Medical Center for a
laparoscopic assisted hysterectomy and a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries
and fallopian tubes).

4. Respondent was the acting anesthesiologist for the procedure, and Patient A was

brought to the operating room at approximately 7:45 a.m. on July 7, 2021.

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Aury Nagy, M.D., Ms. Maggie Arias-Petrel,
and Nick M. Spirtos, M.D., F.A.C.O.G.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. Anesthesia was introduced shortly thereafter, with Propofol 200mg, Fentanyl
100mcg, and Rocuronium 50mg; a sedative, analgesic, and paralytic, respectively.

6. During the procedure, Respondent also used a Sevoflurane (Sevo) vaporizer, an
inhalation agent, in conjunction with the aforementioned medications.

7. A fundamental part of an anesthesiologist’s responsibilities are to inspect the
medical devices they are going to use to administer anesthesia before a procedure commences. As
such, the Sevo vaporizer needs to be examined prior to use, thus ensuring that it contains a
sufficient amount of Sevo for adequate delivery throughout the operation.

8. The preliminary check of the Sevo amount in the vaporizer is easily verified when
looking at the device, which prominently displays the amount of Sevo it contains. Furthermore,
this information can again be verified by the expired percentage of Sevo (“end tidal
concentration”), which is displayed and refreshes with an updated reading every six (6) seconds.

9. During the procedure, Respondent initially set the (Sevo) vaporizer at a 3% percent
setting; however, the Sevo only rose to 2% and quickly declined after fifteen (15) minutes. This
should have immediately put Respondent on alert that the vaporizer was empty, or near empty,
which was later found to be the case. Further, the end tidal concentrations showed amounts well
below this rate throughout the duration of the operation.

10. At 8:30 a.m., a surgical incision was performed. At this time, the end tidal
concentration of the Sevo was .74%. Over the next thirty (30) minutes the end tidal concentration
varied between .65% and .90%. These dips in Sevo concentration, reaching as low as .65%, made
it possible for Patient A to become conscious during the procedure.

11. During this same period, Patient A experienced several episodes of hypotension,
and it appears that Respondent responded to this by further lowering the Sevo concentration. This
resulted in a return of normal blood pressure: however, as a result of the Sevo concentration being
too low, it also caused Patient A to regain consciousness.

12. When Patient A regained consciousness she was unable to move because of the
muscle relaxant Rocuronium that she was given.

13. Respondent eventually switched to another inhaled agent, Desflurane, at
approximately 9:10 a.m., and also added 2mg of Versed, a powerful amnestic, indicating that he
was aware the end tidal concentrations were too low, and changes needed to be made to ensure
deep sedation; however, Patient A had been under-sedated for almost an hour.

14. Patient A later notified nursing staff of this incident and it was recorded that she
informed the nurse that she had awoken during the procedure; however, there is no documentation
of Respondent ever following up with Patient A or documenting this adverse event.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

15. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

16. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

17. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

18. | As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, when he failed to confirm the accurate amount of Sevo in
the vaporizer before inducing anesthesia, which was later found to be empty, and when he failed
to recognize that Patient A’s end tidal concentrations were too low to ensure deep sedation.

19, By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT It
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

20. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

21. — NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

22. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions when he treated
Patient A, whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete, when
Respondent failed to document the adverse event during Patient A’s procedure, and failed to
provide any follow-up notes documenting any discussion with Patient A after her procedure.

23. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
