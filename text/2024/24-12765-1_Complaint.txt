Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

MEDICAL EXAMINERS
By:

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Alexander J Hinman, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Ronald Stephen Hofflander, M.D. (Respondent) violated
the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the
IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1, Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 9075). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 9, 1999.

2. Patient A? was an eighty-two (82) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.
Of relevance, Patient A’s prior medical history includes surgery for a bilateral hernia in 1995,
removal of his colon in 2003, and an abdominal hernia repair in 2005.

3. On July 17, 2017, Patient A presented to Respondent for an evaluation of a hiatal
hernia and a left lower ventral hernia involving the descending colon.


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Col. Eric D. Wade, and
Carl N. Williams, Jr., M.D.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4, Respondent recommended laparoscopic repair of the hiatal hernia (fundoplication)
and he would repair the incarcerated ventral hernia.

5. On September 12, 2017, Respondent performed the surgery on Patient A, using the
direct trocar technique with an OPTIVIEW trocar, even though Patient A had undergone previous
surgeries and had previous mesh placement, which put Patient A at a higher risk for adhesions.

6. Respondent’s Operative Report indicated there were “no complications,”
experienced during the operation.

7. On September 14, 2017, Patient A’s condition began deteriorating, as Patient A had
atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

8. On September 15, 2017, Patient A was having respiratory difficulty. Specifically,
Patient A was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, and had a partial pressure of oxygen (PO2)
reading of fifty-nine (59), well in excess of normal ranges.

9. On September 16, 2017, Patient A’s renal function had deteriorated. Records
indicate that Patient A’s Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) had elevated significantly, and his creatine
levels had almost tripled.

10. On September 18, 2017, Patient A’s condition deteriorated even further. Patient A
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where he was intubated, and a hemodialysis
catheter was placed. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen demonstrated a
probable intestinal leak.

11. On September 19, 2017, seven (7) days after the first surgery, Respondent took
Patient A back into surgery for an exploratory laparotomy. While performing the surgery,
Respondent found a hole in the small bowel with multiple fluid collections and abdominal
adhesions. Patient A was ultimately diagnosed with sepsis resulting from a perforated viscus.

12. Of note, there is no mention of ischemic changes or cautery burns found in
Respondent’s Operative Report; however, ischemic changes were found in the pathology report,
thus, ischemia would have been noticed at the time of surgery and should have been reported.

13. On September 25, 2017, Patient A was consulted by a hospice nurse and a

palliative care specialist. The hospice physician extubated the patient; however, Patient A did not

survive extubation, and was pronounced deceased shortly thereafter. The Certificate of Death
listed the cause of the death as sepsis due to a perforated small intestine following hernia repair.
COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

14. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

15. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

16. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

17. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, by using a riskier surgical technique than appropriate
when performing Patient A’s procedure, and by causing an unreasonable delay in diagnostic
testing to discover the intestinal leak after the first surgery. Additionally, Patient A had multiple
warning signs of a major problem and documented deterioration that went unrecognized and
untreated by Respondent in a reasonable amount of time.

18. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

19, All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

20. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

21. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by noting that there were “no complications” after performing the
first operation, and by failing to mention ischemic changes or cautery burns in the Operative
Report of the second operation.

22. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and

6. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these
premises.
