Postoperative distortion in the right breast seen. Some benign-appearing left breast calcifications
are seen.” The reading was that of BIRAD two (2): benign findings.

5. twas determined later when tests from 2010 through 2015 were reviewed and
compared with the test from October 7, 2016, that Patient A did im fact have changes to the breast
tissue at the time the mammogram was taken, that had been developing over time. Though the
changes were progressive, prominent, and asymmetrical, they should have been reported as floridly
abnormal. Further, there was a 15x15 millimeter conspicuous architectural distortion in the
10 o'clock posterior third of the right breast and radial, grouped, fine rod-like abnormal
calcifications.

6. The test should have been converted from a screening exam to a diagnostic exam or
should have been coded as BI-RAD zero (0), incomplete and recommendations should have been
made for completion of a diagnostic examination.

7. Over time, there was evidence of a progressive change in the regional/global
asymmetric density and a progressive volume loss of the right breast. This abnormality was not
identified as actionable by Respondent in his findings after review of the mammogram films.

to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, because Respondent compared images from 2010 through
2015, with an image from October 7, 2016, and Respondent should have acknowledged that the
