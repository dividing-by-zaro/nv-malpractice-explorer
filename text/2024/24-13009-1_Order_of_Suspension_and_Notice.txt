ORDER OF SUSPENSION AND NOTICE OF HEARING

The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board) hereby IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDS the license of Jon Lane Siems, M.D.
(Respondent) from the practice of medicine, pursuant to the Board’s authority to regulate the
practice of medicine in the State of Nevada pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS)
Chapter 630.

The IC issues this Order of Suspension (Order) based on its determination that Respondent

violated a Board Order when he did not satisfy all of the conditions contained in the discipline

issued by the Board after adjudication at the Board meeting on December 1, 2023. See Exhibit 1.

Prior to the preparation of this Order, Board Staff presented to the IC the following:

1. Respondent is a medical doctor licensed to practice medicine in the State of|
Nevada (License No. 9250). The Board issued his license on December 20, 1999.

2. On December 27, 2022, in Case No. 19-13009-2, the IC suspended Respondent’s
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada pending a show cause hearing regarding the
subject of that summary suspension via an Order of Summary Suspension.

3. On January 30, 2023, the IC filed a formal Complaint against Respondent in
Case No. 23-13009-1 which facts relate directly back to an Order issued in Case No. 19-13009-2.

4. On February 2, 2023, a show cause hearing was held regarding Respondent’s
suspension.

5. After attempts to serve Respondent with the formal Complaint on a previous date,
Respondent was served with the formal Complaint in Case 23-13009-1 on March 3, 2023.

6. On April 13, 2023, a formal hearing was held in Case No. 23-13009-1.

7. On December 1, 2023, the Board adjudicated the matter and found that Respondent
did indeed violate the single count of Knowing or Willful Failure to Comply with a Board Order,
as provided by NRS 630.3065(2)(a), and imposed discipline.

8. The discipline the Board imposed was a written public reprimand, that
Respondent’s license be suspended for a period of one (1) year from December 28, 2022 to
December 27, 2023, and on December 28, 2023, Respondent’s license status shall be reinstated to
an active-probation status; Respondent shall complete the University of San Diego Physician
Assessment and Competency Evaluation Program (PACE), Competency Assessment, or
substantially similar assessment by another entity approved by the Board within six (6) months of
issuance of the Order; that any continuing medical education received for attending the program
shall be in addition to the requirements that are regularly imposed upon Respondent as a condition
of licensure in the State of Nevada pursuant to NAC 630.153(1); and Respondent was required to
reimburse the Board the reasonable and necessary costs and expenses actually incurred in the
investigation and prosecution of this case in the amount of seven thousand four hundred and
ninety-nine dollars, and twenty cents ($7,499.20) within six (6) months of service of the Order.

9. Respondent received a deadline of June 1, 2024, to pay the fines and costs in
Case No. 23-13009-1.

10. Johnna LaRue, CMBI, Compliance Officer for the Board sent Respondent a letter
dated December 19, 2023, containing helpful instructions and deadlines to assist Respondent in
complying with the Board Order. See Exhibit 2.

11. As of today’s date, Respondent has not paid the costs in the amount of seven
thousand four hundred and ninety-nine dollars, and twenty cents ($7,499.20) and is therefore in

violation of the Board’s Order.

In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No.: 23-13009-1

Against (Case No.:19-13009-2)
JON L. SIEMS, M.D.,

Respondent.

SYNOPSIS AND ANALYSIS OF THE RECORD

Hearing Officer Charles B. Woodman, having heard a formal pre-hearing
conference, as well as the formal Hearing of this matter, hereby presents the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners with his formal Analysis of this case. This Analysis is based
‘upon all evidence adduced at the formal Hearing, this Hearing Officer's findings of facts
and conclusions of law, which findings include the credibility of the witnesses who gave
evidence.

RELEVANT BACKGROUND

This is a combined case as shown in the caption, whereby the Investigative
Committee (“IC") of the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of Nevada (“Board”)
alleged that Dr. Jon Lane Siems, M.D., (“Dr. Siems”) failed to comply with the Settlement
Agreement he entered into as resolution to Board Case 19-13009-2. The final page of that
Settlement Agreement contains the Board's order mandating compliance with the
Agreement. A duly noticed formal hearing of the matter was held before the undersigned
Hearing Officer on April 13, 2023 at the Northern Nevada office of the Board in Reno.
Mr. Donald K. White, Esq., Senior Deputy General Counsel appeared on behalf of the
Board’s IC. Dr. Siems appeared via videoconference from the Board’s Southem Nevada
office representing himself in pro se. The matter was duly recorded by a licensed reporter
and is a matter of public record,

al
13.

an

The formal Complaint in Board Case 23-13009-1 alleges a single count of
Knowing or Willful Failure to Comply with a Board Order, a violation of NRS
630.3065(2)(a), which states that:

The following acts, among others, constitute grounds for ini

action or denying licensure:
vee

1g disciplinary

2. Except as otherwise provided in NRS 630.2672, knowingly or willfully
failing to comply with:

(@) A regulation, subpoena or order of the Board or a committee designated
by the Board to investigate a complaint against a physician;

More specifically, the IC alleges at paragraphs 8-9 of the Complaint that:

8. Respondent (Dr. Siems] knowingly or willfully failed to comply with
an order of the Board when he failed to complete 20 hours of CMEs or the PACE
Program by or within the deadline he agree to with the Board [in Case 19-13009-
2).

9. Additionally, the Settlement Agreement [in Case 19-13009-2] that
Respondent signed and was subsequently approved by the Board clearly states
that Respondent agreed to be placed on stayed suspension and that if he violated
any terms of the agreement that the IC shall be authorized to immediately suspend
Respondent's license to practice medicine in Nevada pending an Order to Show
Cause hearing,

Accordingly, the two cases are inextricably linked inasmuch as Dr. Siems’ alleged
violation of the Order at the final page of the Settlement Agreement entered into in Case
19-13009-2 makes up the entirety of the basis for Case 23-13009-1. Further, it appears
that the Board may determine to take formal action in both such cases.

‘At commencement of the formal Hearing of this matter, Dr. Siems was again
advised of his right to be represented by counsel, as this Hearing Officer has so advised
him in prior proceedings. The Hearing proceeded with Dr. Siems electing to represent
himself. See Transcript at page 5 (“T.5").

Itis noted very significantly here that the Board has already determined that Dr.
Siems “willfully and knowingly violated his Settlement Agreement” via the Board’s Order
of Suspension And Notice of Hearing filed December 27, 2022. That Order was issued
summarily based on evidence proffered by the IC. A duly noticed formal Order to Show

aL

a

C Cc

Cause hearing to determine whether that summary suspension should continue was heard
before the undersigned on February 2, 2023, with Dr. Siems in attendance, also
representing himself at that time. After that hearing and in light of evidence provided by
the IC and by Dr. Siems, this Hearing Officer confirmed the suspension pending further
decisions by the Board and pending adjudication of the new complaint in Case 23-13009-
1. The April 13 hearing was held to formally adjudicate Case 23-13009-1. At the hearing,
the IC's burden was to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Dr Siems committed
the violation alleged in the Complaint in Case 23-13009-I, i.e. that he knowingly or
willingly failed to comply with the Board’s order confirming his Settlement Agreement.
THE EVIDENCE

‘The evidence adduced at the April 13 hearing is summarized as follows (bold and
italics are inserted by the Hearing Officer):

‘The IC’s Deputy Chief of Investigations and Compliance Officer Johnna LaRue
testified that:

Following the Board's approval of the Settlement Agreement entered into between
Dr. Siems and the IC, Ms. LaRue mailed notice of the Board’s decision to Dr. Siems’ then
‘counsel on December 14, 2021. T.15-17;

Ms. LaRue’s letter, including a copy of the Settlement Agreement, disclosed the
specific requirements with which Dr. Siems would have to comply to meet his obligations
[under the Settlement Agreement, and the fact that he would have one year from the date of
the Board hearing to so comply, which would allow Dr. Siems until December 3, 2022 to
meet all the conditions outlined in the Settlement Agreement, and required by the Board’s
‘Order thereon, T.18-20;

Receipt of Ms. LaRue's letter containing the Settlement Agreement and Board
Order by Dr. Siems’ then counsel’ was confirmed via documentary evidence showing that
it was received on December 18, 2021. T.21-22, 26, IC Exhibit 4;

As noted, Dr. Siems was not represented by counsel at the formal Hearing in Case 19-
13009-2, However, he retained counsel after the Hearing which culminated in execution
of the Settlement Agreement.

un
uM
1s
25.


C Cc

Dr. Siems and his counsel both signed the Settlement Agreement. T.28;

Via a November 18, 2022 email to the IC’s counsel Mr. White, Dr. Siems’ counsel
advised Mr. White that he was no longer representing Dr. Siems. 1.29-30;

Atno time did Dr. Siems’ counsel or any other person ever contact Ms. LaRue or
anyone else at the Board to request an extension of time for Dr. Siems to complete his
requirements under the Settlement Agreement. T.31-33;

Extensions of time to comply with settlement agreement conditions are routinely
given under reasonable circumstances. T.33-34;

Dr. Siems did not complete all his CMEs required by the Settlement Agreement
within the mandated one-year period, nor did he complete the PACE program. .34-35.
Rather, the last required CMEs were completed within a few days following the February
2, 2023 hearing on the license suspension, (which would have been approximately two
months late) . 1.35;

Dr. Siems pressed Ms, LaRue on whether the Board should have required him (Dr.
Siems) to complete the PACE program when he discovered that the program could not
accommodate him. However, Ms. LaRue responded by saying that the Board would have
amended the Settlement Agreement had Dr. Siems contacted the Board within the one-year
period to advise that PACE could not accommodate him. T.38-43;

In response to Dr. Siems raising the issue of possibly not receiving a copy of the
Settlement Agreement from his counsel, Ms. LaRue advised that she had worked a number
of times in the past with the same attorney who represented Dr. Siems, and she has never
had any issues with practitioners not receiving documents from that attomey. 1.45-46;

Had the IC known at any time prior to expiration of his one-year timeline that the
PACE program could not presently accommodate Dr. Siems, arrangements would have
been made to take the matter back to the Board to alter the terms of the Settlement
Agreement. T.47-48;

Dr. Siems recognized a copy of the Settlement Agreement and acknowledged that
he signed it. T.51-52;

a
1s.
rT]
aa

Dr. Siems acknowledged that he knew his deadline for complying with the terms
of the Settlement Agreement was December 3, 2022. T.54;

At some time during December, 2022, Dr. Siems had his manager Isabella call
the IC to provide an update on his process of complying with the Settlement Agreement,
but not to request an extension of time. T.55-56;

Dr. Siems confirmed that while he does not recall receiving the IC’s letter via his
counsel following the approval of the Settlement Agreement, that does not mean that he
does not remember the “settlement demands.” “That’s not my claim. Iwas aware of
what the settlement demands were.” On questioning by Mr. White, Dr. Siems
acknowledged he was aware of the settlement demands as of the date he signed the
document, i.e. November 24, 2021. T.57;

Email correspondence between Dr. Siems and the PACE program showed that Dr.
Siems was not yet enrolled with PACE as of December 20, 2022, as his outstanding
balance due for participation was $10,000.00. ‘The balance due check was dated December
30, 2022, three days after service of the suspension order, T.61, 63-65, Respondent's
Exhibits p.0003, 00095;

The first time that Dr. Siems, or his office personnel, contacted the PACE
program was October 31, 2022 (or approximately 33 days prior to the compliance
deadline in the Settlement Agreement). T.63;

When asked directly if he complied with the terms of the Settlement Agreement,
Dr. Siems answered “No.” 7.65;

Dr. Siems was advised that he had the opportunity to present a defense case, but as
the Board and its IC have the burden of proof, he (Dr. Siems) had no obligation to do so.
‘Dr. Siems chose to provide a defense case. T.67-68;

Beginning at page 75 of the transcript, Dr. Siems provided a quite thorough history
of some highly traumatic personal crises which began happening in is life in November,
2022, ie. approximately one month or less before the December 3, 2022 deadline for
‘complying with the Settlement Agreement, Those circumstances include a November 22,
2022 trip to Burope for approximately two weeks due to family medical emergencies,

longoing emergent care of a young man that Dr. Siems refers to as his step-son upon return
to the United States from Europe, and the necessity of a restraining order on December 23,
2022. The undersigned Hearing Officer declines to include details of those matters here to
protect the privacy of Dr. Siems’ and his family members. Suffice it to say that
circumstances involving the mother of his children, and the young man whom Dr. Siems
refers to as his step-son, were in crisis stage, which, according to sworn testimony, were
physically and emotionally consuming. T.75-141;

Dr. Siems received a letter ftom the PACE program advising that the program
could not accommodate Dr. Siems. That letter was dated April 6, 2023. T.82,
Respondent's Exhibits p.0147;

Dr. Siems believes itis the Board’s responsibility to determine whether or not the
PACE program could accommodate him, Dr. Siems does not feel it is his responsibility to
make that determination. 7.84;

Dr. Siems testified that he waited four months, 1. until the PACE program letter of
April 6, 2023, to discover / confirm that PACE could not accommodate him. 1.89;

Dr. Siems asked his witness Ame! Youssef, 0.D., if the trauma they jointly
experienced because of her son’s medical emergencies could distract a person “enough that
mundane parts of life, perhaps, were ignored and made oblivious?” She testified in the
affirmative. T.114-115;

ANALYSIS

This Hearing Officer did not find any witness who testified at the hearing to have
credibility issues. While the witnesses called by Dr. Siems could be argued to be self-
serving, those witnesses presented as genuine and factual. This Hearing Officer takes their
by the IC, at full face value,

Dr. Siems executed the Settlement Agreement on November 24, 2021. He soon
thereafter learned that pursuant to an Order of the Board, he had until December 3, 2022,

‘testimony, along with all of that eli

to complete the conditions of his resolution. He first contacted the PACE program on
October 31, 2022, one month and three days before his deadline for full completion of all
conditions. That deadline came and went without Dr. Siems handling his CME or PACE.

obligations. On December 27, 2022, Dr. Siems” license was summarily suspended for his
failure to comply with the conditions of the Settlement Agreement. A formal noticed
hearing confirming the suspension was held February 2, 2023. It was after that hearing
that Dr. Siems completed his CME requirements, which was more than two months out of,
compliance. Dr. Siems received a letter confirming that the PACE program could not
accommodate him on or after April 6, 2023, just a week prior to the formal Hearing on the
Complaint alleging his failure to comply. And while Dr. Siems had his office manager
contact the IC with a status update on his compliance at some time in December, 2022,
(most likely after his December 3 deadline), at no time ~ either before or after the deadline
- did Dr. Siems or his staff ever request additional time to complete his requirements under
the Settlement Agreement.

Dr. Siems offered what is genuinely a compassion-evoking explanation of a series
of unfortunate and even tragic events in his life - not the results of his doing - and which no
doubt required a great deal of his time and attention, The evidence ts clear that he

responded well to loved ones in need. His actions were indeed admirable.

Unfortunately, Dr. Siems’ defense is measured against three harsh realities. First,
as he readily acknowledged, Dr. Siems failed to comply with the terms of his Settlement
Agreement and the Board's Order mandating such. Second, Dr. Siems made no contact
with the PACE program till he was only thirty-three days away from his deadline. Third,
Dr. Siems did not reach out to the IC until after his deadline passed, and even when he had
his office manager call, it was to provide a status update and not to seek additional time to
comply. Further, itis apparent from the record that the great majority of the challenges
that occurred in Dr. Siems* personal life arose either just prior to his compliance deadline ~
and some even occurred thereafter (such as the necessity of obtaining a restraining order).
Dr. Siems also offers as part of his defense that it should have been the Board's
responsibility to ensure that the PACE program could accommodate his area of specialty /
‘expertise before including such in the Settlement Agreement. While not fully articulated in
the record, it appears to the Hearing Officer that those involved in crafting the Settlement
‘Agreement had ample cause to believe based on past experience that the PACE program


un

v

could serve a physician of Dr. Siems' specialty. It is also apparent from the record that
Covid-19 had impacted the ability of the PACE program to accommodate some specialties.
‘Accordingly, the Hearing Officer does not recognize a basis to leave upon the Board sole
responsibility for the potential availability of the PACE program to function for Dr. Siems
‘As stated repeatedly by the IC’s counsel Mr. White, had Dr. Siems not waited 333 days to

tiate contact with PACE, this case could have been quite different. Ms. LaRue made
sufficiently clear that timely notice of any deficiency in the ability of the PACE program to
serve in this case would have allowed the Board to amend its requirements. Finally, there
is the logical reality that the party on the hook, ie. the one with his licensure at stake,
‘ought to engage in sufficient due diligence to ensure he is doing all that is required to
preserve his valuable practice. Dr. Siems offered no explanation as to why he did not
reach out to PACE until October 31, 2022, or why he did not complete his CMEs from the
time he signed the Settlement Agreement in November, 2021, until his personal challenges
arose in late November 2022. Finally, it must be recognized that Dr. Siems? counsel - who
‘was an extension of Dr. Siems, participated in the negotiating and crafting of the
Settlement Agreement. And it was Dr. Siems who executed that Agreement, And
accordingly, Dr. Siems shares responsibility for what that Agreement contains.

Itis also significant that the statute at issue here is one of strict liability. While Dr.
Siems argues that the statute does not prohibit consideration of extenuating circumstances,
that does not obviate the plain language of the law that “knowingly or willfully failing to
‘comply with ... [an] order of the Board constitutes grounds for ini

‘ing disciplinary
action. The Settlement Agreement became an Order of the Board when the Board
approved it. The Order is the final page of the Agreement. Dr. Siems candidly admitted
he knew that he did not comply with that Order. The knowing prong of the statute is thus
satisfied. And while not a necessary finding or conclusion since either a knowing or
willful violation wil trigger the ramifications of the statute, it can reasonably be
determined that Dr. Siems” failure to comply was willful considering the long delay before
he took any action whatsoever. The Hearing Officer finds Dr. Siems’ passive description
of the Board’s Order as a “mundane part of life” as a reflection of the amount of concern

an

he had for the Order, which is further reflected in the long delay before any action was
taken whatsoever. In any event, the knowing violation is clear and convincing, thus
exceeding the IC’s burden of proving their case by a preponderance of the evidence.
CONCLUSION

This Hearing Officer, while readily acknowledging the significant trying life events
lexperienced by Dr. Siems and his family, must recommend that the Board find that
Respondent Dr. Jon Lane Siems, M.D., violated the statute as alleged in the Complaint, in
that he knowingly failed to comply with the terms of the Order contained within the
Settlement Agreement. There is no doubt room for compassion for Dr. Siems in all he
‘experienced in his personal life right around the compliance deadline. But those
extenuating circumstances do not negate the knowing failure to meet his mandated
obligations, especially when he took no action to inform the Board of those circumstances
and/or to seek additional time to comply, or to have the requirements duly amended.

Respectfully submitted this 8th day of May, 2023.
