At all times material to this Indictment:

_ —DEPULY
















Case 2:20-cr-00229-CDS-MDC Document 201 Filed 10/25/23 Page 2 of 7

1. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), Title 21, United States Code,
Sections 801, et seq., governs the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled
substances in the United States. With limited exceptions for medical professionals, the
CSA makes it “unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally ... to manufacture,
distribute, or dispense . . . a controlled substance.”

2. The CSA defines a “controlled substance” as a drug or other substance that
is included in one of five schedules—Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V—of Subchapter I, Part B
of the Act. 21 U.S.C. § 802(6). Drugs or substances are placed into these schedules based,
at least in part, on their potential for abuse, likelihood of physical or psychological
dependency, accepted medical use, and accepted safety for use under medical supervision.

a. “Schedule II” indicates that the drug or other substance has a currently
accepted medical use with severe restrictions and has a high potential for abuse that can
lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. 21 U.S.C. § 812(b)(2).

b. “Schedule IV” indicates that the drug or other substance has a currentl
accepted medical use with severe restrictions and has a low potential for abuse that can lead
to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence, relative to the drugs or othe]
substances in Schedule III. 21 U.S.C. § 812(b)(4).

3. Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 1308.12, 1308.13, 1308.14,
and 1308.15 lists the drugs and other substances contained in Schedules II, III, IV, and V,
respectively.

4, Title 21, United States Code, Section 822(b) and Title 21, Code of Federal
Regulations, Section 290.1, provide that the controlled substances listed in Schedules II-V
can be dispensed or distributed only pursuant to a prescription issued by a medical

practitioner registered with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”).






1S










Case 2:20-cr-00229-CDS-MDC Document 201 Filed 10/25/23 Page 3 of 7

The DEA, as authorized by the CSA, issues registration numbers to qualifying medical
practitioners that allow them to issue prescriptions for Schedule II-V controlled substances.
William Alvear, M.D., defendant herein, is a medical practitioner registered with the DEA.

5. Accordingly, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1306.03,
controlled substances, such as opioid pain medications that are Schedule II-V controlled
substances, can be dispensed only pursuant to a valid prescription from a medical
practitioner authorized by the DEA to distribute controlled substances.

6. Under Title 21, United States Code, Section 802(10), the term “dispense”
means to deliver a controlled substance to an ultimate user or research subject by, or
pursuant to the lawful order of, a practitioner, including the prescribing and administering
of a controlled substance and the packaging, labeling, or compounding necessary to
prepare the substance for such delivery. The term “dispenser” means a practitioner who so
delivers a controlled substance to an ultimate user.

7. Under Title 21, United States Code, Section 802(11), the term “distribute”
means to deliver (other than by administering or dispensing) a controlled substance or a
listed chemical. The term “distributor” means a person who so delivers a controlled
substance or a listed chemical.

8. Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 1306.04 provides that in order
for a prescription for a controlled substance to be valid, it “must be issued for a legitimate
medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional
practice.”

9. A prescription for a controlled substance issued without a legitimate medical

purpose or outside of the individual practitioner's usual course of his professional practice


Case 2:20-cr-00229-CDS-MDC Document 201 Filed 10/25/23 Page 4 of 7

is not a valid prescription, and the person who issues the prescription violates Title 21,
United States Code, Section 841(a)(1).
