The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Deonne E, Contine, General Counsel and attomey for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Kenneth W. Adams, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of|
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and
allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 15464). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 30, 2014.

2, Information submitted to the Board by Respondent, and included on the Board’s
website, shows Respondent’s specialty as Emergency Medicine. Plastic and cosmetic surgery are
not specialties of Emergency Medicine.

Premier Liposuction, LLC.

4. At all times relative to this Complaint Respondent was performing liposuction

surgery, an elective cosmetic procedure that is not medically necessary, at Premier Liposuction
Pr iy ry,

fe Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal

while at the same time practicing Emergency Medicine through employment with an emergency
physician practice group.

5. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint certified by the American
Board of Emergency Medicine which is a member Board of the American Board of Medical
Specialties (ABMS). Respondent is not certified by any other ABMS Board.

6. Respondent’s advertisement on an internet search of Google Maps shows Premier
Liposuction under the category of plastic surgeon, despite there being no plastic surgeons working
at Premier Liposuction.

7. Respondent has received training in liposuction surgery only by way of a two (2)
day course in liposuction and fat transfer offered by the International Society of|
Cosmetogynecology (ISCG).

8. Notwithstanding this limited training and his ABMS Board Certification as an
Emergency Physician, Respondent advertises himself as a premier and top-rated liposuction
doctor.

9. Respondent advertises that he “holds certification and membership with the
International Society of Cosmetogynecology and the American College of Emergency Medicine,”
implying the certificate he received after a two-day course is equal to his residency training in
Emergency Medicine.

10. Patient A? was a sixty-six (66) year-old female at the time of the events at issue in
this Complaint.

11. Respondent saw = Patient += A —at_—- Premier —_—_Liposuction on
November 5, 2021, when she had a scheduled appointment for liposuction surgery of her arms,
“bra rolls”, and “hip rolls”.

12. Patient A completed a packet of preprinted forms, by e-signature on October 27,
2021, before her appointment with Respondent.

13. The documents Patient A e-signed included a Pre-op Information form that detailed

the medication she would be taking (Keflex, Xanax, Percocet, and Gabapentin) and preoperative

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

instructions on how she should take the medication. The Pre-op Information directed Patient A to
take the antibiotic Keflex and the pain medication Gabapentin the night before the surgery at
bedtime. However, the Liposuction Procedure Record documents that Patient A received Percocet,
Xanax, and Gabapentin. This conflicts with the Pre-op Information sheet because it does not
document that she was given or had taken an antibiotic preoperatively.

14. Respondent failed to reviewed Patient A’s prescription utilization report to
determine if Patient A had been issued another prescription for a similar controlled substance.
Respondent's records do not contain a copy of a prescription utilization report for Patient A.

15. Records also show that Patient A e-signed or e-initialed additional documents on
October 27, 2021: Anesthesia Consent, Consent to Release Photographs of her on the Internet,
Informed Consent for Controlled Substances, INFORMED CONSENT - LIPOSUCTION
(Suction-Assisted Lipectomy Surgery) (Ultrasound-Assisted Lipectomy Surgery); CONSENT
FOR SURGERY/ PROCEDURE or TREATMENT.

16. Respondent’s preoperative notes, including his OFFICE SURGERY PRE-OP
HISTORY & PHYSICAL EXAM form, do not document that any of the consent forms Patient A
signed on October 27, 2021, were discussed with Patient A.

17. Upon information and belief no explanation was provided to Patient A, nor did any
discussion occur with her regarding any of the forms she e-signed or e-initialed that are dated
October 27, 2021.

18. Respondent’s “OFFICE SURGERY PRE-OP HISTORY & PHYSICAL EXAM”
form notes, of relevance, a lap band surgery, a partial lung removal surgery, and current
medications including metoprolol, but does not document a thorough history and medical
assessment or otherwise contain an evaluation of whether Patient A was an appropriate candidate
for liposuction surgery.

19. Respondent’s “OFFICE SURGERY PRE-OP HISTORY & PHYSICAL EXAM”
form indicates, notwithstanding that no history and medical assessment or evaluation of whether
Patient A was an appropriate candidate for liposuction surgery was documented, that no medical

clearance was needed because Patient A had a previous liposuction surgery that she tolerated well.

20. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not conduct a thorough history and
medical assessment or otherwise evaluate whether Patient A was an appropriate candidate for
liposuction surgery.

21. Respondent’s “OFFICE SURGERY PRE-OP HISTORY & PHYSICAL EXAM”
form appears to be dated October 27, 2021. However, the weight and pre op exam vitals
documented (189.8 Ibs., 190/113 BP, 97.8 Temp, and 108 HR) are the same as the weight and
vitals documented on the Liposuction Procedure Record dated November 5, 2021.

22. What appears to be a preprinted Operative Note from Respondent's records is a
template form not individualized for Patient A.

23. The Operative Note from Respondent’s records does not identify a surgical
assistant. Accordingly, it appears that Respondent acted as both surgeon and anesthesiologist
during Patient A’s surgery.

24. Respondent’s medical records lack clear documentation of any preoperative
appointments or consultations with Patient A.

25. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not have any preoperative
appointments or consultations with Patient A.

26. — Respondent’s medical records lack any documentation of any preoperative lab
work ordered for Patient A.

27. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not order any preoperative lab work
for Patient A.

28. Respondent does not document any post operative care he provided to Patient A.

29. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not provide any post operative care to
Patient A.

30. Patient A was admitted to Sunrise Hospital on November 7, 2021, and ultimately
diagnosed with cerebral infarction, pulmonary emboli, and atrial septal defect.

31. Respondent's Patient Follow-up form dated November 10, 2021, indicates Patient
A had bruising to her bilateral upper extremity. The Visit Notes indicate that Patient A was

39. Respondent failed to maintain accurate medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment, and care of Patient A, by using templated forms that fail to properly document his
actions, care, and assessment. Respondent’s notes lack specific details of the case, Patient A’s
medical history and his physical assessment when he treated Patient A, whose medical records
were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

40. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IIT
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(3) - Violation of Statutes and Regulations of the
Nevada State Board of Pharmacy

41. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference
as though fully set forth herein.

42. Respondent is a practitioner as defined by NRS 639.0125(1), as a physician, who
holds a license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada.

43. NRS 630.306(1)(b)(3) provides that engaging in conduct that violates a provision
of chapter 639 of NRS, or a regulation adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy pursuant thereto,
that is applicable to a licensee who is a practitioner, as defined in NRS 639.0125, is grounds for
initiating discipline against a licensee.

44. — Pursuant to NRS 639.23507(1) a practitioner “shall, before issuing an initial
prescription for a controlled substance listed in schedule II, III or IV or an opioid that is a
controlled substance listed in schedule V . . . obtain a patient utilization report regarding the
patient from the computerized program established by the [Nevada Pharmacy] Board and the
Investigation Division of the Department of Public Safety pursuant to NRS 453.162. The

practitioner shall:

(a) Review the patient utilization report; and

(b) Determine whether the patient has been issued another
prescription for the same controlled substance that provides for
ongoing treatment using the controlled substance. If the
practitioner determines from the patient utilization report or from
any other source that the patient has been issued such a

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL

prescription, the practitioner shall not prescribe the controlled
substance unless the practitioner determines that issuing the
prescription is medically necessary. . ..”

45. Respondent failed to obtain and review the patient utilization record, as required by
NRS 639.23507, which is a violation of a provision of chapter 639 of NRS.

46. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IV
NRS 630.306(1)(e) - Practice Beyond Scope of License

47. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

48. — NRS 630.306(1)(e) provides that practicing or offering to practice beyond the
scope permitted by law or performing services which the licensee knows or has reason to know
that he or she is not competent to perform, or which are beyond the scope of his or her training
constitutes grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

49. As demonstrated by, but not limited to the above-outlined facts, Respondent is
board-certified in Emergency Medicine. Respondent is not a board-certified plastic surgeon and has
only received instruction in cosmetic surgery from workshops and therefore lacks the requisite and
proper training in plastic and cosmetic surgery to perform liposuction surgery.

$0. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT V
NRS 630.304(2) — False Advertising

51. Alll of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

53. NAC 630.190(1)(c) provides that a licensee shall not advertise in such a manner
that the advertising claims or implies professional superiority of the performance of any
professional service in a manner superior to other practitioners.

54. As demonstrated by, but not limited to the above-outlined facts, Respondent calls
his practice Premier Liposuction and advertises himself on his website as a top-rated liposuction
doctor implying that his performance of liposuction services is superior to other practitioners.

55. NAC 630.190(1)(e) provides that a licensee shall not advertise in such a manner
that the advertising includes any statement which is known to be false, or through the exercise of |
reasonable care should be known to be false, deceptive, misleading or harmful, in order to induce
any person to purchase, utilize or acquire any professional services or to enter into any obligation
or transaction relating thereto.

56. NAC 630.190(1)(g) provides that a licensee shall not advertise in such a manner
that the advertising is false, deceptive or misleading in regard to services performed or to be
performed.

57. Respondent advertises that he “holds certification and membership with the
International Society of Cosmetogynecology and the American College of Emergency Medicine,”
attempting to mislead or deceive the public into believing that the certificate he received after a
two (2) day workshop is equal to his residency training and ABMS certification in Emergency
Medicine to inflate his credentials in performing liposuction surgery and induce patients to seek
his services.

58. Respondent’s advertisement on a Google Maps internet search shows Premier
Liposuction under the category of plastic surgeon is false and misleading because he is not a
plastic surgeon, and no plastic surgeons work at Premier Liposuction.

59. Respondent's indication in his advertisement on his website that he is ABMS

certified in Emergency M ine is inconsistent with both the name Premier Liposuction and the
services he provides and misleads the public that his certification in Emergency Medicine
provides the necessary training to perform liposuction surgery to inflate his credentials and induce

patients to seek his services.

60. NAC 630.190(2) states that it is sufficient for disciplinary purposes that any
statement or other advertising described in paragraph (¢), (f) or (g) of subsection I has a tendency

to: (a) Deceive, mislead or harm the public because of its false, deceptive, misleading or harmful

character; or (b) Produce unrealistic expectations in particular cases, even though no member of
the public is actually deceived, misled or harmed, or no unrealistic expectations are actually
produced by the statement or other advertising.

provided in NRS 630.352.
