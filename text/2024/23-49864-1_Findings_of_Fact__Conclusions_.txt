FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATION’

1. Introduction

‘This matter was heard on January 18, 2024, by fully remote means given Respondent is
currently residing out of the country. Participating in the hearing were undersigned; lan Cumings
on behalf of the Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (the
IC”); Respondent Nabil Elkhoury, M.D. (“Respondent”); Respondent's counsel Christian
Balducci, Esq.; IC witness Timothy MeFarren, M.D., M.S. F.A.C.0.G. (also referred to as the
“1C’s expert"); and Respondent witness Robert Atlas, M.D. (also referred to as “Respondent's
expert”) All witnesses were sworn. The rule of exclusion was not invoked by either party.

2. Allegations

‘The Complaint alleges Count I, NRS 630.301(4), Malpractice, and Count II, NRS
630,3062(1)(a), Failure to Maintain Proper Medical Records. See Complaint, filed on June 27,
2023. The Complaint centers upon whether Respondent committed malpractice by failing to
deliver dichorionic diamniotic twins within the delivery window recommended by Manijeh
Kaymar, M.D., Maternal-Fetal Medicine Subspecialist (also referred to as the “MFM"), and for
failing to document why he deviated from the MFM’s recommendation. It is alleged that
Respondent scheduled the delivery outside of the MFM’s recommended delivery window by two

days, within which Twin A suffered intrauterine fetal demise attributed to placenta abruption.
‘Twin B survived and was successfully delivered.

3. Case Summary

Inrelation to the IC’s case, undersigned heard from expert witness Timothy C, McFarren,
M.D., M.S. F.A.C.0.G. who testified to his experience, explained the background necessary to
understand the allegations, and opined that Respondent committed malpractice by failing to
deliver the twins within the delivery window recommended by the MFM. Dr. McFarren further
opined that Respondent failed to maintain proper medical records by failing to record his
reasoning for deviating from the recommended delivery window. TR 11-86,

In relation to Respondent's case, undersigned heard from Respondent who testified that he
spoke with the MFM about the delivery date Respondent scheduled, which was past the MFM’s
recommended delivery window, and that he and the MFM werc in agreement as to the extended
date based upon reassuring testing. TR 88-107; 157-160. Respondent's expert witness Robert
Atlas, M.D. who is a Maternal-Fetal Medicine Specialist, testified that Respondent acted
‘appropriately by scheduling the delivery date within the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists (“ACOG”) guidelines for “Dichorionic-diamniotic twins with isolated grown
restriction,” which provides for delivery at “36 0/7 - and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation” ~ the MFM
having recommended a delivery window of “37-0/7 to 37 3/7 weeks due to twin gestation with
isolated growth restriction.” TR 109 -155.

4. Witnesses and Testimony

‘The IC and its expert Dr. McFarten premised an allegation of malpractice on the
‘undisputed facts that the patient had active problems that were noted to be Hepatitis, C Vit
\Chronic; Maternal Mental Disorder Complicating Pregnancy Childbirth and Puerperium; Mutual
Gestation; personal history of other mental and behavioral disorders; history of pregnancy
‘complications; urinary tract infection; previous sexually-transmitted disease; history of drug
abuse; and smoking, which rendored the pregnancy high risk beyond it just being a twin
pregnancy, which alone is considered high risk. IC Exhibit 5, pp. 164-166; 109 — 127; TR 22-23.

‘As a result of the high risk pregnancy posed by the patient’s conditions, the patient was
referred to a Maternal-Fetal Medicine Specialist and, after having seen a specialist provider at a
different office (IC Exhibit 5, p. 274), in May of 2020 consulted with Dr. Kaymar's office, which,
|commencing in July of 2020, recommended and undertook twice weekly antenatal testing that
|was to take place until delivery. IC Exhibit 5, p. 256. As a result of testing, it was communicated
{to Respondent, by correspondence dated July 20, 2020, and signed by Dr. Kamyer, that Twin A
deménstrated fetal growth restriction, IC Exhibit 6, p. 355, TR 24-25. A finding of
polyhydramnios was also brought to Respondent's attention, Jd, As a result, the MFM
recommended delivery “between 37 0/7 ~ 37 3/7 weeks, which remained the recommendation
throughout the MFM’s records up to August 11, 2020. IC Exhibit 5, pp. 213-216, The
recommendation rendered a delivery window of August 12, 2020, through August 15, 2020.

On July 28, 2020, eight days after the MFM’s initial designation of the delivery window,
the patient saw Respondent who noted in his medical records the finding of polyhydramnios for
both twins and wrote that he was going to induce labor at 38 weeks, which was past the MFM's
recommended delivery window. IC Exhibit 5, pp. 117 of 116-118; TR 30-31. Thereafter, on
|August 5, 2020, two days after having again met with the MFM, the patient met with Respondent
]who then scheduled delivery for August 19, 2020, which would have been 37-5/7 weeks - two
days past the window recommended by the MFM only days prior. IC Exhibit 5, pp. 113-115; IC
Exhibit 6, p. 371; TR 33-35; 38-39, .

In records dated August 12, 2020, Respondent notes that he discussed the ultrasound
report with the patient at length but does not acknowledge the MFM recommerided delivery
|window nor any reason for deviting from the MFM’s recommendation, IC Exhibit 5, pp. 110-
112,

On August 16, 2020, the day after the delivery window recommended by the MFM, the
patient presented to an emergency room with bleeding. IC Exhibit 7. It was determined at that
time that Twin A suffered intrauterine fetal demise. Jd. Twin B survived and was delivered. Id.

Based upon the foregoing, the IC’s expert Dr. MoFadden opined that Respondent
‘committed malpractice by not adhering to the recommended delivery window of the MFM, which

weer aneon

u
a
n



‘was consistent with the ACOG guidelines for “Dichorionic-diamniotic twins with concurrent
condition,” which provides for an “[i}ndividualized” determination for delivery, which was
undertaken by the MFM and discounted by Respondent. TR 44-46; 82-83. The IC’s expert
further opined that the records were incomplete given that no reason for the deviation from the
MFM's recommendation was provided. TR 32-33; 36-37; 78.

Respondent's retort was two-fold, that being: 1) that the ACOG guidelines for
“Dichorionic-diamniotic twins with isolated grown restriction,” which provides for delivery at “36
O/T - and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation” was the applicable guideline and was adhered to; and 2) that
the MFM agreed with the extended delivery date as evidenced by the notation on the MFM's
‘August 13, 2020 records under “GENERAL COMMENT” that “{tJbe patient is scheduled for
delivery on 8/17/2020,” and as testified to by Respondent.

‘The MFM recommended delivery window was consistently 37 0/7 to 37 3/7, which
rendered an outside delivery date of August 15, 2020. To the extent Respondent claims the MFM
modified this recommendation, the same is not supported by the record in that the record relied
upon by Respondent, that being IC Exhibit 5, p. 208, only serves to note the scheduled delivery
date by providing “t]he patient is scheduled for delivery on 8/17/2020,” and does not make a
modified recommendation,

‘Notably, the MFM was consistently clear in all of his recommendations for a delivery
window, providing language of “[rJecommended delivery between 37-0/7 and 37-3/7 weeks due
to twin gestational with isolated growth restriction,” See, ¢.g., IC Exhibit 5, p. 216. No such
language followed the MFM's August 11, 2020, report that would have arguably modified the
recommended delivery window.

While the notation by the MFM of “L & D As indicated” under “RECOMMENDATION”
on IC Exhibit 5, p. 208, dated August 13, 2020, is arguably ambiguous in that it is not clear
‘whether itis a reference to what the MFM hed previously indicated as the recommended delivery
|window or whether itis a reference to the delivery date scheduled by Respondent noted below on
the same document (assuming L & D means labor and delivery, which was never testified to nor

we erwraneon

rt
iS
ot

a


argued by Responden), the ambiguity is clarified not only given the consistent recommendation
language utilized by the MFM but more so by and through the allegation response letter to the IC
dated November 1, 2021, whereby Respondent addressed the recommended delivery window and
concedes that “[o]n August 13, 2020, [the patient] was seen by Dr. Kamyar. It was noted the
gestational age was 37 weeks and still recommended delivery between 37-0/3 to 37-3/7 due to
twin gestation with isolated growth restrictions, Dr. Kamyar noted [the patient] was scheduled for
delivery on August 17, 2020.” IC Exhibit 2, p. 8. Thus, by Respondent's own prior admission, he
had understood the MFM’s recommended delivery window as of August 13, 2020, to be 37 0/7 to
37 3/7, and he nonetheless scheduled delivery past that window, after which, Twin A passed in
jutero,

It is also telling that in the same response letter, when accused of ignoring the MFM’s
recommended delivery window, Respondent does not suggest that he spoke with the MFM and
that the MFM modified his recommendation to support the date scheduled by Respondent.

Rather, Respondent maintains that the delivery date he scheduled past the MFM’s recommended
‘window for delivery was consistent with the ACOG (snd Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine)
guidelines? IC Exhibit 2, p. 9, Had Respondent spoken to the MFM and the MFM agreed to
modify his recommendation, surely Respondent would have raised that in response to the
allegation letter. There was also no testimony from the MFM himself to indicate that took place,
nor any records evidencing such a conversation,

In response to the allegation letter Respondent also makes misstatements such as Twin A’s
passing on August 16, 2020, a day past the MFM’s recommended delivery window and a day
prior to the scheduled delivery, was within the MFM's recommended delivery window, which it
]was not given the outset of the MFM's recommended delivery window was August 15,2020. In
farther response to the allegation letter, Respondent claims that he adhered to the MFM's delivery
recommendation window, which by his own statement as to the delivery window having been
from 37-0/7 to 37-3/7 and him scheduling delivery for 37-5/7, is not the case. IC Exhibit 2, pp. 8-
9; IC Bxhibit 5, p. 113 (whereby Respondent scheduled a C-Section delivery for August 17,

2 The SMFM Guidelines were never submitted nor addressed.

wear aneaan

i

a


2020).

Respondent never addressed the polyhydramnios and his expert downplayed it with no
substantive response relating thereto, TR 120. Respondent's expert also downplayed Twin A's
growth restriction (TR 123) and skirted addressing the meaning of “concurrent condition” as used
in the ACOG guidelines, ultimately conceding it “would seem to be other factors that may be
involved in this case,” TR 136-137.

Here, the patient posed numerous risk factors that, even if discounted as relevant to a
maternal condition and not a fetal condition, it remained that there was a noted concer of
polyhydramnios relevant to both fetuses, which supports consideration of a concurrent condition
to the growth restriction as relevant to the ACOG guidelines, and undersigned finds the IC's
expert's presentation as to that issue substantially more credible (particularly as Respondent, and
his expert to a lesser extent, emphasized individual care but then discounted the concept in
application to this particular patient). TR 44-46; 82-83; 101-102; 147; 158. With thet, the
applicable ACOG guideline would have been “[dJichorionic-diamniotic twins with concurrent
condition” and the delivery guideline was properly “[iJndividualized,” which is what was
undertaken by the MFM. Even if that was not the case, Respondent provided no basis in his
records nor his testimony to deviate from the MFM’s recommendation, Rather, Respondent
purported to rely upon the blophysical profiles being normal (TR 124) but that testing was also
known by the MFM who took them into consideration when making the delivery date window
recommendation and, as testified to by the IC’s expert, normal biophysical profiles do not
eliminate the risk factors that were present. TR 75-77.

Ona final note, Respondent's expert repeatedly stated that he did not know how the MFM.
deduced such a narrow delivery window (IR 117, 126, 146), and characterized the demise of
‘Twin A having taken place past the MFM’s recommended delivery window as a “coincidence”
(TR 129), and stated that the MFM “got lucky” (TR 155). Yet, the whole point of consulting with
an MFM is to take as much guess work out of choosing a safe delivery date as possible and, in
this case, the MFM was spot on. Respondent's expert’s inability to deduce the MFM's
preciseness does not excuse Respondent's failure to abide by the MFM's recommendation for no

we maranenan

iW
a

B


appropriate reason.

Based upon the foregoing, in addition to Respondent's failure t6 address his deviation
from the MFM’s delivery window recommendation in support of the delivery date he scheduled in
his records otherwise and/or to note any conversations he deemed relevant with the MFM, I
recommend that Respondent be found to have committed both malpractice and to have failed to
maintain proper medical records.

While the situation was unfortunate and Ihave no doubt that Respondent regrets the
outcome, I find Respondent's response to the allegations to Jack credibility and deem it an attempt
to shield himself from the consequences of his regrettable decision to discount the MFM's
recommended delivery window. I defer to the Board with respect to any disciplinary action it
may deem appropriate should the Board agree with and adopt these findings and recommendation.
