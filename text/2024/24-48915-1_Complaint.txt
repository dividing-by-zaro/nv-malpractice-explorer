COMPLAINT
‘The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners|

(Board), by and through Donald K. White, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Daniel Gene Libke, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

L Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 18072). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 10, 2018.

2. Patient A? was a thirty (30) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. On June 9, 2019 Patient A presented to a freestanding emergency facility at Green
Valley Ranch complaining of sudden leg pain with swelling and had a history of osteomyelitis.
Respondent evaluated Patient A and noted he had tachycardia, was in severe pain, had
hyperesthesia and marked swelling in his lower leg.

vi

* The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Aury Nagy, M.D., Nick M. Spittos, M.D., and
Ms. Maggie Arias-Petrel,

7 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint

4. Patient A was given a series of diagnostic films and tests performed to rule out
deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

5. Respondent ordered laboratory testing on Patient A’s, which revealed a severe
anion gap acidosis, elevated blood glucose, low sodium, low potassium, low chloride, and low
bicarbonate. Patient A’s kidney function was normal.

6. Respondent ordered Patient A to have a serum lactic acid level test but did not
order a serum beta-hydroxybutyrate test, which may have revealed the possibility Patient A was
experiencing sepsis and diabetic ketoacidosis, respectively.

7. Patient A’s blood test results revealed an imbalance of electrolytes, which
Respondent believed to be caused by Patient A’s bout of recent vomiting and diarrhea. However,
Patient A’s vomiting and diarrhea had resolved itself three (3) days before Patient A’s visit to the
emergency facility.

8. Respondent only considered plain radiographs to rule out acute osteomyelitis
and/or a deep lower leg soft tissue infection, which are not adequate tests.

9. Respondent's records for Patient A lacked documentation of family history and
review of systems and failed to document whether or not Respondent had verified pulses distal to

the area of concer, i.e., dorsalis pedis and posterior ti

arteries, to rule out the possibility of an
ischemic limb.

10. Patient A was discharged on July 3, 2019, with orders to follow up with an
orthopedic surgeon, an infectious disease specialist, an endocrinologist, and a primary care
physician.

13. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances,”

14. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
Respondent failed to properly analyze the results of the blood tests ordered on Patient A,
specifically the elevated blood glucose and low potassium levels, as well as not ordering
additional necessary blood tests, such as a serum beta-hydroxybutyrate test, which may have
revealed the possibility the Patient A was experiencing sepsis and diabetic ketoacidosis.
Respondent failed to consider alternative diagnoses, such as Diabetes Mellitus or Diabetic Kidney
Acidosis when treating Patient A.

15. Respondent also failed to adequately diagnose or rule out acute osteomyelitis
and/or a deep lower leg soft tissue infection, and in doing so, failed to admit or transfer Patient A
to a facility capable of completing the necessary testing, including obtaining an MRI or tagged
WBC study.

16. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

condition. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care provider to address the

doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition and such a timely consultation
would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and may have enhanced the quality of medical
care provided to Patient A with regard to his unusual laboratory blood results while at the
emergency facility. Respondent also failed to consult with an orthopedic surgeon to discuss the
findings and any possible need for further imaging and evaluation of acute osteomyelitis.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IIT

23. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

24. — Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records related to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to properly document his actions when the medical
records lacked documentation of family history and review of systems and failed to document
whether or not Respondent had verified pulses distal to the area of concern, i.e., dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial arteries, to rule out the possibility of an ischemic limb.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
