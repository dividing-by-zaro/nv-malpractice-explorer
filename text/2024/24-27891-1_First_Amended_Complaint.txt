pass the PROBE Ethics & Boundaries Course offered by CPEP on or before March 15, 2024?

matter (on May 2, 2023, May 3, 2023, June 1, 2023, and June 2, 2023) and just over nine (9)
months prior to the Board's consideration of this matter at the Board’s September 15, 2023, Board
meeting, after which the Board’s Order dated October 2, 2023, was entered. As such,
Dr. Chambers did not complete the Professional Boundaries Program through PACE as ordered
by the Board in this matter. Any program that was completed on or about December 12, 2022,
would have been completed without the PACE Program having and utilizing the Board’s FECLO
in order to ensure that the Board’s findings were addressed in the program.

10. Dr. Chambers’s Petition was added to the Board’s meeting agenda on June 7, 2024,
and notice was sent to Dr. Chambers and his counsel on May 6, 2024, via email and certified mail

Neither attended the meeting on June 7, 2024, in order to address the Board regarding

Dr. Chambers’s Petition?

11. Further, the timeframe that Dr. Chambers was requesting would end in just eight
(8) days after the Board meeting.

12, On June 15, 2024, and to date, Board staff has received no payments, nor has
Board staff received proof of completion of any of the terms ordered by the Board in the FFCLO
dated October 2, 2023.

> On March 18, 2024, the Board's Deputy Executive Director, Sarah A. Bradley, emailed Dr Chambers's
counsel, Liborious Agwara, Esq., and indicated that the Petition had been received. Ms. Bradley further indicated that
the Board just had a meeting on March 1, 2024, with the next meeting scheduled for June 7, 2024, only the Board 1s
able to modify Board orders, and Dr Chambers was currently not in comphance with the Board's Order as of
March 15, 2024. She further stated that she would discuss with the Executive Director and get back to Mr. Agwara
on the issue Subsequently, on April 5, 2024, as a courtesy, the Board's Executive Director instructed Ms. Bradley to
inform Dr. Chambers's counsel that he would delay enforcement of the Board's Order until May 15, 2024, with the
hope that would allow Dr. Chambers sufficient time to complete the requirements ordered by the Board On
April 5, 2024, the Deputy Executive Director relayed that message to Dr. Chambers’s counsel, Mr. Agwara, by email
and Mr Agwara responded later that day saying, “thanks much for your understanding.” On May 6, 2024, the
Board's Executive Director placed Dr. Chambers’s Petition to Extend Certain Deadlines on the Board's June 7, 2024,
meeting agenda out of an abundance of caution, given that Board staff had not received any information from
Dr. Chambers regarding his compliance with the Board's Order. This way, the Board could review and decide
Dr. Chambers’s request at the June Board meeting. Both Dr. Chambers and Mr. Agwara received notice of the
Peution being placed on the Board's June meeting agenda on May 6, 2024, via email and certified mail. By
May 15, 2024, the Board had received no further information from Dr. Chambers on this issue, nor had Board staff}
received any proof of compliance with the requirements ordered by the Board from Dr. Chambers. To date,
Dr Chambers remains out of compliance with the Board's Order and has engaged in no further communication with
Board staff on this issue.
