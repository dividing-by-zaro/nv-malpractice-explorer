4. On February 24, 2017, and March 6, 2017, Patient A called Respondent, with the
same complaints and with minimal improvement with utilization of the antibiotic. On these two
dates, Respondent provided prescription refills for the same antibiotic.

5. On March 9, 2017, Patient A presented to Respondent with the same or similar
symptoms and complaints. Respondent noted that Patient A’s symptoms had been ongoing for
two (2) months and that he had been through two (2) full courses of antibiotics and cough syrup
without improvement of symptoms. Respondent diagnosed Patient A with acute bronchitis, and
prescribed a new antibiotic, to be taken once daily for ten (10) days.

6. On March 21, 2017, Patient A again presented to Respondent with the same or
similar symptoms and complaints. Respondent noted that Patient A had been through three (3)
full courses of antibiotics, and that his symptoms had returned on March 20, 2017. Respondent
diagnosed Patient A with acute sinusitis and bronchitis, and again prescribed an antibiotic, at a
lower dosage, to be taken daily for ten (10) days. Respondent also ordered a chest x-ray, which
was returned with an impression of “no acute disease.”

7. Respondent’s notes and records from on or about March 21, 2017, do not indicate
that Respondent ordered or recommended laboratory testing to further evaluate Patient A’s
condition, and do not indicate that Respondent provide a referral to an appropriate specialist,
given Patient A’s uncertain diagnosis and lack of clinical improvement.

8. Respondent’s complaints and symptoms persisted after the March 21, 2017,
appointment. Respondent's supervising physician assumed care of Patient A’s treatment after this
appointment date.

% Between February 10, 2017, and March 21, 2017, Respondent repeatedly
prescribed antibiotics to Patient A, without an improvement in Patient A’s condition, and without
clearly defining the diagnosis or confirming the indication for the antibiotics as treatment for his
condition.

10, Patient A eventually presented for emergency care on or about June 25, 2017, was
subsequently evaluated at a hospital, including an infectious disease consultation, and was

diagnosed with endocarditis (inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves).
