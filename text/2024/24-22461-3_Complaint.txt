3. On January 20, 2014, Respondent saw Patient A for a psychiatric evaluation and

previously stated in this footnote, the first record received by the Board investigator from Respondent regarding his
care of Patient A is dated January 20, 2014

5 Upon information and belief, it appears that Patient A saw another provider at Grand Desert Medical during
the years and months when she did not see Respondent for psychiatric care because Respondent provided only the
records for visits with Patient A for the dates listed in this Complaint. This statement is supported by a review of|
Patient A's Patient Report in the PMP which shows that, while Respondent provided multiple prescriptions to
Patient A for controlled substances during the time period at issue in this Complaint, he was not the only prescriber of
these medications for her.

27. Romantic or sexual interactions between physicians and patients that occur
concurrently with the patient-physician relationship detract from the goals of the patient-physician
relationship.

28. Romantic or sexual interactions between physicians and patients that occur

concurrently with the patient-physician relationship may exploit the vulnerability of the patient,

compromise the physician’s ability to make objective judgements and decisions about the
patient’s health care, and ultimately may be detrimental to the patient’s well-being.

29. It is a violation of the standard of care for a physician to prescribe medications to a
patient that he or she has a romantic and/or sexual relationship with.

30. According to Patient A’s Patient Report from the Nevada State Board of
Pharmacy’s Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP), Respondent provided nine (9) prescriptions
for controlled substances to Patient A from March 2, 2019, through March 2, 2022.6

31. Specifically, Respondent provided the following prescrip

sto Patient A during

this time period:

© Respondent may have prescribed medications to Patient A prior to 2019 in conjunction with her
appointments in 2014, 2015, and 2018, but the Board investigator's access to PMP records is limited to the preceding
three (3) years. The Board investigator's query of Patient A’s Patient Report from the PMP for this investigation was
from March 2, 2019 to March 2, 2022.

32. Respondent’s prescribing of controlled substances for Patient A, as listed above,
overlapped with Respondent and Patient A’s personal relationship that was romantic and/or sexual
in nature.

33. Patient A’s prescription for Zolpidem Tartrate (Ambien) 10 mg Tablets,
30 quantity, for 30 days, was written on April 10, 2020, and there is not sufficient justification for
this prescription in her medical records for her telemedicine appointment with Respondent on this
day.

34. Under “Assessment,” her medical records indicate “[i]nsomnia, unspecified
47.00.”

35. However, there is nothing listed in the “Chief Complaint” section or other portion
of Patient A’s medical records for April 10, 2020, that indicates that Patient A was experiencing a
symptom that warranted her need to receive a prescription for a controlled substance to help with
sleep.

36. Respondent also does not make any note in Patient A’s medical records regarding
his decision to prescribe Ambien to Patient A on April 10, 2020.

37. _ A review of Patient A’s medical records maintained by Respondent show other
concerns with regard to the completeness and accuracy of those records, including but not limited
to the following:

A In a progress note dated January 29, 2014, Patient A’s medical records
outlined symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and states in the “Chief|
Complaint” section that Patient A often loses “pencils, toys, assignments,” and that her “grades

B. Upon information and belief, this error is due to Respondent using a
template for symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a child/adolescent.

Cc Similarly, on that same day, January 29, 2014, Respondent assesses
Patient A with, “Attention Deficit Disorder of Childhood Without Hyperactivity 314.00.”

D. This is inaccurate given that Patient A was a 28-year old female on that day.

E. These same errors are included in Patient A’s medical records for an
appointment with Respondent on March 16, 2021, in the “Chief Complaint” section.”

F. Upon information and belief, these errors are included due to Respondent’s
use of a template and his failure to review that template to ensure that only accurate information
about Patient A’s medical condition and symptoms are included in her medical records.

G. Use of templates is not helpful if Patient A’s medical records are not
updated with interim information that accurately reflect Patient A’s symptoms, diagnoses, and
treatment plan.

38. According to Patient A’s Patient History Report in the PMP, Respondent only
queried Patient A’s prescription history twice. Both queries regarding Patient A occurred on the
same day, March 18, 2022,

39. Respondent was prescribing dextroamphetamine-amphetamine (Adderall) to
Patient A in daily quantities of 60 mg to 90 mg per day during the time period at issue in this
complaint.

40. The Federal Drug Administration has found that only in rare cases is it necessary to
prescribe more than 40 mg per day to a patient.

41. Respondent does not address this issue and/or his decision to prescribe Adderall to

Patient A at these higher levels in her medical records.

7 These same errors are not seen in Patient A’s medical records for other visits with Respondent in 2014,
2015, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Upon information and belief, these errors highlight a copy and paste error and/or an
over-reliance on templates in Patient A’s medical records.
