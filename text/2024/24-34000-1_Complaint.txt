The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating
the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1, Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 12812). Respondent was

inally licensed by the Board on July 11, 2008.

2. Patient A? was a forty-two (42) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On January 18, 2019, Patient A presented to the emergency room with tachycardia
and painful urination. Patient A’s clinical presentation was further complicated because she was
pregnant during the events in question.

cea).



4. A urinary analysis of Patient A performed in the emergency room demonstrated a
high white blood cell count present in Patient A’s urine. A limited ultrasound was then obtained
which was interpreted by Respondent.

5. CT imaging and notes from a radiology technician demonstrated an echogenic
kidney with dilation and perinephric fluid (fluid collected around the kidney), shadowing a kidney
stone inferior to the pelvis.

6. Respondent’s interpretation of Patient A’s CT diagnosed Patient A with mild right
hydronephrosis with no biliary dilation or gallstones and a 2cm parapelvic cyst.

7. Respondent failed to diagnose or document the existence of a 1.11cm kidney stone
contiguous with the pelvis, causing kidney obstruction and pyelonephritis (infection of the
kidney).

8. The delay in diagnosing Patient A’s kidney obstruction ultimately led to Patient A
developing rapid onset sepsis resulting in the loss of her pregnancy and the amputation of all ten
(10) toes.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

9. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

10. NRS 630,301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

11. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

12. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, by failing to correctly interpret Patient A’s CT and not
discovering or documenting the existence of a 1.11cm kidney stone causing kidney obstruction.
