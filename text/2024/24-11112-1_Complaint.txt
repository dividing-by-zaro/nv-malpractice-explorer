MEDIGAL EXAMINE!

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Alexander J. Hinman, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Gary Royce Wisner, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 7759). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on March 2, 1996, specializing in orthopedic surgery.

2. Respondent was authorized to practice medicine in the State of California (License
No. A 41236.), until Respondent had to surrender his California license in 2023. Respondent was
originally licensed by the Medical Board of California on October 1, 1984.

3. Respondent was also authorized to practice medicine in the State of Alabama
(License No. MD.19841); however, his Alabama license was revoked, with the revocation
suspended and his license was placed on probation. Respondent was originally licensed by the

Alabama Board on April 29, 1996.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Col. Eric D. Wade,
USAF (Ret.), and Carl N. Williams, Jr., M.D., FACS.

4. On October 20, 2022, the Medical Board of California suspended Respondent’s
license on account of Respondent being convicted of crimes in the Sacramento County Superior
Court. On January 20, 2023, Respondent surrendered his California license.

5. Further, Respondent had to surrender his license to practice medicine in New York
State on March 16, 2023, in Texas on March 8, 2023, in Alabama on January 30, 2023, and in
California on January 20, 2023.

6. On or about December 27, 2022, the Medical Board of California entered into a
Stipulated Surrender of License and Disciplinary Order with Respondent, requiring Respondent to
surrender his medical license and pay twenty-eight thousand six hundred ninety-six dollars and
twenty-five cents ($28,696.25) in agency costs prior to issuance of a new or reinstated license.
The surrender became effective on or about January 30, 2023. See Exhibit 1.

7. The underlying basis for the discipline by the Medical Board of California was that
Respondent had previously been charged with committing acts of gross negligence against eight
(8) patients, failing to keep adequate medical records, and unprofessional conduct. Under the
terms of the agreement, Respondent’s surrender of his medical license is considered a disciplinary
action by the Medical Board of California.

8. On or about November 22, 2023, Respondent entered into a Joint Settlement
Agreement with the Alabama State Board of Medical Examiners, where (1) Respondent consented
to the entry of an order by the (Alabama) Commission reprimanding his medical license and
assessing an administrative fine in the amount of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) (2)
Respondent further consented to the entry of an Order by the Commission revoking his medical
license, suspending said revocation, and placing his license on probation for a term of twenty-four
(24) months, conditioned as follows: that Respondent shall comply with all provisions of the
Consent Decree entered by the Medical Licensure Commission; that Respondent shall comply
with all applicable provisions of federal and state law; and that Respondent shall not engage in
solo medical practice or in any practice in which he has responsibility for medical billing, (3)

Respondent shall abide by all state and federal laws and state and federal regulations related to the

practice of medicine, (4) Respondent shall complete the Intensive Course in Medical Ethics,
Boundaries, and Professionalism presented by Case Western Reserve University School of
Medicine within 180 day[s] of the Commission’s order, (5) Respondent acknowledged and
understood that the Commission shall retain jurisdiction in this matter to enter any such orders as
may be necessary to implement or enforce this Agreement or its own orders, and (6) Respondent
understood that the Board will monitor his compliance with this Agreement. See Exhibit 2.
COUNTI
NRS 630.301(3) - Disciplinary Action by Another State Medical Board

9. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

limitation, the revocation, suspension, modification or limitation of a license to practice any type
of medicine, taken by another state or the surrender of a license while under investigation by any
licensing authority is grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

ll. Respondent was disciplined by another state when the Medical Board of California
filed an eleven (11) count Complaint against Respondent, and subsequently then the Board and
Respondent entered into a Stipulated Surrender of License and Order, resulting in the
Respondent’s forfeiture of his medical license and requiring him to pay twenty-eight thousand six
hundred ninety-six dollars and twenty-five cents ($28,696.25) in costs.

12. Respondent was disciplined by another state when the Alabama Board of Medical

a probationary status and requiring him to pay fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) in fines.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

California despite being licensed in four other states, including Alabama.

Respondent stating that he was scheduled to be “booked and released at the Sacramento jail on
