Patient A’s past medical history included a diagnosis of steroid-dependent Crohn’s Disease,
developmental delay, chronic debility, and weakness.
4. On November 8, 2019, Patient A was transferred to Dignity Health Rehabilitation

Facility (hereinafter, “Dignity Health”) for inpatient care of Patient A’s ongoing medical

conditions.
5. Prior to transfer on November 8, 2019, Patient A’s hemoglobin level was recorded
as 114 gidl.
6. Patient A’s prescriptions at the time of admission to Dignity Health included an

anticoagulant medication (Equilis) and an antiplatelet. medication (Aspirin), along with
prednisone. Patient A was continued on these medications while at Dignity Health.

7. Equilis may cause active intemal bleeding, and typically takes twenty-four (24) to
forty-eight hours (48) to leave the system once stopped,

8 On November 10, 2019, Patient A’s hemoglobin level was noted to drop to 9.8
dl, indicating the possibility of gastrointestinal (Gl) bleeding.

9. Respondent first consulted with Patient A on November 11, 2019. Respondent
noted that Patient A’s hemoglobin was low, and that Patient A could not confirm if he had noticed
blood in his stools. Respondent planned to have Patient A’s hemoglobin levels monitored while
on Equilis, and have Patient A monitored for GI bleeding.

10. On November 11, 2019, Dignity Health staff noted that Patient A began having
black stools. Patient A continued to have black, water stools at approximately midnight on
November 12, 2019.

11. On November 12, 2019, Patient A’s hemoglobin levels dropped critically low to
7.0 g/dl, and then several hours later dropped down to 6.8 g/dl. Respondent ordered that Patient
A’s Eliquis and Aspirin be discontinued, but Patient A was not transferred to the hospital.

12, That same day, Respondent noted that he was still concerned about GI bleeding
and again noted that he asked Patient A about the color of his stools. There is no documentation
from Respondent referring to nursing notes that clearly documented multiple black stools.

Respondent also documented that Patient A had tachycardia.
