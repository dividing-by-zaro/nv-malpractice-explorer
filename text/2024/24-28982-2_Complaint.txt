treatment plan. Respondent then prescribed Patient A buprenorphine, but did not document any
evidence that a discussion about informed consent took place prior to the prescription of
controlled substances to Patient A.

4. ‘On August 20, 2019, Respondent prescribed Patient A Risperdal, an antipsychotic
medication. Respondent did not include a review of prior records, any documentation, nor any
comprehensive examination in his records to support a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder that
would justify prescribing Risperdal. Moreover, Respondent also failed to document whether
Patient A received informed consent or alternatives to Risperdal prior to delivery of the
prescription.

5. On November 6, 2019, Respondent prescribed Patient A Zoloft, an SSRI
antidepressant. Respondent did not include any documentation or examination in his records to
support an appropriate diagnosis of depression that justifies the prescription for Zoloft, nor did
Respondent document that Patient A received informed consent or alternatives to Zoloft prior to
delivery of the prescription.

6. In total, Respondent saw Patient A from July 7, 2019, through January 8, 2020.
Throughout Patient A’s treatment, Respondent did not include documentation that he checked
Patient A’s Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) report prior to prescribing Patient A
controlled substances in violation of Nevada law, especially given Patient A’s history of|
medication dependence.

7. Throughout Respondent’s treatment of Patient A, Respondent required urine drug
screenings which required Patient A to pay out-of-pocket for the tests despite having Medicare.
Respondent did not have a valid Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment (CLIA) waiver
for the point-of-care testing offered in his practice to charge payments to his patients.

8. On January 8, 2020, Patient A was noted by Respondent to be a “no call, no show”
whereupon Respondent ceased his medical care of Patient A. Respondent documents no further
effort to contact Patient A or refer him to an appropriate clinician to maintain his prescription.
