Against: FILED

ZIAD AHMED SAWI, M.D., JUL 11 2024

Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

MEDI EXAMINER;
By: rs Oe

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Alexander J. Hinman, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Ziad Ahmed Sawi, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10533). Respondent was originally
licensed by the Board on July 1, 2003, and has a specialty in anesthesiology.

2. Patient A? was a sixty-two (62) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On August 28, 2019, Patient A presented to Respondent with a chief complaint of
“shoulder pain.” Respondent’s evaluation noted thoracic pain of the T4-5 region of the spine.
Also, during this visit, Respondent reviewed an MRI of Patient A’s thoracic spine, noting that it
showed, “disc pathology at the T6-7 and T7-8 levels, consistent with [Patient A’s] physical

symptomatology.”

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Chowdhury H. Ahsan, M.D., Ph.D., FACC,
Ms. Pamela J. Beal, Irwin B. Simon M.D., FACS.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4, In the medical notes, Respondent stated that he planned to proceed with a “right-
sided T6-7, T7-8 TESI” (transforaminal epidural steroid injection), a procedure that does not cure
the condition, but can provide pain relief to the patient, and that Patient A “will receive an IV
push,” meaning, Patient A would be put under anesthesia for the TESI’s.

5. The American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) has published a position statement

3 which provides that deep

on “Anesthetic Care During Interventional Pain Procedures for Adults
sedation is not necessary with TESI procedures.

6. On August 30, 2019, at 11:16 a.m., Patient A was taken to the operating room and
anesthesia was administered by another anesthesiologist pursuant to Respondent’s directive, and
Patient A received three (3) successive doses of IV Propofol (100mg each), while Respondent
performed the TESI’s on Patient A’s right T6-7 and T7-8 vertebrae.

7. The procedure finished at 11:31 a.m. According to the procedure note, the
injectate used was “Solu-Medrol in 1% preservative-free Xylocaine...”.

8. Respondent knew, or should have known, that the blood supply to the thoracic
spinal cord is predominantly from the anterior spinal artery, and if that blood supply is
compromised, it will result in permanent neurologic impairment, especially flaccid paralysis or
severe weakness and there was a risk of occlusion (blockage or closing of a blood vessel) of the
anterior spinal artery that is associated with a thoracic TESI procedure.

9. Further, Respondent knew, or should have known, that the risk of impaired blood
supply to the spinal cord was accentuated by the use of a particulate steroid, as was used in this
procedure. “Solo-Medrol” as referenced in the procedure note, is the brand name for
methylprednisolone, and it is the steroid with the largest particles.

10. The medical record indicates that shortly after Patient A awoke from her thoracic
injections, she complained of pain, numbness, and tingling. Respondent then brought Patient A
back to the OR for a left SI joint injection. The rationale for proceeding with the left SI joint

injection on an urgent basis is unclear and is not documented. Further, a medical indication for

3 “Anesthetic Care During Interventional Pain Procedures for Adults.” states, “[e]xamples of procedures that
typically do not require sedation but are not limited to epidural steroid injections, epidural blood patch, trigger point
injections, injections into the shoulder, hip, knee, facet, and sacroiliac joints, and occipital nerve blocks.” (Emphasis
added.)

15,

performing such a procedure is based upon a presumed SI joint pathology or inflammation and is
not indicated in instances of acute numbness/tingling in the legs and low back pain.

11. Respondent knew or should have known, that the acute onset of bilateral lower
extremity numbness and tingling should not be treated with a left SI joint injection. Further,
Respondent also again sedated Patient A by administering midazolam (2mg) while performing the
left SI joint injection, which is again, not medically necessary for thoracic epidural injections.

12. After the final injection, an MRI was performed, and after reviewing the results,
Patient A was transferred to Southern Hills Hospital via ambulance.

13. Respondent’s Operative Report notes state, “[u]pon completion of the procedure,
there were no problems encountered,” and that “[t]he patient tolerated the procedure well. He
goes on to say, “[a]fter a period of observation in the recovery, the patient was discharged into the
hands of the ‘driver,” meaning the ambulance driver.

14. Patient A was then hospitalized for seven (7) days immediately following
Respondent’s procedure and was not discharged from Southern Hills Hospital until
September 5, 2019. From there she was transported to a rehabilitation hospital.

15. On January 20, 2020, Patient A was seen at the Cleveland Clinic and was
diagnosed with iatrogenic cervicothoracic syrinx formation caused by Respondent’s injection.
Providers at the Cleavland Clinic diagnosed Patient A with Central Pain Syndrome that included
leg and arm weakness and difficulty walking.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

16. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

17. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

18. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar

circumstances.”

19. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, when Respondent used deep sedation and/or general
anesthesia for the thoracic transforaminal injections performed on August 30, 2019, and by using
a steroid, methylprednisolone, that is known for having a significantly high percentage of large
particles that may occlude vessels, among other things.

20. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

21. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

22. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

23. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions when he treated
Patient A, by, among other things, failing to document his medical reasoning for proceeding with
a left SI joint injection on an urgent basis and that the patient tolerated the procedure well. Thus,
Respondent’s medical records are not legible, accurate, and complete.

24. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early

Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);
