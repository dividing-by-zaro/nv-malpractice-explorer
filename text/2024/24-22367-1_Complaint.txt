hypoxia and tachycardia during his hospital stay. Additionally, Patient A’s past medical history
included a diagnosis of steroid-dependent Crohn’s Disease.

4 On or about November 5, 2019, Patient A underwent a complete blood count
(CBC) test, which demonstrated Patient A’s hemoglobin level as 12.6 grams per deciliter (g/dl).
Records from the hospital listed the reference range for Patient A’s hemoglobin level as between
12.5 and 17.5 g/dl.

5. On November 8, 2019, Patient A was transferred to Dignity Health Rehabilitation
Facility (hereinafter, “Dignity Health”) for inpatient care of Patient A’s ongoing medical

conditions. Wherein Patient A was admitted to Respondent's care

6. Prior to transfer on November 8, 2019, Patient A’s hemoglobin level was recorded
as 11.4 g/dl.
7. Patient A’s prescriptions at the time of admission to Dignity Health included an

anticoagulant medication (Equilis) and an antiplatelet medication (Aspirin).

8. Equilis may cause active internal bleeding, and typically takes twenty-four (24) to
forty-eight (48) hours to leave the system once stopped.

9. Upon admission to Dignity Health, Patient A’s risk factors for upper
gastrointestinal bleeding included, but were not limited to, taking Eliquis and Aspirin, chronic oral

Patient A with new anemia, but acknowledged GI prophylaxis in his plan. Respondent did not
document that he reviewed the other available CBC test results, other than the CBC test result
from November 8, 2019, showing a hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dl.

13. On November 10, 2019, Patient A’s hemoglobin level was noted to drop to
9.8 g/dl, indicating the possibility of major GI bleeding.

Respondent did not change his plan for Patient A, noting only “GI prophylaxis and Monitor CBC”
and noting a follow-up by another internal medicine physician.

15, An internal medicine physician also performed an examination of Patient A on
November 11, 2019, noting that Patient A’s “current hemoglobin is low” and “patient cannot
confirm if he has noticed blood in his stools.”

7.0 g/dl, and then several hours later dropped down to 6.8 g/dl. Documentation from Dignity
Health indicated that Patient A told a therapist “I am really tired today.”

17. When a patient has a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dl, has a hemoglobin drop of more
than 2.0 g/dl, and is symptomatic, a transfusion is recommended. Respondent did not document
ordering a transfusion, or transferring Patient A to an appropriate setting for a transfusion, such as
a hospital.

a stat CBC test.
