OF HIS REQUEST TO REINSTATE HIS LICENSE

)ss:
COUNTY OF CLARK )

I, GEORGE CHAMBERS, JR., M.D., Respondent in the above-referenced
matter, do solemnly declare, under penalty of perjury, that the following statements
are true:

1. That I am a licensed physician in the State of Nevada, having been

issued a medical license in 2003.

2. That on or about September 15, 2023, the Board voted to revoke my
medical license, stayed the revocation, and placed me on probation for two years,
along with other requirements, some of which are as follows:

-- Pay the costs of the proceeding in the amount of $54,217.37 by

March 15, 2024.

-- Pay fines in the amount of $6,000 by March 15, 2024.

-- Complete CPEP PROBE Ethics & Boundaries Course by March

15, 2024.

-- Complete the Professional Boundaries Program through PACE by

March 15, 2024.

3. That I completed the Professional Boundaries Program through PACE
on December 12, 2022, a few months after the Board filed a formal complaint
against me, but prior to the Board’s orders; that I am requesting that the Board
accept the course I took as meeting the requirement in the Board’s order for me to
take the same course.

4. That on or about July 24, 2024, the Investigative Committee (“IC”) of
this Board suspended my license for failure to timely comply with the Board’s
orders as outlined above; that this failure, for which I take full responsibility, was
due to several factors beyond my control, including (1) inability to secure
employment as a result of board-imposed restrictions; and (2) a contentious and
expensive divorce from my wife.

5. That I am requesting that the Board reinstate my license, so that I can
work to take care of my children and pay off the costs and fines imposed by the

Board; that it is for this purpose that I make this affidavit; that to show good faith, I

borrowed some money to make a payment of $2,500 to the Board toward the costs
of proceeding and fines; that if my license is reinstated, I will make monthly
payments to the Board until the balance is paid off; that I also have no plans to
resume my cosmetic vaginal rejuvenation practice, as all the complaints I have had,
including those that led to this case, emanated from this practice area; that I plan to
concentrate on obstetrics and gynecology; that I am, as a result, requesting
that the Board remove the requirement for me to be chaperoned, as that is already
the requirement in all hospitals and the standard of practice, which I have observed
in the 25 years of my practice; that having the chaperone as a disciplinary sanction
will prevent me from regaining my hospital privileges and board certification, both
of which I need to secure meaningful employment.
