COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through its counsel, Alexander J. Hinman, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for
the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Francis Escolin Jimenez, M.D., (Respondent)
violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative
Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint,
stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 9268). Respondent was originally
licensed by the Board on January 7, 2000, specializing in Family Practice.

2. Patient A? was a thirty-five (35) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. On or around May 15, 2018, Patient A presented to Respondent for a sexually
transmitted disease (“STD”) examination, after being informed that a previous sexual partner had
contracted an STD. Additionally, Patient A sought a refill for his existing prescriptions of
Adderall and Vyvanse.


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Aury Nagy, M.D., and
Michael C. Edwards, M.D., FACS.

? Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4. Prior to seeing Respondent in a doctor-patient capacity, Patient A knew
Respondent through the course of his employment, as Patient A was a pharmaceutical
representative for AstraZeneca and had made multiple visits to Respondent’s medical practice.

5. Patient A and Respondent developed a professional relationship; however, this
relationship became atypical when Respondent began making inappropriate comments and
behaving unprofessionally towards Patient A. This commentary and behavior occurred before,
during, and after the May 15, 2018, examination.

6. Patient A presented for an examination regarding a potential STD on
May 15, 2018, and Respondent performed a physical inspection of Patient A’s genitals for
approximately five (5) to seven (7) minutes. During the examination, Respondent told Patient A
that he wanted to put Patient A’s penis in his mouth, that he had a “really nice penis,” and that he
should be getting erect while Respondent was performing the examination.

7. There are no medical records of Respondent examining Patient A on
May 15, 2018; however, Respondent does not dispute it was performed. Further, there is no
investigation or work-up of a possible STD, and no tests were performed to determine if
Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, or HIV were present.

8. During a subsequent visit to Respondent’s office, Patient A was assaulted by
Respondent. As indicated in a police report filed by Patient A, Respondent grabbed Patient A by
his penis and buttocks and refused to let go. Further, as Patient A was trying to exit the
examination room, Respondent blocked the door and would not allow him to leave.

9. On February 26, 2019, a criminal complaint was filed, which contained four (4)
charges. Respondent entered a plea of Nolo Contendere to a lesser charge of Count | of the
Complaint, and a Judgement was entered September 24, 2020.
