VII.

If any of the foregoing Findings of Fact is more properly deemed a Conclusion of Law, it

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
I.

The Board has jurisdiction over Respondent’s medical license and the Complaint, and an

f YW N


NRS_ 630.306(1)(b)(3), Violation of the Statutes and Regulations of the Nevada Board of
Pharmacy. Accordingly, Respondent is subject to discipline pursuant to NRS 630.352.
Iv.

The Board finds that, pursuant to NRS 622.400, recovery from Respondent of reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigation and disciplinary
proceedings against Respondent is appropriate. The Board has reviewed the Investigative
Committee’s Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements and Attorneys’ Fees; and the Board finds
them to be the actual fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigative,
administrative and disciplinary proceedings against Respondent, and finds them to be reasonable
and necessary based on: (1) the abilities, training, education, experience, professional standing
and skill demonstrated by Board staff and attorneys; (2) the character of the work done, its
difficulty, its intricacy, its importance, the time and skill required, the responsibility imposed and
the prominence and character of the parties where, as in this case, they affected the importance of
the litigation; (3) the work actually performed by the Board’s attorneys and staff, and the skill,
time and attention given to that work; and (4) the product of the work and benefits to the Board
and the people of Nevada that were derived therefrom.

Vv.

If any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law is more properly deemed a Finding of Fact, it
may be so construed.

ORDER

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and good cause
appearing therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:

1. Respondent is hereby ordered to reimburse the Board the reasonable and necessary
costs and expenses actually incurred in the investigation and prosecution of this case in the amount of
nine thousand six hundred forty-nine dollars and eighty-one cents ($9,649.81), which amount
Respondent shall pay within sixty (60) days of service of this Order;

Las Vegas, NV 89118

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATION

This matter came for hearing on August 29, 2024. Participating in the hearing were
William P. Shogren on behalf of the Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners (the “IC”); Melanie Thomas, Esq. on behalf of Sassan Kaveh, M.D.
(“Respondent”), and Respondent, IC witnesses called to testify were Emesto Diaz, the IC Chief
of Investigations, and Respondent. Respondent also testified on his own behalf. All witnesses
were sworn. The rule of exclusion was invoked by Respondent.

The Complaint alleges a single count of violation of NRS 630.306(1)(b)(3), Violation of
Statutes and Regulations of the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy. The charge is premised upon
Respondent having entered into a Stipulation and Order with the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy
(the “Pharmacy Board”), filed on October 15, 2021, by which Respondent stipulated that he
violated specified Nevada statutes, inclusive of NRS Chapter 639, and/or Nevada administrative


BRRRRSRRSVESVIA RARER ES

code provisions by dispensing a dangerous drug to a patient without a valid dispensing
practitioner registration; that Respondent redispersed unused medication and thus a misbranded,
mislabeled, and potentially adulterated drug; and that Respondent did so as the holder of a Nevada
controlled substance registration in an incompetent, unskillful, or negligent manner, engaged in
unprofessional conduct, and committed an act that renders registration inconsistent with the public
interest. See IC Exhibit 5 (the “Stipulation”). As part of the Stipulation, Respondent accepted a
public reprimand by the Pharmacy Board, was to pay a fine, was to reimburse the Pharmacy
Board for fees and costs, and was ordered to comply with all federal and state statutes and
regulations regarding controlled substances and dangerous drugs. Id.

Prior to the hearing, Respondent, through motion practice, took issue with the procedural
manner by which the charge against him was initiated and pursued. Written rulings as to the same
were undertaken by a prior hearing officer who denied relief based thereon. As such, the hearing
was limited to the merits of the charge, although Respondent addressed the underlying motion
arguments in opening statement; to a limited extent, due to being restricted by the undersigned,
through questioning; and in closing.

With respect to the scope of the hearing, the merits of the underlying charge were
unequivocally established and never directly challenged. In particular, NRS 630,306(1)(b)(3)
provides that engaging in any conduct that is a violation of NRS Chapter 639 or a regulation
adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy pursuant thereto, which is applicable to a licensee who is
a practitioner as defined in NRS 639.0125, constitute grounds for initiating disciplinary action or
denying licensure. Based upon being deemed a practitioner as defined by NRS 639.0125, which
was never disputed, and having violated a provision (or provisions) of NRS Chapter 639 as
stipulated to by Respondent before the Pharmacy Board, Respondent is, in turn, in violation of
NRS 630,306(1)(b)(3) as alleged.

As and for a recommendation for discipline, given Respondent’s violation rests initially
with the Pharmacy Board and the current violation is a direct result thereof with no additional or
separately alleged violation beyond that already addressed by the Pharmacy Board; in light of the

Pharmacy Board having already disciplined Respondent for the violation underlying the charge; in



BRRRFRRBRREBSETESERARBREBESCS

consideration of Respondent’s self-reporting by and through correspondence from Respondent’s
counsel, dated November 10, 2021 (see IC Exhibit 4);! and in consideration of efforts by
Respondent to address the violation, which Respondent testified includes having undertaken
continuing medical education “in relation to the investigation” of the charge (see Hearing
Transcript, p. 97, lines 19-22), undersigned respectfully submits that Respondent's discipline
should be reflective of the discipline imposed by the Pharmacy Board absent imposition of a fine,
which would be unnecessarily duplicative, that being administration of a public reprimand; a
requirement that Respondent pay all costs incurred by the Board relating to its disciplinary
proceedings; and that Respondent be mandated to comply with all federal and state statutes and
regulations regarding controlled substances and dangerous drugs.

RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 26th day of September 2024.

Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

| Whether or not the self-reporting led to the IC charge or it came to fruition by other means was a topic of limited
inquiry at the hearing but goes to the underlying motion arguments, which had been denied.
