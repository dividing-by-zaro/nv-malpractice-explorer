COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Sidharth Gautam Sharma, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 16901). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on January 24, 2017.

2. Patient A? was a forty-two (42) year-old female at the onset of the events at issue.

3. Patient A was first seen by Respondent, a psychiatrist, for treatment on or about
October 10, 2018. Prior to this date, Patient A had been seen by a colleague of Respondent.
Patient A then saw Respondent numerous times, either in-person or remotely, between October
2018 to at least December 2020.


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D. , Carl N. Williams, Jr.,
MLD., and Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.).

? Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4. Starting on or about October 10, 2018, Patient A was treated by Respondent for
ongoing major depressive order, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and
insomnia. Respondent also later treated Patient A for bipolar disorder.

5. During the October 10, 2018, visit with Patient A, Respondent continued
Patient A’s prescription of two (2) different benzodiazepines, Restoril (to be taken for insomnia)
and Xanax (to be taken for anxiety), both of which are classified as Schedule IV controlled
substances by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

6. Respondent’s progress notes from this date do not document any attempts to
quantify or qualify Patient A's symptoms of anxiety. Further, Respondent’s progress notes from
this date do not document the clinical rationale for concomitantly prescribing two (2) Schedule IV
controlled substances.

7. Additionally, on October 10, 2018, Respondent’s progress notes indicate that
Patient A stated she did not want to change her medication regimen. However, on that date,
Respondent increased Patient A’s Xanax dosage from 0.5 mg once a day as needed, to 1.0 mg
twice daily as needed. Respondent also increased the amount of Xanax supplied, from fifteen (15)
tabs per prescription to sixty (60) tabs per prescription. Respondent’s progress notes do not
document the clinical rationale for this increase.

8. On June 11, 2019, Respondent met with Patient A and, despite Patient A’s report of
a decrease in anxiety symptoms, Respondent again increased Patient A’s Xanax dosage, from 1.0
mg twice daily to 1.0 mg three times daily. Respondent’s progress notes do not document the
clinical rationale for this increase in dosage in Patient A’s medication.

9. On or about April 7, 2020, Respondent met with Patient A via a telepsychiatric
encounter. Upon information and belief, Patient A by this time had relocated from Nevada to
Arizona. Patient A’s medical records do not mention Patient A’s relocation and do not document
any process of referral to providers in Arizona.

10. On or about April 7, 2020, Respondent continued Patient A’s prescription for
Restoril for insomnia. Respondent also started Patient A on Ativan. Respondent’s progress notes

do not document the clinical rationale for initiating Ativan. Respondent also continued Patient

15,

A’s prescription for Xanax, to be started after the Ativan prescription ended. Respondent did not
include on this date any specific documentation of the clinical rationale for prescribing three
different benzodiazepines (Restoril, Xanax, and Ativan), all of which are classified as Schedule IV
controlled substances by the DEA.

11. Respondent met with Patient A again via telepsychiatric encounter on
August 12, 2020, and December 3, 2020. On these dates, Respondent continued Patient A’s
prescriptions for Restoril and Xanax, among other prescriptions.

12. Additionally, during Patient A’s visits with Respondent described above,
Respondent’s notes did not document any reasoning for prescribing controlled substances instead
of first attempting alternative treatment options.

13. Respondent further did not document a complete assessment of Patient A’s risk for
abuse, dependency, and addiction that had been validated through peer-reviewed scientific
research, during Patient A’s visits described above. Respondent further did not document that
Patient A ever entered into a Prescription Medication Agreement, as required by NRS 639.23914,
during any of Patient A’s visits described above.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

14. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

15. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

16. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

17. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
treating Patient A, when Respondent 1) did not justify concomitantly prescribing multiple

Schedule IV controlled substances, including Ativan, Restoril, and Xanax, 2) failed to perform a

more thorough assessment of Patient A’s condition, including further quantification and
qualification of Patient A’s reported symptoms of anxiety or any discussion with Patient A
regarding alternative treatment options not requiring the use of a controlled substance, and 3)
increased Patient A’s Xanax without justification on or about October 10, 2018, and June 11,
2019.

18. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II

19. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

20. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

21. Respondent failed to maintain legible, accurate, and complete medical records
relating to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his
actions when he treated Patient A, including the justification for 1) prescribing multiple Schedule
IV controlled substances concomitantly, 2) increasing Patient A’s Xanax dosage on October 10,
2018 and June 11, 2019, 3) initiating a prescription for Ativan on or about April 7, 2020, and
4) prescribing multiple controlled substances instead of attempting alternative treatment options.
Respondent further failed to maintain legible, accurate, and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment, and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document 1) a review of
Patient A’s medical records or any attempts to obtain the records, 2) Patient A’s risk for abuse,
dependency, and addiction, 3) that Patient A entered into a Prescription Medication Agreement for
any of the prescribed controlled substances, and 4) Patient A’s relocation from Nevada to Arizona
or any process of referral to providers in Arizona.

22. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.

23. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

24, in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set
forth herein.

25. Continual failure by the Respondent to exercise the skill or diligence or use the
methods ordinarily exercised under the same circumstances by physicians in good standing
practicing in the same specialty or field is grounds for disciplinary action against a licensee
pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(g).

26. Respondent continually failed to exercise skill or diligence as demonstrated by his
repeated failure to correctly document his actions when he treated Patient A during multiple visits
between 2018 and 2020, his repeated increase of Patient A’s Xanax dosage without any clinical
rationale, and his repeated prescription of multiple Schedule IV controlled substances
concomitantly without any clinical rationale.

27. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:
