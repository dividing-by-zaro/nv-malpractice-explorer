The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 11350). Respondent was

4. Patient A was given one (1) liter of saline treatment before any routine bloodwork
was performed.

5. Results of a serum sodium lab test showed Patient A had hyponatremia, or a low
sodium concentration.

6. Between approximately 1:00 p.m. and 2:21 p.m., Patient A’s serum sodium level
began at 107 and raised to 110, which is considered a rapid correction. Despite the rapid
correction, the saline treatment was not stopped after the lab reports were received.

7. Later in the day on January 1, 2019, another physician admitted Patient A to the
hospital and despite the rapid correction, continued the saline treatment until she could be
transferred to Mountain’s Edge Hospital.

8 Upon admission to Mountain’s Edge Hospital, Patient A was displaying multiple
symptoms of rapid correction, but another serum sodium lab test was not taken until
approximately midnight on January 1, 2019, and the level had risen again from 109 to 118,
amounting to a 9 mEq correction in a ten (10) hour span.

9. Respondent assumed care of Patient A on January 2, 2019. The hospitalist APRN
‘on duty was notified that Patient A’s serum sodium level was at 122 at approximately 3:30 a.m.,
but a nephrology consult was not requested until 4:30 p.m. by Respondent.

10. The sodium infusion was not discontinued until 6:08 p.m. on January 2, 2019.
After cessation of the fluids Patient A’s sodium serum continued to rise to a level of 130.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

11, All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein,

12. NRS 630,301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating

14. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
Respondent did not adhere to the standard of care for a patient with hyponatremia by not
recognizing Patient A had started rapid correction or that the patient was at risk for rapid
correction.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

‘TH

NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) -
16. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

‘iolation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation

reference as though fully set forth herein.

17. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

18. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of|
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

19. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition and rapid correction on January 2, 2019, and Respondent should have consulted with an
appropriate care provider to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical
condition and such a timely consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and
may have enhanced the quality of medical care provided to Patient A regarding treatment of her
hyponatremia. A nephrology consult was requested, but long after Patient A had been exhibiting

symptoms of rapid correction in her serum sodium levels.
20. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
