5. Prior to the injections, Respondent failed to perform and/or document an
appropriate examination to support the performance of stem cell injections in Patient A’s spine
including documentation of a previous history of conservative treatment, diagnostic dise
injections, and a review of the MRI imaging in the medical record.

6. The stem cell product utilized by Respondent was comprised of non-autologous
umbilical stem cells which were not FDA-approved. Prior to injecting Patient A with the non-
FDA-approved stem cell treatment, Respondent failed to obtain an appropriate informed consent
from Patient A which did not indicate the diagnosis, provided the specific anticipated procedure to
be performed, and stated adequately and clearly that the product being utilized was non-FDA-
approved. However, Respondent did not inform Patient A that the FDA had not approved stem
cell therapy for the treatment of any orthopedic condition.

7. On September 17, 2018, the manufacturer of the stem cell product utilized by
Respondent announced that the stem cells were tainted with E. coli.

8. Patient A ultimately required hospitalization for difficulty standing and severe back
pain. An MRI image of Patient A’s lumbar spine demonstrated osteomyelitis in the bone at the
disc spaces where the stem cell product was injected, and Patient A was diagnosed with E. Coli
bacteremia and sepsis.
