COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Deonne E. Contine, General Counsel and attomey for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Hilary Lynn Malcarney, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

L Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10754). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on December 29, 2003.

2. Patient A? was a sixty-three (63) year-old male at the time of the events at issue in
this Complaint.

pain, Over the next several years, Respondent periodically treated Patient A with steroid injections

4. On July 16, 2018, Patient A saw Respondent for continued pain in his right knee.
Records show that Respondent again suggested injections for treatment but because he had limited
pain relief from previous conservative treatment, and after discussion about the procedure,
Patient A indicated his desire for a total knee replacement.

5. Patient A saw Respondent for a preoperative appointment on January 23, 2019,
during which he consented to the surgery and on February 5, 2019, Respondent performed a right
total knee arthroplasty on Patient A.

6. Records indicate that at the time of surgery the initial placement of the 5-degree
intramedullary guide (femoral jig) did not allow for a cut to the medial bone, so the jig was moved
back from 9mm to 12mm.

7. This readjustment resulted in a significant valgus malalignment of the right femoral
component because this original malalignment of the jig reinforced the incorrect angle at a more
proximal level.

8. Post operative imaging evidenced the alignment of the knee in valgus in relation to
the mechanical axis.

9. Patient A did not recover well from the total knee arthroplasty surgery. He had
some initial healing issues including cellulitis (which recovered well with treatment). Patient A
saw Respondent for six (6) post operative appointments during which he continued to complain of
swelling and pain.

10. On March 5, 2019, Patient A sought a second opinion from Eric Boyden, M.D.
related to continued pain in his right knee. Chart notes from this initial visit of Patient A indicate
that Patient A presented with “. . . severe, severe pain that is persisting. He cannot be on his leg for
any period of time. He has also noticed that the angle of his knee does not seem right to him. He
seems like he is a little bit more knock-kneed than what he would expect.””

11. Dr. Boyden’s notes indicate his review of four (4) views of Patient A’s knee
including a full-length standing view which showed the distal cut on the femur to be about 10
degrees over ideal.

12. Based on Dr. Boyden’s examination and records review, it was explained to
Patient A that the knee replacement would need to be redone with a revision of the femoral
competent.

13. On March 27, 2019, Dr. Boyden performed a right total knee arthroplasty on
Patient A.

14. Patient A continued to see Dr. Boyden for post operative care until his last
appointment on July 30, 2019, in which chart notes state Patient A has no complaints, his knee did
not hurt, and Patient A was doing well after revision surgery. Patient A was discharged from Dr.
Boyden’s care with the instruction that if he had any setbacks or issues, he should contact Dr.
Boyden for additional care.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

15. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

16.  NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

17, NAC 630,040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

18. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A when she failed to recognize intraoperatively the valgus
malalignment of the right femoral component and therefore, did not correct her original and all
subsequent cuts. Additionally, Respondent, while noting no evidence of any component loosening
in the post operative x-ray studies, did not comment on the clear valgus malalignment in the right
knee shown in the x-rays.

19. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
