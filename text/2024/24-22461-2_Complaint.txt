acetamin, oxycodone-acetaminophen, and tramadol).

30. _ However, Respondent did prescribe Patient A benzodiazepines from January 2018
to July 2019, and Respondent knew or should have known that Patient A was being prescribed
opioids by another prescribing provider at that same time.

31. Patient A’s Patient Report from the PMP confirms that she was receiving both
benzodiazepines and opioids at the same time. Further, the medical records of Patient A reflect
the use of both benzodiazepines and opioids at the same time in her “current medications” list as
cited above in factual allegations ¥ 4 to 26.

32. It is concerning that multiple types and strengths of benzodiazepines
(five (5) different types) and opioids (three (3) different types) are reflected in Patient A’s medical
records throughout the her treatment timeline with Respondent.

33. Patient A’s Patient Report from the PMP does not support that she was actually
taking five (5) different benzodiazepines and three (3) different opioids at the same time. Instead,
it appears that the multiple types and strengths of benzodiazepines and opioids in Patient A's
medical records 1s a failure by Respondent to ensure that Patient A’s medical records correctly
reflected what medications she was actually taking at the time of each visit.

34, Patient A’s other medications contained in her medical records throughout this time
period also appear to be inaccurate showing additional discrepancies such as three (3) different
strengths of Adderall each taken once per day, Bactrim DS 800-160 mg being taken by Patient A
from January 18, 2018, through July 22, 2019,° two (2) different strengths of Ritalin each taken
once per day, and two (2) different strengths of Zoloft each taken once per day.

35. The discrepancies noted in factual allegation at 4 32 to 34 constitute a failure by
Respondent to ensure that Patient A’s medical records correctly reflected what medications she

was actually taking at the time of each visit.

* Bactrim DS 800-160 mg is an antibiotic used to treat infections Upon information and belief tis unlikely
that Patient A would take an antibiotic for more than a year without a history of infections or other medical issues
being noted. Patient A's medical records maintained by Respondent reflect no history of urinary tract infections or
other conditions that may warrant the use of an antibiotic, ‘There is a note about Pauent A having a urinary tract
infection in January 2019 in the records maintained by another health care provider providing care to Patient A during
this same time period. However, Respondent's records reflect no such note, just continuing use of antibiotics by
Patient A at every visit with Respondent during this tume period. Upon information and belief, the reference to
Patient A's use of Bactrim DS 800-160 mg form January 18, 2018, to July 22, 2019, is an example of Respondent's
failure to maintain clear, legible, accurate, and complete medical records for Patient A.

36. Upon information and belief, Respondent copied and pasted progress notes from
visit to visit for Patient A, which led to a failure to maintain clear, legible, accurate, and complete
medical records for Patient A.

37. Upon information and belief, Respondent's care of Patient A showed a lack of|
diligence in both documentation, review, and management of her medications which fell below
the standard of care

38. In his response to the Board Investigator regarding Patient A, Respondent stated “I
check the PMP regularly.”

39. If the statement in J 38 was true, Respondent should have been aware of Patient
A’s concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids.

40. However, the PMP records show that Respondent did not conduct a query of
Patient A’s prescription history in the PMP to obtain her Patient Report at any time from
January 2018 to July 2019.

41. The quantities of controlled substances prescribed to Patient A by Respondent did
not always match the progress notes in Patient A’s medical records.

42. At times, Respondent provided Patient A with prescriptions that were more than a
thirty (30) day supply, even though he was seeing her monthly to manage her medications.

43. Respondent was out of the United States from November 8, 2019, to
December 8, 2019.

Treatment of Patient B

44, Patient B® was a forty-seven (47) year-old male at the ume of the events at issue.
45. Respondent wrote a prescription for a Schedule III controlled substance, Suboxone,
for Patient B on November 8, 2019.

B received the prescription from Respondent.

47. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not examine Patient B on
November 8, 2019, prior to giving him the prescription for the Schedule III controlled substance,
which is a violation of the standard of care.

48. The prescription for Patient B was a paper prescription dated November 8, 2019,
that contained a signature from Respondent.”

49. Respondent was out of the country on November 8, 2019.

50. Respondent stated in his response to the Board investigator that “I have never seen
this patient in any setting that I can remember. I did not give him any prescription. I do not have
a record of seeing him or treating him.”

51. Upon information and belief, Respondent allowed another person in his office to
either sign his name to the prescription for Patient B or Respondent pre-signed the prescription for
Patient B prior to leaving the country.

52, PMP records show that Respondent did not check Patient B’s Patient Report from
the PMP until February 2020.

53 If Respondent’s statement to the Board investigator as contained in 50 was true
and Patient B was never his patient, it would be a violation of law for Respondent to check
Patient B’s Patient Report in the PMP in February 2020.

54, PMP records do not show that Respondent conducted queries of Patient B in the
PMP prior to prescribing controlled substances to him or every ninety (90) days after prescribing
controlled substances to him as required by Nevada law.

55. A review of Patient B’s Patient Report from the PMP shows that Patient B was
given a refill for Valium too early.

56. Respondent gave Patient B a thirty (30) day supply of Valium (quantity 60, 5 mg)
on April 11, 2019, April 24, 2019, and May 9, 2019

57. According to Patient B’s Patient Report from the PMP, all three (3) of these

prescriptions, in addition to others, were written by Respondent.

7 Please note that the prescription provided to Patient B contains a signature that looks very much like
Respondent's signature as seen in other medical records in this matter and other Board matters. This 1s unlike the
Prescriptions provided to Patients C, D, and E that contain Respondent's handwritten name, but do not look like his
signature.

79 Respondent wrote a prescription for Patient E for Klonopin on November 15, 2019.

80. Respondent is referenced in some documents from Sana as the attending physician
for Patient E during her stay at Sana.

81. Upon a review of the Patient Report from the PMP for Patient E, Patient E also
received and filled another prescription for Klonopin from DP, APRN on November 15, 2019.

82. Both prescriptions for Patient E are for a quantity of 60, 1 mg tablets for 30 days.

83. Respondent was out of the country on November 15, 2019.

84. Sana records support that Patient E was actually seen by ML, M.D. and DP, APRN.
while at Sana.

85. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not examine Patient E on
November 15, 2019, prior to giving her the prescription which 1s a violation of the standard of
care.

86. The prescription for Patient E was a paper prescription dated November 15, 2019,
that contained a signature from Respondent and/or Respondent's handwritten name."

87. _Delegating signatory approval for Patient E for the prescription is a violation of the
standard of care.

88. Upon information and belief, Respondent allowed another person in his office to
either sign his name to the prescription for Patient E or Respondent pre-signed the prescription for
Patient E prior to leaving the country.

89. PMP records do not show that Respondent conducted queries of Patient E in the

PMP prior to prescr

ing controlled substances to her or every ninety (90) days after prescribing
controlled substances to her as required by Nevada law.

90. In response to the Board investigator regarding Patient C, D, and E, Respondent
concedes that he traveled on the days that prescriptions were provided to those patients and stated
that “I would guess that they used my name to fill a prescription” and that he “did not authorize
the prescription in any way.”

' The signature for Respondent on this prescription looks different than other signatures for Respondent
shown in other documents. It ts possible that Respondent's name was simply written on the prescription by another

staff member. For example, the signature from Respondent on the paper prescription for Pauent B looks different
than that on the prescription for Patient E.
