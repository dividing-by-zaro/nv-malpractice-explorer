COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Donald K. White, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Carolyn Anne Matzinger, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1 Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10187). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on June 1, 2002.

A. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient A

es Patient A? was a forty-five (45) year old female at the time of the events at issue
with a severe form of breast cancer, severe anemia, diabetes mellitus, Idiopathic
Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), cardiomyopathy, hypertension, “adrenal fatigue”, and gut
dysfunction.

Vii

' The Invest tee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D., Ms. April
Mastroluca, and Victor M. Muro, M.D.

2 Patient A's true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint,

3. Patient A was seen by Respondent from September 30, 2015 through May 5, 2016.
Patient A chose to decline all treatments for her aggressive breast cancer, including surgery,

chemotherapy, and radiation.

4. Patient A underwent multiple therapies while under Respondent’s care, including

multiple intravenous (IV) lipid infusions with the Patricia Kane protocol (“PK protocol”),
craniosacral therapy, biomed lipid colon cleanse (enemas), infrared saunas, and vitamin C
infusions.

5. Throughout Patient A’s entire treatment, there is minimal documentation of|
examination findings regarding her increasing breast mass or other complaints.

6. Respondent failed to document Patient A’s present medications or doses.
Medications are documented on the NeuroLipid research foundation questionnaire that Patient A.
filled out, but not listed in Respondent's notes.

7. On October 8, 2015, Patient A was seen by a surgeon for a surgical opinion and a
PET scan regarding her breast mass, The surgeon recommended she not receive a PET scan since
Patient A had previously declined further interventions for her breast tumor. However, despite the
surgeon’s recommendation, a PET scan was completed the very next day, on or about October 9,
2015.

8. No documentation exists explaining why the PET scan was performed (against the
direction of the surgeon) or justification for the reasoning behind ignoring the surgeon’s opinion.

Ls Further, a report dated December 24, 2015, indicated that Patient A had a bacterial
infection known as Acinetobacter Baumannii related to her necrotic breast tumor. Respondent
failed to treat this infection.

10. Between March 7, 2016 and May 6, 2016, Respondent saw Patient A several times
without examination or documentation of her breast tumor or any measurements of it or its
progression.

11. On May 9, 2016, Respondent recorded a brief note in Patient A’s medical records

stating, “there is increased erosion of tumor through skin.” Before this note, there was no

documentation made by Respondent about Patient A’s tumor. However, in January and February


OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL.

(75) 688-2559

of 2016, staff recorded two (2) times that Patient A’s tumor had increased in size, therefore
Respondent failed to recognize the severity of the threat of the tumor to Patient A’s declining
health.

12. Patient A was routinely treated, throughout her course of treatment, with IV lipid
infusions through a PICC line. Neither the substance nor the treatment is FDA approved.

13. Throughout the time Respondent treated Patient A, she misdiagnosed her several
times. Respondent documented a diagnosis of ITP, an autoimmune disease that causes low blood
platelet counts when Patient A actually had elevated platelet counts based on all the lab reports in
her records. Respondent also diagnosed Patient A with “adrenal fatigue,” which is not a
recognized diagnosis and is, in fact, a misdiagnosis, because Patient A’s fatigue was due to an
onset of extreme anemia from acute and chronic blood loss from her open wound related to her!
diagnosis of breast cancer.

14. From October 2015 through April 2016 Respondent administered to Patient A at
least fifty (50) colonic treatments. Colonic treatments have not been shown to be effective in the
treatment of disease.

15. Patient A was charged two hundred fifty dollars ($250) for each of the colonic
treatments received and five hundred fifty dollars ($550) for each of the multiple IV lipid
infusions, for a total cost to Patient A of over twelve thousand five hundred dollars ($12,500).

16 On April 22, 2016, a long, stringy substance was obtained from Patient A’s GI tract
after a colonic treatment. When a patient passes something abnormal from their colon, standard
practice is to collect a stool sample which should be sent to a pathological laboratory to identify
exactly what the substance is. Respondent did not follow this standard practice as it pertained to
treatment of Patient A.

17. Respondent failed to obtain informed consent from Patient A, which should include
information about therapies used, the possible risks, costs, and expected benefits of alternative
treatment compared to standard treatment, as well as the risks of declining treatment. Respondent
further did not inform Patient A that the substances were obtained from outside the United States.

68. Stage IV chronic renal disease and hyperparathyroidism are serious conditions that
|were negatively affecting Patient B and required specialized treatment. Respondent is specialized
in internal medicine, but not endocrinology or nephrology. Respondent treated Patient B for these
medical issues without consulting or referring Patient B to a physician with a specialty that could
provide treatment for these disorders. Therefore, Respondent violated NAC 630.210 by not
consulting another provider of healthcare in these doubtful and/or difficult cases which could have
lenhanced the quality of medical service provided to Patient B.

constitutes grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

76. Treatment of a patient such as Patient B that has serious medical issues by a doctor
such as Respondent, whose specialty is internal medicine, without consultation or guidance by
doctors specialized in treatment of a patient with Patient B’s specific clinical presentation, is
loperating outside the scope of her license. Respondent knew, or had reason to know, she was
loutside the scope of her training when prescribing hormone replacement medications, including
pregnenolone, BiEst cream, progesterone SR, and testosterone cream for stage IV chronic renal
disease and hyperparathyroidism. Respondent should have referred Patient B to a proper
lendocrinology and/or phrenology physician for treatment of these illnesses.

77. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

C. Respondent's Treatment of Patient C

80. Patient C was very ill and had been previously treated with a number of|
supplements, three (3) years of IV Essentiale-N infusions, as well as over eighty (80) hyperbaric
loxygen submersions in the State of Oregon prior to being evaluated by Respondent.

81. Respondent treated Patient C with PK protocol, IV infusions, and enemas,
presumably for autism, developmental delay, and anxiety. These treatments were provided at a
‘significant cost to Patient C and are not standard treatment for these medical diagnoses.

82. Respondent failed to obtain informed consent from Patient C, or his family, which
should have included information about therapies used, the possible risks, costs, and expected
benefits of alternative treatment compared to standard treatment, as well as the risks of declining
treatment. Respondent further did not inform Patient C that the substances were obtained outside
ithe United States.

83. Respondent did not perform a physical examination of Patient C at the initial
|evaluation and no physical examinations were done at any subsequent visits thereafter.

84. Vital signs taken by Respondent of Patient C did not include his height or weight.
Vital signs obtained during IV infusions confirmed elevated blood pressure readings of: 134/89 on
August 24, 2017, and 154/99 on August 28, 2017.

85. Respondent did not evaluate Patient C’s recorded hypertension, did not attempt to
treat it, and did not coordinate with other treating providers to help alleviate and treat it.

86. Respondent treated Patient C with IV lipid infusions through a PICC line as part of,
ithe “IV PK Protocol Infusion.” Neither the substance nor the treatment is FDA approved.

87. Previous records indicated a very elevated vitamin D level of 296.0 ng/mL, which
is a toxic level of vitamin D in Patient C’s system. Respondent did not recognize the elevated
|vitamin D, did not address the abnormality, nor did she send Patient C to a specialist to be treated
land detoxified from this high level of vitamin D.

88. Respondent further failed to refer Patient C to a physician(s) more specialized in
|treating the serious medical conditions of Patient C.

216. Treatment of a patient such as Patient E that has a complex medical history by a
doctor such as Respondent, whose specialty is internal medicine, without consultation or guidance
iby a doctor specialized in treatment of a patient with Patient E’s specific clinical presentation, is

loperating outside the scope of her license. Respondent knew or had reason to know she was

loutside the scope of her tr ig when prescribing enemas and IV Lipid Infusions to a wheelchair
lbound patient experiencing back pain, fatigue, and myalgia. Respondent should have referred
|Patient E to a proper pediatric and/or psychiatric physician.
217. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

218. Patient F7 was a sixty-six (66) year old female at the time of events at issue.
219 Patient F was treated by Respondent for Valley Fever, fatigue, a history of elective
bilateral mastectomies due to family history of breast cancer, subclinical hypothyroid/hypothyroid
land “adrenal fatigue”.
220. Patient F was first seen by Respondent on July 3, 2017.
221. Patient F complained of many medical conditions of which Respondent treated
lwith PK protocol IV infusions and enemas, presumably for Valley Fever, fatigue, a history of|
lelective bilateral mastectomies due to family history of breast cancer, subclinical
lhypothyroid/hypothyroid and adrenal fatigue.
222. Respondent failed to obtain informed consent, which should include information
jabout therapies used, the possible risks, costs, and expected benefits of alternative treatment
|compared to standard treatment, as well as the risks of declining treatment. Respondent further did
not inform Patient F that the substances were obtained from outside the United States.

223. Patient F was routinely provided throughout her course of treatment with enemas
land IV lipid infusions through a PICC line as part of the “IV PK Protocol Infusion.” Neither the
substance nor the treatment was FDA approved.

224. Respondent’s diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism was a misdiagnosis, as
normal thyroid lab results were documented in Patient F’s medical records.

225, There was no coordination of care with other physicians and consultants by
Respondent as it relates to the medical treatment of Patient F.

226. Respondent failed to recognize the importance of a strong family history of breast
cancer that should have been evaluated with genetic testing or at least been referred to a genetic
counselor.

227. At her first visit with Respondent, Patient F complained of fatigue, night sweats,
[skin and hair problems, but there is no indication that Respondent ever addressed her complaints.
228. Additionally, Respondent failed to address several recorded results indicating
Ihypertension.

229. The only documentation of current medications and supplements in the medical
records of Patient F was what Patient F provided on the NeuroLipid Questionnaire. Furthermore,
Ino documentation existed regarding Patient F’s allergies to Sulfa and penicillin that Patient F
included in the NeuroLipid and Biobody questionnaires.

230. A physical examination was not documented at the first visit, and subsequent
progress notes all state, “physical exam unchanged as per previous visit.” Other documentation
was cloned as well.

231. Respondent further diagnosed Patient F with “adrenal fatigue” based on abnormal
cortisol levels. Adrenal fatigue is not considered a valid medical diagnosis by the medical
community, including endocrinologists. Cortisol levels are known to fluctuate and are not
indicative of disease.
