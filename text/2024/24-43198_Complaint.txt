COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Alexander J. Hinman, Deputy General Counsel, and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Sara Kabsoun, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 15735). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on February 23, 2015.

2. Patient A? was a sixty (60) year-old female at the time of the events at issue, with a
medical history of arthritis, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and neuropathy.

3. On April 29, 2021, at 10:10 a.m., Patient A presented to the Henderson Hospital
Emergency Room (ED), with a chief complaint of vision loss, which started at 9:15 a.m., that day.
Patient A also complained of shortness of breath, chest pain, and lower right back pain.


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Aury Nagy, M.D., Ms. Maggie Arias-Petrel,
and Nicola (Nick) M. Spirtos, M.D., F.A.C.O.G.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4. Patient A’s vision loss resolved within twenty (20) minutes of onset, and there
were no other neurological symptoms reported.

5. Vital signs taken in the ED at 10:17 a.m., showed Patient A’s blood pressure of
99/40 in the left arm, and 123/65 in the right arm at 10:34 a.m., and 140/60 in the right arm at
10:46 a.m. Additionally, Patient A’s EKG was read to be sinus bradycardia, and her troponin
levels, at 10:34 a.m., were 8.7 nanograms per liter which was within normal limits.

6. Upon reevaluation of the patient, the ED physician noted that Patient A would be
admitted for a “full cardiac evaluation”.

7. Respondent’s notes for Patient A on April 29, 2021, show the presence of a history
and physical exam and was mostly consistent with the other ED physician’s notes. However,
Respondent failed to note which arm Patient A’s blood pressure readings were coming from and
never addressed the differential blood pressures between Patient A’s left and right arm, even
though the data had shown vastly different results. Further, Respondent’s notes document that
Patient A stated her pain level was a 10/10, but there is no reference to which part of the body this
pain was coming from, and Respondent specifically noted that Patient A had “no abdominal pain.”

8. On April 29, 2021, at approximately 2:00 p.m., an assessment and plan noted that
Patient A was experiencing abdominal pain, and Respondent ordered a STAT CT without
contrast. Respondent did not read the results of the CT until the next morning on April 30, 2021,
at 7:38 a.m., and without IV contrast, the diagnosis was unclear and warranted a further workup to
exclude aortic dissection.

9. On April 29, 2021, at 8:21 p.m., Patient’s A’s troponin level had increased from the
initial value of 8.7 to a critical value of 220.1, however, Patient A was not transferred to a higher
level of care.

10. On April 30, 2021, at 5:01 a.m., a nurse’s note stated Patient A had, “trending
troponin with no order given.” It is further noted that Patient A was complaining of abdominal
pain and heartburn. Patient A was also not eating due to the abdominal pain she was experiencing
and had an inability to tolerate food.

11. On April 30, 2021, at 10:19 a.m., an occupational therapist noted that Patient A’s
support level was moderate due to chest pain and dizziness. It is also noted again that Patient A
had an up-trending troponin level.

12. The final nurse’s note, dated April 30, 2021, at 11:13 a.m., stated Patient A fainted
while the CNA was changing her bed. A rapid response was called and the “code blue team” was
called. The note goes on to state that the patient had not complained of chest pain that morning.

13. On April 30, 2021, at 11:31 a.m., Patient A was pronounced deceased from an
acute myocardial infraction due to hypertension induced by diabetes; however, nowhere in the
record, including the discharge summary drafted by Respondent, was Patient A ever listed as
having diabetes, past or present.

14. Respondent’s work-up of Patient A’s past medical history, her cardiovascular risk
factors, and her symptoms when presenting to Respondent should have led to a potential diagnosis
of aortic dissection. Because of the missed diagnosis and the failure to follow up on the CT
results in a timely manner, Patient A’s treatment was jeopardized.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

15. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

16. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

17. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

18. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A. Respondent failed to correctly diagnose Patient A,
despite multiple indicators being present of possible aortic dissection, and by failing to both

follow up on, and order the STAT CT of Patient A’s abdomen with contrast.

NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

20. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

21. — NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

22. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment, and care of Patient A, by failing to document which arm the blood pressure readings
were coming from, failing to address the differential blood pressures between Patient A’s left and
right arm, and by listing diabetes as a contributing factor to Patient A’s death, despite there being
nothing in the medical record to substantiate a diagnosis of diabetes.

23. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:
