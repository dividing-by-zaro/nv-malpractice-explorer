Respondent was timely and properly served with the Complaint, and all notices and orders
in advance of the hearing and adjudication thereon, in accordance with NAC Chapter 630,
and NRS Chapters 630, 241, 622A and 233B, and all legal requirements of due process.

TL

With respect to the allegations of the First Amended Complaint, the Board concludes that
Respondent has violated the Medical Practice Act, as alleged in the Complaint, as follows. three
(3) counts of NRS 630.3065(2)(a), Knowing and Willful Failure to Comply with Investigative
Committee Order; one (1) count of NRS 630.301(9), Disreputable Conduct; one (1) count of
NRS 630.304(7), Terminating Medical Care Without Adequate Notice to a Patient; and one (1)
count of NRS 630.306(1)(), Failure to Timely Notify the Board of a Change of Permanent

Iv.

The Board finds that, pursuant to NRS 622.400, recovery from Respondent of reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigation and disciplinary
proceedings against Respondent is appropriate. The Board has reviewed the Investigative
Committee's Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements and Attorneys’ Fees; and the Board finds
them to be the actual fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigative,
administrative and disciplinary proceedings against Respondent, and finds them to be reasonable
and necessary based on: (1) the abilities, training, education, experience, professional standing
and skill demonstrated by Board staff and attomeys; (2) the character of the work done, its
difficulty, its intricacy, its importance, the time and skill required, the responsibility imposed and
the prominence and character of the parties where, as in this case, they affected the importance of
the litigation; (3) the work actually performed by the Board’s attomeys and staff, and the skill,
time and attention given to that work; and (4) the product of the work and benefits to the Board
and the people of Nevada that were derived therefrom.

This matter came for evidentiary hearing on February 27, 2024. Appearing for the hearing
‘were William P. Shogren on behalf of the Investigative Committee (the “IC”) and the undersigned
Hearing Officer. Respondent Richard David Washinsky, M.D. (“Respondent”) did not appear nor
otherwise participate.

Notice to Respondent of the date and time of the hearing was confirmed on the record. IC
Exhibits 1-21 were marked and admitted and the IC proffered evidence, which demonstrates that,
from the inception of the matter, many efforts had been taken to serve and reach out to
Respondent that included not only service to his address required to be on file with the Nevada
State Board of Medical Examiners but also emails, telephone calls, and publication of notice in
‘Lee County Florida (see Exhibit 16), which was undertaken based upon the discovery of a Federal
lawsuit against Respondent before the United States District Court for the District of Nevada
(2:22-CV-01803-APG-VCF), which similarly detailed the plaintiff therein’s many attempts to

wear anaann



a





serve Respondent and noted a Fort Myers, Lee County, Florida address for Respondent's brother
where Respondent was believed to have lived prior to perhaps moving to Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, where confirmation of newer alleged residency was not located in public records. See
Exhibit 14, Exhibit 13 further reflects that Respondent signed a certified mail receipt for an
appearance order on January 10,2022. Given the foregoing, there can be no question thet
Respondent was aware of the proceedings and intentionally chose to disregard them.

With Respondent having failed to appear and no continuance having been requested nor
‘granted, the matter was considered as scheduled pursuant to NRS 622.350, which provides:

1. Ifa party fails to appear at a scheduled hearing and a continuance
has not been scheduled or granted, any party who is present at the hearing may
make an offer of proof that the absent party was given sufficient legal notice. Upon
a determination by the regulatory body or hearing panel or officer that the absent
party was given sufficient legal notice, the regulatory body or heating panel or
officer may proceed to consider and dispose of the case without the participation of
the absent party.

2. If the licensee fails to appear at « hearing, the regulatory body or
hearing panel or officer may accept the allegations against the licensee in the
charging document as true,

Given Respondent's failure to appear, the undersigned hereby accepts all allegations
against Respondent as provided for in the Amended Complaint, filed on October 16, 2023, and
respectfully recommends that the Board uphold the six pleaded charges of: Counts I-III, Knowing
and Willful Failure to Comply with Investigetive Committeo Order, violations of NRS
£630,3065(2)(a); Count IV, Disreputable Conduct, a violation of NRS 630.301(9); Count V,
‘Terminating Medical Care Without Adequate Notice to a Patient, a violation of NRS 630.304(7);
and Count VI, Failing to Timely Notify the Board of a Change of Permanent Address, a violation
of NRS 630,306(1)(). I defer to the Board with respect to any disciplinary action it may deem
