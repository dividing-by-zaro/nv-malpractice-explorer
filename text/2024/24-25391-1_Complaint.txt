5 On December 24, 2019, following Patient A’s spinal surgery, he was transferred to
a transitional care center and placed in the charge of the Respondent.

6. Patient A was admitted at 2:25 p.m. to the care center with an elevated temperature
and heart rate and was noted to have below-average hygiene. Additionally, the post-surgical
incision dressings were noted as “bulky” and “foul smelling.” The nursing staff at the care center
administered a fever reducing medication to Patient A.

rs At 6:27 p.m., the nursing staff documented Patient A as having a persistently
elevated temperature of 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit for four (4) hours after Patient A was
administered the fever reducer.

8. Respondent was contacted by the nursing staff who left a message at 7:24 p m., at
which time Patient A’s temperature had risen to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.

9. Respondent returned the nursing staff's phone call at 10:24 p.m. and was informed

of Patient A’s raised temperature and admitting diagnosis. Respondent did not come into the
transitional care facility to examine Patient A herself, nor did she instruct staff to transfer Patient
A to an emergency room.

10. On December 25, 2019, the nursing staff coordinated Patient A’s transfer back to
the hospital. Patient A succumbed to complications from severe sepsis following his surgery on
December 27, 2019.

11. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

12, NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating

circumstances.”

14. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A by failing to appropriately examine Patient A to rule out
sepsis or send Patient A to the emergency room, despite Patient A’s persistent fever and high-risk
clinical presentation following a complex surgery.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352

TH

NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation —
Failure to Consult

16. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

17. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

18. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

19, Respondent failed to seek consultation in a timely manner with regard to Patient
A’s serious medical presentation on December 24, 2019 Respondent should have consulted with
an appropriate care provider to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical
condition. A timely consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and may have
enhanced the quality of medical care provided to Patient A with regard to the detection of his
sepsis diagnosis.

20. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.
