4. As a result of the surgery, on or about February 6, 2017, Patient A suffered an
anastomotic leak.

5. Respondent assumed care of Patient A starting on February 10, 2017. Respondent
documented that Patient A had low-grade fevers and a high white blood cell count (leukocytosis)
starting after the surgery. Respondent did not order any further evaluations of Patient A’s
condition, such as a computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis

6. On February 11, 2017, Patient A had a concerning drop in white blood cell count,
from leukocytosis to leukopenia, indicating possible sepsis. That same day, a supine abdominal
X-ray was obtained, showing the possible presence of air in Patient A’s abdominal cavity
(pneumoperitoneum).

7. The same day, the radiologist who reviewed the x-ray noted “diffuse central
lucency that could represent pneumoperitoneum.” The radiologist recommended “further
evaluation with either upright or decubitus film.”

8. On February 11, 2017, Respondent did not order an upright abdominal x-ray or CT
‘of the abdomen and pelvis. Respondent further did not order or perform an exploratory
laparotomy. Respondent's notes from this date do not indicate the possibility of an anastomotic
leak.

9 Between February 6, 2017, and February 12, 2017, Patient A also did not have any
bowel movements.

10. On February 12, 2017, Patient A’s sepsis progressed to shock, deoxygenation, and
admission to the intensive care unit. After taking diagnostics, Respondent's pre-operative
diagnosis listed free air intraperitoneal and perforated viscus. Respondent then performed an
exploratory surgery Respondent's post-operative diagnosis listed an anastomotic leak and
feculent peritonitis.

11. Between February 17, 2017, and March 10, 2017, Patient A’s condition worsened
and she developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. On March 1, 2017, Patient A began
hemodialysis.
