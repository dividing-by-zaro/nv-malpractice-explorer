COMPLAINT.

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board) hereby issues this formal Complaint against George Peter Chambers, Jr., M.D.
(Dr. Chambers), a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the
Medical Practice Act).

1. Respondent is a medical doctor currently licensed in the State of Nevada by the
Board in active-probation status (License No. 10476) since October 2, 2023, pursuant to the
provisions of NRS Chapter 630. Respondent was originally licensed by the Board on
April 30, 2003.

2. On September 15, 2023, at the Board’s regularly scheduled meeting, Respondent
was found to have violated the Medical Practice Act by violating two (2) counts of
NRS 630.301(7), Engaging in Conduct That Violates the Trust of a Patient and Exploits the
Relationship with the Patient for Financial or Other Personal Gain; one (1) count of
NRS 630.306(1)(g), Continual Failure to Practice Medicine Properly; and one (1) count of
NRS 630.301(9), Disreputable Conduct.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Bret W. Frey, M.D., Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.), and Carl N.
Williams, Jr., M.D., FACS.

3. On October 23, 2023, at 11:54 a.m., Respondent was served via USPS Certified
Mail (tracking no. 9171969009350241557513) with the Board’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of
Law and Order (FFCLO), filed by the Board on October 2, 2023, in Case No. 22-27891-1, which
provided explicit instructions regarding his specific requirements and deadlines to achieve
compliance with the Board’s Order.

4, The Board’s Order clearly stated that Respondent was ordered to complete the
following terms:

a. Sign an appropriate release with CPEP and complete and unconditionally
pass the PROBE Ethics & Boundaries Course offered by CPEP on or before March 15, 2024.?

b. Satisfactorily complete the Professional Boundaries Program through
PACE at the University of San Diego by March 15, 2024.

c. Reimburse the Board the reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred in
the investigation and prosecution of this case in the amount of fifty-four thousand two hundred
seventeen dollars and thirty-seven cents ($54,217.37) by March 15, 2024; and

d. Pay fines in the amount of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) for
each count found proven, for a total of six thousand dollars ($6,000), by March 15, 2024.

5. On March 15, 2024, Dr. Chambers, through his counsel, submitted a Petition to
Extend Certain Deadlines (Petition) via email that was received at 6:49 p.m. that day.

6. In that Petition, Dr. Chambers asked for additional time to complete the
requirements detailed above in 2(a), (c), and (d).

7. Specifically, Dr. Chambers requested that he have three (3) additional months to

complete these requirements and/or by June 15, 2024.

8. In that Petition, Dr. Chambers indicated that he had completed the requirement
detailed above in 2(b).
9. However, the IC has reviewed the document that Dr. Chambers submitted with his

Petition and that document shows that Dr. Chambers completed a program with PACE on or about

December 12, 2022, approximately five (5) months prior to the hearing that was held in this

2 Information about this course is available at https://www.cpepdoc.org/cpep-courses/probe-ethics-

matter (on May 2, 2023, May 3, 2023, June 1, 2023, and June 2, 2023) and just over nine (9)
months prior to the Board’s consideration of this matter at the Board’s September 15, 2023, Board
meeting, after which the Board’s Order dated October 2, 2023, was entered. As such,
Dr. Chambers did not complete the Professional Boundaries Program through PACE as ordered
by the Board in this matter. Any program that was completed on or about December 12, 2022,
would have been completed without the PACE Program having and utilizing the Board’s FFCLO
in order to ensure that the Board’s findings were addressed in the program.

10. Dr. Chambers’s Petition was added to the Board’s meeting agenda on June 7, 2024,
and notice was sent to Dr. Chambers and his counsel on May 6, 2024, via email and certified mail.
Neither attended the meeting on June 7, 2024, in order to address the Board regarding
Dr. Chambers’s Petition?

11. Further, the timeframe that Dr. Chambers was requesting would end in just eight
(8) days after the Board meeting.

12. On June 15, 2024, and to date, Board staff has received no payments, nor has
Board staff received proof of completion of any of the terms ordered by the Board in the FFCLO
dated October 2, 2023.


3 On March 18, 2024, the Board’s Deputy Executive Director, Sarah A. Bradley, emailed Dr. Chambers’s
counsel, Liborious Agwara, Esq., and indicated that the Petition had been received. Ms. Bradley further indicated that
the Board just had a meeting on March 1, 2024, with the next meeting scheduled for June 7, 2024, only the Board is
able to modify Board orders, and Dr. Chambers was currently not in compliance with the Board’s Order as of
March 15, 2024. She further stated that she would discuss with the Executive Director and get back to Mr. Agwara
on the issue. Subsequently, on April 5, 2024, as a courtesy, the Board’s Executive Director instructed Ms. Bradley to
inform Dr. Chambers’s counsel that he would delay enforcement of the Board’s Order until May 15, 2024, with the
hope that would allow Dr. Chambers sufficient time to complete the requirements ordered by the Board. On
April 5, 2024, the Deputy Executive Director relayed that message to Dr. Chambers’s counsel, Mr. Agwara, by email
and Mr. Agwara responded later that day saying, “thanks much for your understanding.” On May 6, 2024, the
Board’s Executive Director placed Dr. Chambers’s Petition to Extend Certain Deadlines on the Board’s June 7, 2024,
meeting agenda out of an abundance of caution, given that Board staff had not received any information from
Dr. Chambers regarding his compliance with the Board’s Order. This way, the Board could review and decide
Dr. Chambers’s request at the June Board meeting. Both Dr. Chambers and Mr. Agwara received notice of the
Petition being placed on the Board’s June meeting agenda on May 6, 2024, via email and certified mail. By
May 15, 2024, the Board had received no further information from Dr. Chambers on this issue, nor had Board staff
received any proof of compliance with the requirements ordered by the Board from Dr. Chambers. To date,
Dr. Chambers remains out of compliance with the Board’s Order and has engaged in no further communication with
Board staff on this issue.
