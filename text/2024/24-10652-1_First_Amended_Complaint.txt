a

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Ian J. Cumings, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Yaron Zedek, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and
allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 7310). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on December 15, 1994.

A. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient A

2. Patient A? was a forty-three (43) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On or about June 17, 2017, Patient A presented to Respondent for psychiatric care
and Respondent diagnosed Patient A with bipolar disorder and moderate depression. In
Patient A’s medical record, Respondent noted that she met the criteria for his diagnosis but did

Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Carl N. Williams, Jr.,

not note any symptomology to meet the criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or moderate
depression. Respondent prescribed Patient A Xanax in the amount of Img to be taken twice daily.
4. Respondent continued to see Patient A from June 2017 through January 2021 for
no less than twenty (20) follow-up visits. Respondent failed to regularly screen Patient A for
medicinal safety to discuss potential side effects of the medication prescribed by Respondent. On
each visit, Respondent documented a templated and generic mental status examination at each
visit stating:
“No suicidal or homicidal ideation. Patient is seen to have well-
delineated futuristic thoughts and plans. The patient/or legal
guardian gave informed consent for the proposed medical
treatment after careful evaluation of the risk/benefit analysis
involved, as well as alternative treatment options. The patient
and/or legal guardian was informed of potential side effects and
what to do should they arise. The patient and/or legal guardian is

aware of developing TD* and understands that TD can be
permanent, disfiguring disabling and rarely lethal.”

Respondent’s note regarding Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) does not apply to Patient A’s treatment.
Patient A was not being treated with antipsychotic drugs and this example is indicative of his
cloned medical records for Patient A.

B. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient B

5. Patient B‘ was a forty-three (43) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

6. On or about April 4, 2019, Patient B presented to Respondent for psychiatric care.
On her intake form, Patient B noted a relevant medical history of depression, anxiety, and an
eating disorder. Respondent diagnosed Patient B with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), and prescribed Vyvanse which can be contraindicated in patients with an eating
disorder. Respondent failed to include essential components of a psychiatric evaluation in the
medical record omitting the patient’s medical history, any evaluation of mental status, no
screening for homicidal ideation, and no diagnosis or treatment plan for Patient B.
Furthermore, Respondent failed to document a discussion of the risks or benefits of the

fit

3 Tardive Dyskinesia is a side effect caused by antipsychotic medication.
4 Patient B’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

medication, and any alternatives, as would be required in the process of obtaining informed
consent.

c. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient C

7. Patient C° was a thirty-six (36) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

8. On or about July 12, 2018, Patient C presented to Respondent for psychiatric care.
Respondent diagnosed Patient C with bipolar disorder and moderate depression. In the medical
record, Respondent noted that Patient C met the criteria for his diagnosis but did not note any
history of mania or specific psychiatric signs to support the diagnosis of bipolar disorder, or
moderate depression. Respondent prescribed Patient C 2mg of Xanax to be taken once a day
before bedtime without noting anxiety or insomnia in the medical record of Patient C.

9. On or about October 22, 2018, Respondent diagnosed Patient C with panic attacks,
in addition to her depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorders.

10. On or about May 9, 2019, Respondent added ADHD to Patient C’s list of
diagnoses and prescribed Adderall to Patient C.

11. On or about September 4, 2020, Patient C’s prescription monitoring program
(PMP) report demonstrated Patient C was being prescribed narcotics. On September 15, 2020,
Respondent continued to prescribe Patient C Xanax and Adderall, despite the PMP data showing
Patient C was taking additional sedatives, and stimulants, and had a moderate overdose risk
without noting any possibility of drug interactions between the different classes of medication.
Respondent additionally failed to either document or discuss altering Patient C’s medications nor
investigating alternative treatments.

12. Respondent saw Patient C from July 2018 through September 2020 on no less than
thirty (30) follow-up visits. Respondent routinely failed to discuss the risks or benefits of
alternative treatment for Patient C’s psychiatric conditions and failed to regularly screen
Patient C for medicinal safety by discussing potential side effects of the medications prescribed by
Respondent. On each visit, Respondent documented a templated and generic mental status

examination at each visit stating:

and/or legal guardian was informed of potential side effects and

Respondent’s note regarding TD does not apply to Patient C’s treatment. Patient C was not being
treated with antipsychotic drugs and this example is indicative of his cloned medical records for
Patient C.

D. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient D

13. Patient D7 was a thirty-three (34) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

14. On or about May 29, 2020, Patient D presented to Respondent for psychiatric care.
Respondent had previously diagnosed Patient D with ADHD, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, and
depression. Patient D’s PMP data demonstrated that Patient D was being prescribed opioid
medication. Despite having a moderate overdose score and taking three (3) different controlled
substances from differing therapeutic classes, Respondent failed to appropriately screen Patient D
for safety and failed to document or discuss alternatives including alternative treatments.

15. Respondent saw Patient D from April 2018 through December 2020 on no less than
thirty (30) follow-up visits. Respondent routinely failed to discuss the risks and benefits of
alternative treatment for her psychiatric conditions and failed to regularly to screen Patient D for
safety and to discuss potential side effects of the medication prescribed by Respondent.
On multiple visits, Respondent documented a templated generic mental status examination at each
visit stating:

“No suicidal or homicidal ideation. Patient Is seen to have well-
delineated futuristic thoughts and plans. The patient/or legal
guardian gave informed consent for the proposed medical
treatment after careful evaluation of the risk/benefit analysis
involved, as well as alternative treatment options. The patient
and/or legal guardian was informed of potential side effects and

Respondent’s note regarding Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) does not apply to Patient D’s treatment.
Patient D was not being treated with antipsychotic drugs and this example is indicative of his
cloned medical records for Patient D.

E. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient E

16. Patient E® was a sixty-two (62) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

17. On or about August 18, 2021, Patient E presented to Respondent for an initial
psychiatric appointment and medication refill. At the time, Patient E was taking diazepam.

18.  Respondent’s evaluation omitted substantial portions of the psychiatric evaluation,
including a lack of social history or violence, risk assessment, and an incomplete psychiatric
history including duration and treatment. Additionally, Respondent failed to document a mental
status evaluation or provide a diagnosis or treatment plan.

19. Respondent documents contradictory information to Patient E’s intake sheet,
noting that he, “is not known to have any medical problems or issues,” despite Patient E
documenting a clinically relevant history of traumatic brain injury which is associated with
psychiatric concerns, including panic disorder.

F. Respondent’s Improper Utilization of Billing Codes

20. Between the dates of January 4, 2021, and February 12, 2021, Respondent
documented seeing as many as forty (40) patients per day despite utilizing the medical billing time
code “99214” which denotes a forty-five (45) minute patient visit.

21, For example, on January 4, 2021, Respondent was scheduled to see patients
between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. for a total time of six and a half (6.5) hours of clinical time.
Despite the limited clinical time, Respondent was scheduled to see a total of sixty-seven (67)
patients including three (3) new patient evaluations and sixty-four (64) follow-ups. Patient
records demonstrate Respondent’s improper use of code 99214 for forty-five (45) minute visits
which is impossible given his clinical schedule with double-booked patients throughout January 4,
2021.


8 Patient E’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.
