NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

Respondent.

- MEPIRAL INERS

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

COMPLAINT

(Board), by and through Sarah A. Bradley, J.D., MBA, Deputy Executive Director and attorney
for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Matthew Obim Okeke, M.D., (Respondent)
violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada
Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues
its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

ll. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 14957). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on October 8, 2003.7

Respondent’s Treatment of Patient A

2. Patient A> was a thirty-seven (37) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.
3. Beginning on January 1, 2018, prescribing practitioners in Nevada are required to
obtain a patient utilization report (Patient Report) regarding the patient from the Prescription

Monitoring Program (PMP) before issuing an initial prescription for controlled substances listed

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ahsan,
M.D., PhD., FACC, and Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.) (Public Member).

2 Respondent’s original license number issued on October 8, 2003, was 10668. Respondent was issued
license number 14957 on September 6, 2013. As of the date of this Complaint, Respondent’s license is in an inactive-

probation status.
3 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient

Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

in Schedules II, Il, or IV, or an opioid that is a controlled substance listed in Schedule V, and at
least once every ninety (90) days thereafter for the duration of the course of treatment of using the
controlled substance.

4. Respondent began providing treatment to Patient A on August 16, 2018, and saw
Patient A thereafter on August 30, 2018, September 13, 2018, October31, 2018,
November 26, 2018, December 21, 2018, September 16, 2021, and October 15, 2021, according to
the medical records provided to the Board in connection with this matter’s corresponding
investigation.

5. In a letter from Respondent to the Board, dated June 24, 2022, Respondent
indicated that he “saw this patient only twice, first on 9/16/2021 and again on 10/15/21.”

6. Respondent obtained a Patient Report from the PMP for Patient A on
September 16, 2021.4

7. At the time that Respondent obtained Patient A’s Patient Report, it would have
shown that Patient A had received a prescription for “oxycodone-acetaminophen 7.5-325” written
on August 16, 2021, from another health care provider, that was filled on August 29, 2021.

8. This prescription was for thirty (30) days and totaled one hundred and twenty (120)
pills, meaning that Patient A would be taking four (4) oxycodone-acetaminophen 7.5-3.25 pills
per day.

9. On September 16, 2021, Respondent prescribed thirty (30) alprazolam { mg tablets
to Patient A, for thirty (30) days.

10. This means that, if Patient A was taking his medications as prescribed, he would
have been taking (1) alprazolam pill per day prescribed by Respondent at the same time that he
was taking four (4) oxycodone-acetaminophen pills per day.

11. The standard of care for prescribing controlled substances is to avoid the use of
benzodiazepines (such as alprazolam) with opioids (such as oxycodone-acetaminophen).

12. There is an increased potential for respiratory depression with the use of opioids

and benzodiazepines at the same time.

4 It is unknown whether Respondent obtained Patient Reports for Patient A during his care of Patient A in
2018 because those PMP records were not available to Board staff at the time of this investigation.


Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(775) 688-2559

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


13. Respondent prescribed Patient A benzodiazepines on September 16, 2021, when
Respondent knew, or should have known, from Patient A’s Patient Report that Patient A was
being prescribed opioids by another prescribing provider at that same time.

14. ‘It is unknown whether Respondent actually reviewed Patient A’s Patient Report
obtained by Respondent on September 16, 2021, because Respondent made no notes about it or
otherwise referred to it in Patient A’s medical records.

15. Patient A’s medical records do not show that Respondent discussed Patient A’s use
of opioids and benzodiazepines at the same time with Patient A.

16. Patient A’s medical records do not show that Respondent suggested other
medication options for Patient A in order to avoid Patient A from taking both opioids and
benzodiazepines at the same time.

17. Patient A’s use of both opioids and benzodiazepines at the same time put Patient A
at great risk.

18. | Respondent should have talked to Patient A about this risk and documented that
discussion in Patient A’s medical records.

19. Patient A’s medical records do not reflect that Respondent discussed this with him.

20. The standard of care in a situation like this is to convert the patient’s short-acting
benzodiazepine (alprazolam) to a long-acting version, such as diazepam or clonazepam, and then
taper off the use of the benzodiazepine at a rate of no more than 25% each week.

21. The standard of care would also include obtaining and/or attempting to obtain
outside medical records for the patient regarding the patient’s use of the other medications listed
in the patient’s Patient Report from the PMP.

22. Obtaining or attempting to obtain outside medical records for a patient would be
documented in the patient’s medical records.

23. Patient A’s medical records do not show that Respondent obtained or attempted to
obtain outside medical records for Patient A.

24, Respondent’s notes in Patient A’s medical records for September 16, 2021, and

October 15, 2021, are identical in the subjective section and mental status examination section,


OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(775) 688-2559


except for the start/stop times and the note for September 16, 2021, that Patient A was being seen
by telemedicine.°

25. | Upon information and belief, this is evidence that Respondent simply copied
verbiage from previous notes in Patient A’s medical records instead of recording what Patient A
said during that visit in the subjective section and actually completing and/or recording the results
of Patient A’s mental status examination during that visit.

26. Upon information and belief, Respondent copied and pasted progress notes from
visit to visit for Patient A, which led to a failure to maintain clear, legible, accurate, and complete
medical records for Patient A.

27. Patient A’s medical records for September 16, 2021, and October 15, 2021, include
information for vital signs taken from future dates, December 14, 2021, and January 11, 2022.

28. Specifically, for both September 16, 2021, and October 15, 2021, Patient A’s
medical records state “Blood pressure check — Unable to Obtain” on both December 14, 2021, and
January 11, 2022.

29. Upon information and belief, the information in { 27-28 indicates that Patient A’s
medical records for September 16, 2021, and October 15, 2021, were actually created in the future
and then back-dated.

30. It is not appropriate under the standard of care to back-date patient medical records.

31. Back-dated patient records may be deemed as falsified records.

32. Patient A’s medical records for August 16, 2018, include information for vital
signs (blood pressure check) taken from future dates in 2018 (6 future visits documented), 2019
(13 future visits documented), 2020 (4 future visits documented), 2021 (2 future visits
documented), and 2022 (1 future visit documented).

33. Similarly, Patient A’s medical records for August 16, 2018, include “Weight
Control Review” information, including Patient A’s weight in pounds, for future dates in 2018 and

2019.

5 On September 16, 2021, after “Chief Complaint”, Patient A’s medical record says “Today, patient
evaluated via telemedicine/Telehealth.” On October 15, 2021, after “Chief Complaint”, Patient As’ medical records
says “Patient is doing telemed appointment today.”

December 21, 2018, March 14, 2019, May 10, 2019, June 5, 2019, July 3, 2019, and
August 28, 2019.

35. Upon information and belief, the information in J 32-34 indicate that Patient A’s
medical records for August 16, 2018, were actually created in the future and then back-dated.

36. Patient A’s medical records for August 30, 2018, includes information for vital
signs (blood pressure check) taken from future dates in 2018 (5 future visits documented), 2019
(13 future visits documented), 2020 (4 future visits documented), 2021 (2 future visits
documented), and 2022 (1 future visit documented).

50. Upon information and belief, the information in | 48-49 indicate that Patient A’s
medical records for December 21, 2018, were actually created in the future and then back-dated.

51. It is not appropriate under the standard of care to back-date patient medical records.

52.  Back-dated patient records may be deemed as falsified records.

53. Upon information and belief, Respondent’s care of Patient A showed a lack of
diligence in both documentation, review, and management of Patient A’s medications which fell
below the standard of care.

54. It is unethical to pre-date or back-date a patient’s medical record.

55. Alternatively, if Patient A’s medical records were not backdated by Respondent,
they were not saved in a format that could not be altered in the future which would also fall below
the standard of care for maintaining proper medical records.

56. | Respondent also failed to ensure that Patient A’s current medications were
correctly documented in Patient A’s medical records.

57. For this reason, it is difficult to ascertain what medications Patient A was taking
from visit-to-visit and/or what medications were a part of Patient A’s current treatment plan.

58. For example, Patient A’s medical records dated August 18, 2018, list both
alprazolam 2 mg (quantity 60) and 1 mg (quantity 90) as current medications for Patient A.

59. Similarly, Patient A’s medical records dated August 16, 2018, list two strengths
and quantities of doxepin (25 mg and 75 mg) for Patient A as well as three strengths of
lamotrigine (25 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg) three strengths and quantities of quetiapine (50 mg, 200
mg, and 100 mg), and two strengths of venlafaxine (75 mg and 150 mg).

60. Some of the medications shown in Patient A’s current medication list also treat the
same conditions, such as Pristiq and venlafaxine, among others, and it is unclear which of these
medications Patient A is actually taking and/or whether or not the overlap of medications is
intentional.®

61. | The same concerns noted above in § 56-60 regarding Patient A’s medical records
dated August 16, 2018, are also evident in all of the other records for Patient A provided to the
Board’s investigator in connection with this investigation.

62. Specifically, those medical records are dated August 30, 2018,
September 13,2018, October 31, 2018, November 26, 2018, December 21, 2018,
September 16, 2021, and October 15, 2021, and show similar confusion and/or lack of clarity
regarding Patient A’s current medications with regard to both different strengths and quantities as
well as possible overlap due to treating the same conditions with more than one medication.


6 Multiple medications shown in Patient A’s medical records as “current medications” treat both anxiety and
depression, among other conditions. It is unclear what medications are truly current medications and what
medications are no longer being used by Patient A.

63. For controlled substances, another practitioner could use Patient A’s Patient Report
from the PMP to determine what controlled substances Patient A is taking by reviewing his refill
history.

64. However, for non-scheduled medications, another practitioner would likely need to
rely on Patient A’s medical records maintained by Respondent which do not clearly and
accurately lay out his current medications.

Investigation No. 22-21354 Regarding Respondent

63. On April 4, 2022, a Board investigator sent an allegation letter to Respondent along
with an IC Order to Produce Healthcare Records, requesting that Respondent reply to the inquiry
and provide Patient A’s records within thirty (30) calendar days (May 4, 2022).

64. | No response was received from Respondent.

65. On April 11, 2022, a Board investigator sent an allegation letter to Respondent
along with an IC Order to Produce Healthcare Records, requesting that Respondent reply to the
inquiry and provide Patient A’s records within thirty (30) calendar days (May 11, 2022).

66. | No response was received from Respondent.

67. On May 12, 2022, a Board investigator sent a second request for a response to the
allegations and an IC Order to produce Patient A’s records to Respondent, requesting that
Respondent reply to the inquiry and provide Patient A’s records within fifteen (15) calendar days
(May 27, 2022).

68. | No response was received from Respondent.

69. On May 27, 2022, a Board investigator sent a final request for a response to the
allegations and an IC Order to produce Patient A’s records to Respondent, requesting that
Respondent reply to the inquiry and provide Patient A’s records within ten (10) calendar days
(une 6, 2022).

70. Respondent did not send a response to the Board investigator until June 24, 2022.

71. Therefore, based on the allegations contained in { 63-70 Respondent did not timely
respond to the Board in Investigation No, 22-21354.
