COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Sarah A. Bradley, J.D., MBA, Deputy Executive Director and attorney for
the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Chinyere Lawrentia Okeke, M.D., (Respondent)
violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative
Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint,
stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 14416). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on June 19, 2012.

2. Patient A? was a thirty-nine (39) year-old female at the time of the events at issue
in this Complaint.

3. According to Respondent’s letter to a Board investigator dated January 14, 2022,
regarding Patient A, Respondent started seeing Patient A and established her as her patient on or
about March 14, 2019.


! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Chowdhury H. Ahsan,
M.D., Ph.D., FACC, and Col. Eric D, Wade, USAF (Ret.) (Public Member).

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

A. Respondent’s Prescribing of Controlled Substances to Patient A.

4. Respondent prescribed controlled substances to Patient A during the time of the
events at issue in this Complaint.

5. The Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) Patient Report for Patient A shows
that Patient A first received a prescription for a controlled substance (Vyvanse 30 mg capsules)
from Respondent on August 5, 2019.

6. According to Patient A’s Patient Report in the PMP, Respondent did not query
Patient A’s prescription drug history at any time from October 19,2018, through
October 19, 2021.

7. On or about November 15, 2021, Respondent obtained Patient A’s Patient Report
from the PMP for the first time.

8. Respondent did not conduct queries of Patient A in the PMP prior to prescribing
controlled substances to her, or every ninety (90) days after prescribing controlled substances to
her as required by Nevada law.

B. Respondent’s Medical Records for Patient A.

9. From Patient A’s PMP Patient Report, it appears that Respondent saw Patient A
regularly (generally monthly) from August 5, 2019, through July 13, 2021.

10. However, the records provided to the Board investigator regarding Patient A are for
July 15, 2020, August 18, 2020, September 22, 2020, October 20, 2020, February 25, 2021,
April 16, 2021, May 3, 2021, and June 2, 2021.

11. Patient A’s medical records reflect urine analysis testing being done in
Respondent’s office on July 15, 2020, September 22, 2020, and February 25, 2021. However, in
her response to the Board’s investigator on November 15, 2021, Respondent indicated “during
each visit, patient had her urine checked randomly for drug screening.” This statement is not
supported by the medical records provided to the Board for Patient A.

12. Further, in her response to the Board’s investigator on November 15, 2021,
Respondent indicated Patient A’s in-office “toxicology reports were consistent.” Again, this

statement is not supported by the medical records provided to the Board for Patient A.

13. Respondent notes in Patient A’s medical records on February 25, 2021, that
Patient A’s “in office urine toxicology was negative for any controlled substance.” However,
Respondent was prescribing Vyvanse 30 mg capsules to Patient A, with instructions for Patient A
to take one capsule daily by mouth. If Patient A was taking her medications as prescribed, Patient
A’s urine analysis testing on February 25, 2021, should have been positive for a controlled
substance, specifically Vyvanse. Respondent did not document that she asked Patient A about the
urine analysis results or otherwise discussed this issue with Patient A on February 25, 2021.

14. Respondent further did not document the results for urine analysis testing on
July 15, 2020, with regard to Patient A’s use of controlled substances.

15. On August 18, 2020, Patient A had a telemedicine visit with Respondent.
Respondent’s notes in Patient A’s medical records for this visit includes that a physical
examination was performed on Patient A. Specifically, Respondent notes that Patient A’s heart
had “regular, rate and rhythm,” Patient A’s abdomen had “normoactive bowel sounds present” and
“abdomen is soft and nontender to palpation,” among other descriptions indicating that
Respondent physically examined Patient A on that day.

16. | Upon information and belief, the physical examination information included in
Patient A’s medical records for the August 18, 2020, visit, is the same as the information included
in the medical records for Patient A’s July 15, 2020, visit, and appears that Respondent carried the
same information over into the August 18, 2020, medical record.

17. On October 20, 2020, Patient A had a telemedicine visit with Respondent.
Respondent’s notes in Patient A’s medical records for this visit includes that a physical
examination was performed of Patient A. Specifically, Respondent notes that Patient A’s heart
had “regular, rate and rhythm,” Patient A’s abdomen had “normoactive bowel sounds present” and
“abdomen is soft and nontender to palpation,” among other descriptions indicating that
Respondent physically examined Patient A on that day.

18. Upon information and belief, the physical examination information included in
Patient A’s medical records for the October 20, 2020, visit, is the same as the information

included in the medical records for Patient A’s September 22, 2020, visit, and appears that
Respondent carried the same information over into the October 20, 2020, medical record.

19. Patient A’s current medications list should have been updated by Respondent at
each patient visit. For example, multiple medications were listed as “current medications” on
each of the medical records provided to the Board’s investigator for appointments dated
July 15, 2020, August 18, 2020, September 22, 2020, October 20, 2020, February 25, 2021,
April 16, 2021, May 3, 2021, and June 2, 2021.

20. Specifically, amoxicillin 875 mg, 20 qty., and azithromycin 500 mg, 5 qty., are
listed as “current medications” for Patient A at each visit for which the Board investigator
received medical records.

21. It is unlikely that Patient A would be prescribed two different antibiotics to take at
the same time during a one (1) year period.

22. Similarly, Patient A’s medical records from July 15, 2020, August 18, 2020,
September 22, 2020, October 20, 2020, April 16, 2021, May 3, 2021, and June 2, 2021, all include
the following as current medications: (1) metoprolol su-hydrochlorothiazide 50-12.5 mg, quantity
30, (2) metoprolol succinate 50 mg, 30 quantity, (3) metoprolol succinate 100 mg, 90 quantity,
and (4) metoprolol ta-hydrochlorothiazide 50-25 mg, quantity 30.°

23. Upon information and belief, these medications are similar and treat the same
conditions (high blood pressure) and Patient A would not be prescribed all four (4) of these
medications for use at the same time.

24. It is not clear in Patient A’s plan of care in her medical records what her current
treatment medications should be.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice
25. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

reference as though fully set forth herein.

3 Patient A’s medical records for February 25, 2021, include the following as current medications: (1)
metoprolol su-hydrochlorothiazide 50-12.5 mg, quantity 30, (2) metoprolol succinate 100 mg, 90 quantity, and (3)
metoprolol ta-hydrochlorothiazide 50-25 mg, quantity 30. For this record only, metoprolol succinate 50 mg, 30
quantity, is not included as a “current medication” for Patient A.

26. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

27. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

28. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A.

29. Specifically, Respondent prescribed controlled substances to Patient A without
checking Patient A’s Patient Report in the PMP. Because of this Respondent was not aware of all
of the controlled substances that Patient A was taking and did not formulate her plan of care with
these other medications in mind.

30. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

31. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

32. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

33. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document her actions and/or ensure that
Patient A’s current medication list and plan of care was fully updated and accurate when she
treated Patient A, causing Patient A’s medical records not to be timely, legible, accurate, and
complete.

34. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT Ill
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(3) - Violation of Statutes and Regulations of the
Nevada State Board of Pharmacy

35. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

36. | NRS 639.23507 requires that a prescribing practitioner before issuing an initial
prescription for controlled substances listed in schedule II, III, or IV, or an opioid that is a
controlled substance listed in schedule V, and at least once every ninety (90) days thereafter for
the duration of the course of treatment using the controlled substance, obtain a patient utilization
report (Patient Report) regarding the patient from the PMP.

37. Respondent failed to obtain Patient Reports for Patient A as required by
NRS 639.23507.

38. This conduct violates NRS 630.306(1)(b)(3).

39. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against her and give
her notice that she may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
