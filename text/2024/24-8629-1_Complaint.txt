COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Alexander J. Hinman, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that David Michael Ross, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

i. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 6082). Respondent was originally
licensed by the Board on June 9, 1990, and has a specialty in anesthesiology.

2. Patient A? was a sixty-two (62) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. On August 30, 2019, Patient A presented to Smoke Ranch Surgery Center for a T6-
7, and T7-8 TESI (transforaminal epidural steroid injections), a procedure that does not cure back
pain, but can provide pain relief. For the procedure, Respondent provided deep sedation
anesthesia to Patient A while another doctor performed the injections.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Chowdhury H. Ahsan, M.D., Ph.D., FACC,
Ms. Pamela J. Beal, Irwin B. Simon M.D., FACS.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4. The American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) has published a position statement

3 and the concomitant risk

on “Anesthetic Care During Interventional Pain Procedures for Adults
of procedural sedation not only includes the general risks of anesthesia but also the additional risk
of nerve damage, as these procedures are in close proximity to neural and vital structures. The
standard of care requires that a patient be able to give feedback regarding needle placement and
pain and monitoring of level consciousness. During high dose propofol anesthesia or deep
sedation, patient feedback cannot be solicited.

5. Respondent failed to document any medical rationale or necessity for using deep
sedation anesthesia during the procedure.

6. On August 30, 2019, at 11:16 a.m., Patient A was taken to the operating room and
placed on the procedure table. Respondent, without any documented discussion with the doctor
performing the TESI injections, then began administering deep sedation anesthesia. Patient A
ultimately received three (3) successive doses of IV Propofol (100mg each), while the other doctor
performed the TESI procedures on Patient A’s right T6-7 and T7-8 vertebrae.‘

7. The procedure ended at 11:31 a.m., and the anesthesia time noted by Respondent
was fifteen (15) minutes from anesthesia start to finish. Respondent opines that Patient A “must
have awakened to some degree at least twice during the procedure...” otherwise there would have
been no reason to have administered an additional two (2) doses of IV Propofol (100mg).

8. After the procedure, when Patient A regained consciousness, she complained of
pain, numbness, and tingling. The physician that performed the TESI’s, then took Patient A back
to the OR and, for reasons not documented, performed an SI joint injection using conscious
sedation, and then ordered an MRI.


3 “Anesthetic Care During Interventional Pain Procedures for Adults,” states “[e]xamples of procedures that
typically do not require sedation but are not limited to epidural steroid injections, epidural blood patch, trigger point
injections, injections into the shoulder, hip, knee, facet, and sacroiliac joints, and occipital nerve blocks.” (Emphasis
added.)

* Medicare (CMS) guidelines for performing TESI confirms the avoidance of deep sedation or general
anesthesia, stating “[u]se of Moderate or Deep Sedation, General Anesthesia, and Monitored Anesthesia (MAC) is
usually unnecessary, or rarely indicated for these procedures and therefore, not considered medically reasonably and
necessary.” “Even in patients with a needle phobia and anxiety, typically oral anxiolytics suffice. In exceptional and
unique cases, documentation must clearly establish the need for such sedation in the specific patient.”

9. After examining the MRI, Patient A was transferred to Southern Hills Hospital via
ambulance. Patient A was hospitalized for seven (7) days following the procedure and was not
discharged from Southern Hills Hospital until September 5, 2019. From there she was transported
to a rehabilitation hospital.

10. On January 20, 2020, Patient A was seen at the Cleveland Clinic and was
diagnosed with iatrogenic cervicothoracic syrinx formation, which was caused by the August 30,
2019, procedure. Further providers at the Cleavland Clinic diagnosed Patient A with Central Pain
Syndrome that included leg and arm weakness and difficulty walking.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

11. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

12. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

13. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

14. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, when Respondent used deep sedation and/or general
anesthesia for the thoracic transforaminal injections performed on August 30, 2019, thus
prohibiting Patient A from providing real-time feedback in regard to needle placement, and pain.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT It
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

17. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

18. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions when he treated
Patient A, by, among other things, not documenting any medical rationale or medical necessity for
using anesthesia during the procedure. Thus, Respondent’s medical records were not timely,
legible, accurate, and complete.

19. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
