10 COMPLAINT
" The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),

12 |] by and through Donald K. White, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
13 || reasonable basis to believe that Kevin Corbridge Hyer, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of|
14 |] Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
15 || (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and
16 |] allegations as follows:

7 1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
18 || active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No, 5979). Respondent was
19 || originally licensed by the Board on December 2, 1989.

20 2. Patient A? was a seventy (70) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

ai 3. On October 10, 2017, Patient A underwent a yearly preventative mammogram test
22 |] which was read and interpreted by Respondent in Las Vegas, Nevada

appearing left breast calcifications are seen.” The reading was that of BIRAD two (2). benign
findings.

5. Itwas determined later that Patient A, did in fact have changes to the breast tissue at
that time that had been developing over time. When tests from 2014, 2015, and 2016 were reviewed
and compared with the test from October 10, 2017, the changes were progressive, prominent,
asymmetric and should have been reported as floridly abnormal. ‘There was skin retraction,
progressive reduction in right breast size, progressive asymmetric increased density, progressive
increase in size of the spiculated architectural distortion in the ten o’clock posterior third of the right
breast, and progressive increase in grouped fine rod-like calcifications evident on the examination
of October 10, 2017. The test should have been converted from a screening diagnostic exam to a
diagnostic exam or should have been coded as BIRAD zero (0): incomplete and recommendations
made for completion of a diagnostic examination.

6. Over time, there was progressive change in the regional/global asymmetric density
and a progressive volume loss of the right breast.

COUNT
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

7. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

8. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

9. NAC 630,040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances ”

10, As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, because Respondent compared images from 2014, 2015,
and 2016, with an image from October 10, 2017, and Respondent should have acknowledged that
the changes were progressive, prominent, asymmetric and should have been reported as floridly

abnormal The results of the test should have been converted from a preventative screening exam
