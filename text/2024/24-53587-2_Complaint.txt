4. While under care of this provider, on October 15, 2021, Patient A was prescribed |
mg of Alprazolam twice per day for thirty (30) days. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine and is listed
as a Schedule IV controlled substance.

5. On November 16, 2021, Patient A presented to Respondent for psychiatric care
following Patient A’s transfer from another provider in the Respondent’s practice. During the
November 16, 2021, visit, Respondent failed to run a PMP for Patient A prior to continuing the
prescription for his of 1 mg of Alprazolam twice per day for thirty (30) days. Additionally,
Respondent’s notes for Patient A at this visit contained an identical subjective mental status exam
from Patient A’s previous encounter with the previous physician, indicating that Patient A’s
medical record for this visit was cloned form his prior visit at the facility.

6. Respondent continued to see Patient A for an additional six (6) visits over a period
of six (6) months and continued to provide refills of the Alprazolam 1 mg. During these visits,
Respondent failed to run a single PMP report on Patient A for the duration of his treatment.

7. PMP data showed Patient A was concurrently being prescribed opioids during his
treatment with Respondent which is contraindicated. Respondent failed to address Patient A's
opioid use in his medical records, taper down Patient A’s benzodiazepine usage, or switch
Patient A to a longer acting medication such as clonazepam. Respondent's notes during the
remainder of Patient A’s visits continued to be highly templated and contained identical subjective
and mental status exams which included repeated spelling errors, all of which indicate the records
were cloned.

8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

reference as though fully set forth herein.
