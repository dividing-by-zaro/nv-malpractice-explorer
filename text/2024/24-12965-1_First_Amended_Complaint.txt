The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Francis Escolin Jimenez, M.D., (Respondent)

Complaint (Complaint), stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 9268). Respondent was originally
licensed by the Board on January 7, 2000, specializing in Family Practice.

3. On or around May 15, 2018, Patient A presented to Respondent for a sexually
transmitted disease (“STD”) examination, after being informed that a previous sexual partner had
contracted an STD. Additionally, Patient A sought a refill for his existing prescriptions of
Adderall and Vyvanse.

Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Aury Nagy, M.D., and

4. Prior to seeing Respondent in a doctor-patient capacity, Patient A knew
Respondent through the course of his employment, as Patient A was a pharmaceutical
representative for AstraZeneca and had made multiple visits to Respondent’s medical practice.

5. Patient A and Respondent developed a professional relationship; however, this
relationship became atypical when Respondent began making inappropriate comments and
behaving unprofessionally towards Patient A. This commentary and behavior occurred before,
during, and after the May 15, 2018, examination.

6. At the May 15, 2018, examination Respondent performed a physical inspection of
Patient A’s genitals for approximately five (5) to seven (7) minutes. During the examination,
Respondent told Patient A that he wanted to put Patient A’s penis in his mouth, that he had a
“really nice penis,” and that he should be getting erect while Respondent was performing the
examination.

7. There are no medical records of Respondent examining Patient A on
May 15, 2018; however, Respondent does not dispute it was performed. Further, there is no
investigation or work-up of a possible STD, and no tests were performed to determine if
Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, or HIV were present.

8. On February 26, 2019, a criminal complaint was filed, with charges stemming from
an incident between Respondent and Patient A. The criminal complaint contained four (4) felony
charges; however, the case resolved when Respondent entered a plea of Nolo Contendere to a
misdemeanor assault charge, and a Judgement was entered September 24, 2020.

initiating disciplinary action against a physician.

19. Respondent’s behavior in telling Patient A that he wanted to put Patient A’s penis
