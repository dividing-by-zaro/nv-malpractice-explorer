ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION & NOTICE OF HEARING

Prior to the preparation of this Order of Summary Suspension, Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners (Board) staff presented evidence and information to an Investigative
Committee (IC) of the Board, composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D.,
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., regarding Binh M. Chung,
M.D. (Dr. Chung). Upon review of the evidence and information presented by Board staff, which
is contained in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) police report filed by the
alleged minor female victim, the Memorandum of Detective Sean Taylor', and the Affidavit of
Detective Sean Taylor’, the IC hereby IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDS Dr. Chung’s license to
practice medicine in the state of Nevada pursuant to Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) 630.326(1),
based upon the following preliminary findings:

1. Dr. Chung is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
(License No. 11281). He was originally licensed by the Board on January 3, 2005.

2. Dr. Chung currently practices medicine at 8785 W. Warm Springs Road, Ste. 109,

in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1 The Memorandum is not disclosed in this Order to protect the identity of the alleged minor female victim but was

contemporaneously served on Dr. Chung with this Order
2 The Affidavit is not disclosed in this Order to protect the identity of the alleged minor female victim but was

contemporaneously served on Dr. Chung with this Order



3. On June 15, 2015, a minor female filed a police report with LVMPD. Per the
police report, the minor female stated she went to see Dr. Chung at his medical office for an acne
problem. Dr. Chung injected the minor female with a medication that caused her to become
groggy. As the minor female was phasing in and out of consciousness, she realized her legs were
propped up and her pants were off. Fearing that something was happening to her, the minor
female began to cry. At this point, Dr. Chung came between the legs of the minor female and
began to abuse her. The minor female immediately passed out. When the minor female awoke,
Dr. Chung took her home. After the minor female was at home she awoke around three o’clock in
the morning knowing that something was very wrong.

4. The police report also asserts that the wife of Dr. Chung found records and text
messages/pictures from Dr. Chung’s personal computer of other women whom he has assaulted.

5. On June 20, 2015, Dr. Chung was arrested and booked on one Class A felony count
of using or permitting the use of a minor, age 14 or older, in the production of pornography or as a
subject to produce porn, a violation of NRS 200.710 and NRS 200.750, and 10 Class A felony
counts of possession of visual pornography of a person under age 16, 10 violations of NRS
200.730.

6. On June 22, 2015, the Board received a Memorandum from Detective Sean Taylor
of the LVMPD Sex Crimes Detail. The Memorandum detailed that several search warrants were
obtained and served on Dr. Chung between June 4, 2015 and June 20, 2015. These search
warrants resulted in the following items being seized from Dr. Chung’s residence and/or medical
practice: Ketamine and computers, hard drives and/or storage devices containing hundreds of
child pornography videos.

7. Based on the foregoing, the IC reasonably determines and believes that the health,
safety and welfare of the public is at imminent risk and that a summary suspension of
Dr. Chung’s license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada is necessary to remove the risk of| |
imminent harm to the health, safety and welfare of the public.
