COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), composed at the time of filing of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Valerie J. Clark, BSN,
RHU, LUTCF, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., by and through Erin L. Albright, Esq., General
Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Arnold W. Klein, MD.
(Respondent), violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada
Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues
its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 11881), and has been
licensed by the Board since June 10, 2006, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice Act.

2. At the times alleged herein, Respondent was also licensed to practice medicine in
the state of California.

3. On or about July 19, 2012, the Medical Board of California filed an Accusation
against Respondent alleging one count of failure to comply with an order to undergo a mental and
physical examination and one count of unprofessional conduct.

4, On or about October 17, 2013, Respondent submitted a reinstatement application to
the Board. On this application, Respondent answered “no” to reinstatement Question #11, which

reads: “Have you been: a) asked to respond to an investigation; b) notified that you were under

investigation for; c) investigated for; d) charged with; or e) convicted of any violation of a statute,
rule or regulation governing your practice as a physician by any medical licensing board, hospital,
medical society, governmental entity or other agency other than the Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners?”

5. Since the Medical Board of California filed an Accusation against Respondent on
or about July 19, 2012, Respondent should have answered “yes” to reinstatement Question #11 on
his application.

6. NRS 630.304(1) provides that obtaining, maintaining or renewing or attempting to
obtain, maintain or renew a license to practice medicine by bribery, fraud or misrepresentation or
by any false, misleading, inaccurate or incomplete statement is grounds for initiating discipline

against a licensee.

£6.

7. Since Respondent answered “no” to reinstatement Question #11 on his
reinstatement application, Respondent was attempting to obtain, maintain or renew his Nevada
medical license by bribery, fraud or misrepresentation or by any false, misleading, inaccurate or
incomplete statement.

8. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an
Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine the sanctions it will impose if it finds Respondent
violated the Medical Practice Act;

4. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent, in writing, its findings of

fact, conclusions of law and order, which shall include the sanctions imposed; and
