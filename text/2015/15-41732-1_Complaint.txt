.BEFORE THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS

OF THE STATE OF NEVADA

In the Matter of Charges and Case No. 15-41732-1

Complaint Against

Douglas Stewart Lynch, PA-C, FI LE D
Respondent. MAY - § 2015

1 ——
COMPLAINT “

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Douglas Stewart Lynch (Respondent), a
licensed physician assistant in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a reasonable basis
to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) chapter
630 and the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) chapter 630 (collectively Medical Practice Act).
The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent applied for a physician assistant license in Nevada. Respondent
disclosed in his application that he had voluntarily entered into a five-year contract with Dr. Peter
Mansky and Nevada Professionals Assistance Program (NPAP) in February 2013 due to prior illicit
drug use. On or about December 30, 2013, Respondent was granted a license (license no. PA1486).

2. Pursuant to its contract with Respondent, NPAP was authorized to notify the Board
of any issues that may affect Respondent’s ability to safely practice medicine in Nevada.

3. On March 18, 2015, the Board received a notice from NPAP that NPAP could not
advocate that Respondent was safe to practice medicine because Respondent had tested positive for

methamphetamine use on February 11, 2015, February 23, 2015, and March 12, 2015. According to

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners is composed of Board members
Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman, Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D.,
Member.

the notice, NPAP believed that Respondent was still actively using methamphetamines due to
increasing levels of methamphetamines in Respondent’s test results. Respondent was deactivated as
a participant in NPAP as of March 16, 2015, because Respondent failed to comply with a corrective
action plan and failed to respond to NPAP’s inquiries.

4. On March 19, 2015, the IC issued an Order of Summary Suspension and Notice of
Hearing (Order) based on the IC’s preliminary determination from its investigative findings that
Respondent’s acts put the health, safety, or welfare of the public at risk of imminent harm. The
Board personally served Respondent with the Order on March 19, 2015. The Order required
Respondent to notify his current supervising physicians that his license has been suspended until
further order of the IC or Board. The Order also provided Respondent with notice that a hearing in
the matter was set for May 4, 2015, at 9:30 a.m.

5. On March 19, 2015, shortly after the Board personally served Respondent with the
Order, Respondent emailed the Board that Respondent had recently relapsed and was no longer
compliant with NPAP criteria. Respondent explained that he has initiated steps for necessary
treatment, as directed by NPAP, that he has notified hospitals and all of his privileges have been
suspended, and that he has been terminated from employment. Respondent indicated that he has no
patient contact at this time, and is not writing prescriptions. Respondent stated that he will complete
the treatment plan, as directed by NPAP. Respondent forwarded notices indicating that Respondent
and his supervising physicians terminated their supervising and/or collaborating agreement.

6. On April 8, 2015, the Board learned that Respondent was attending the Intensive
Outpatient (IOP) treatment. However, Respondent tested positive for methamphetamine use on
April 1, 2015.

7. On April 9, 2015, the Board was notified that Respondent again tested positive for
methamphetamine use on April 6, 2015. As a result, Respondent was discharged from the IOP
treatment with a recommendation that Respondent needs a higher level of care.

8. In April 2015, the Board received letters from Respondent’s supervising physicians
speaking to Respondent’s behavior and practice of medicine as a physician assistant.

9. The week of April 22, 2015, the parties stipulated to continuing the hearing to give

the parties an opportunity to resolve this matter without a hearing. Respondent understood and
agreed that his license would remain in a suspended status for an indefinite period pending
resolution of this matter.

10. On or about April 26, 2015, Respondent entered in-patient treatment for an unknown |"
period of time. Respondent would not be able to communicate with anyone outside of the in-patient
treatment facility until he was released from the program.

Based on the foregoing, the IC charges Respondent with the following violations of the
Medical Practice Act:

Count I

11. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

12. The Board may initiate disciplinary action when it finds a licensee is unable to
practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety because of the use of drugs. NRS 630.306(1).

13. Based on the foregoing factual allegations, Respondent is unable to practice
medicine with reasonable skill and competency because he has tested positive for
methamphetamine use on five separate occasions. Further, the results of the drug testing suggest
that Respondent is still using methamphetamines due to increasing levels of methamphetamines in
Respondent’s test results.

14. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NAC 630.410.

Count I

15. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

engaging in any conduct that the Board has determined is a violation of the standards of practice
established by regulation. NRS 630.306(2).

17. In Nevada, a person who is licensed as a physician assistant is prohibited from

rendering professional services to a patient while the physician assistant is in any impaired mental

or physical condition. NAC 630.230(1)(c).

18. Based on the foregoing factual allegations, the Board cannot permit Respondent to
continue the practice of medicine until Respondent has shown that he no longer poses a threat or
danger to the public.

19. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NAC 630.410.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

20. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

21. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

there has been a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

23. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, to include sanctions to be imposed; and

24. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these
premises.
