3. Patient A was admitted to St. Mary’s Hospital on September 9, 2010, with
diverticular disease complicated by the development of an abscess adjacent to the affected
sigmoid colon.

4. On September 10, 2010, Respondent discussed the various treatment options with

Patient A. After this discussion, Patient A agreed to undergo a colorectal anastomosis.

5. On September 13, 2010, Respondent performed a colorectal anastomosis on
Patient A.
6. Post operatively, Patient A began passing green enteric fluid from her vagina.

7. On September 24, 2010, a different physician performed an exploratory
laparotomy. During this subsequent surgery, it was discovered that the physician assistant who
assisted Respondent placed the circular staple device in Patient A’s vagina instead of the rectum,
leading to a direct colovaginal anastomosis instead of a colorectal anastomosis.

8. Respondent’s failure to recognize the fact that the physician assistant’s placement
of the staple device was incorrect prior to stapling the anastomosis constitutes malpractice.

COUNT I
(Malpractice)

9. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

10. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

11. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

12. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he failed to recognize the fact that the physician assistant placed the staple device in the wrong
location prior to stapling the anastomosis.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
