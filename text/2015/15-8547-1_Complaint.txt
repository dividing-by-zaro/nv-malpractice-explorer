and Willfully Conspiring, Confederating and Agreeing with Others to Commit the Crime of
Adulteration, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Sections 331i(k), 333(a)(2) and
351(a)(2)(A), and one count of Knowingly and Willfully Making and/or Causing to be Made a

THE GRAND JURY CHARGES THAT:

At all times relevant:

Introduction

i. Beginning on or about December 20, 2010, and continuing to in and around March
2011, the defendant, Michael Stanley Kaplan, MD (“Kaplan”), a physcian, re-used needle guides
during invasive prostate procedures. To enrich himself, defendant Kaplan ignored product use
specifications and placed his patients at significant risk by re-using needle guides designed for one
use each,

2. A prostate needle biopsy is a surgical procedure in which a small sample of

tissue is removed from the prostate gland and examined for disease. The procedure is performed in

conjunction with a transrectal ultrasound. A transducer, or probe, enters the rectal cavity and

transmits sound waves. The return echoes are recorded, which enables the physician performing
the procedure to “see” where the biopsy needles are being placed into the prostate.

3. A long, hollow needle is injected through the rectal wall, into the prostate,

from which it removes tissue for analysis. The needle guide serves to stabilize the needle during the
entire course of the biopsy and sits right up against the wall of the rectum.

4, When the biopsy is performed, both the inside and outside of the needle are
contaminated with debris, such as human tissue, blood, bacteria and viruses. As the needle is pulled
back into the channel of the needle guide, it brings the debris with it.

5. Needle guides can be single- or multi-use. Multi-use needle guides are made

of a sturdy material, such as stainless steel, and are disinfected before each use. There is no limit on
the amount of times a multi-use needle guide can be re-used.

6. Single-use needle guides are similar to multi-use needle guides, except they are made
of plastic or other disposable material and are intended to be used for one procedure only. Single
use needle guides made of plastic are prone to scratching by the needle it houses. These scratches
create nooks and crannies on the inner plastic surface of the needle guide in which debris can get
trapped,

7. Civco Medical Solutions (“Civco”) manufactures and distributes single-use needle
guides which are made of plastic. Among other warnings contained in the packaging of Civco’s
single-use needle guides, each individually wrapped needle guide has the number “2” inside of a
circle with a line through it, denoting that it should not be used more than once.

8. The Food and Drug Administration “FDA") regulates medical devices. The
federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") defines a medical device, in pertinent part, as an
instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar
or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is intended for use in the

diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, treatment, or prevention of a disease, in

© man or in animals, or intended to affect the structure or any fiction of the body of man or other

animals. 21 U.S.C. §321(h). A needle guide was a medical device.

9. Under the FDCA, a device was adulterated if it was prepared, packed, or held

under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been contaminated with filth, or whereby it may
have been rendered injurious to health. 21 U.S.C. ¢ 351(a)(@)(A).

10. The FDCA made it unlawful to do any act or cause any act to be done with respect to
a device while the device was held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce, if such act
resulted in the device being adulterated. 21 U.S.C. §331(k). Such conduct is a felony when
performed with the intent to defraud or mislead. 21 U.S.C. § 333(a\(2).

li. Defendant Kaplan was a urologist licensed to practice medicine in the State

of Nevada. He operated a medical practice known as Green Valley Urology (“GVU"). GVU has
two separate offices, one on Sunset Way in Henderson, NV, at which defendant Kaplan practiced,

and one on West Arby Street in Las Vegas, NV, at which another physician(s) worked. In the

. course of his practice, defendant Kaplan performed prostate needle biopsies and other procedures

, requiring needle guides.

(Title 18, United States Code, Section 371)

12. The Grand Jury further charges and incorporates by reference the allegations of

| paragraphs | through 11 above, as though fully set forth herein.

13. From on or about December 20, 2010 and continuing through in or about May 2011,

| jn the State and federal District of Nevada,

Michael Stanley Kaplan, M.D.,

defendant herein, knowingly and willfully conspired, confederated, and agreed with others known
' and unknown to the Grand Jury, to commit the crime of Adulteration, in violation of Title 21,

: United States Code, Sections 331(k), 333(a)(2) and 351(a)(2)(A).

Case 2:13-cr-00.. )-GMN-GWF Document 1 Filed 1. bing Page 4 of 8

; The Object of the Conspiracy
| 14, The object of the conspiracy was to re-use needle guides which were
3)
| intended for single use for the purpose of enriching the defendant and to re-use them in a manner that
caused them to become adulterated and rendered injurious to health, in violation of Title 21, United
6;
States Code, Sections 331k), 333(a)(2) and 351(a)(2)(A).
Manner and Means of the Conspiracy
8 i
15. Beginning on or about December 20, 2010 and continuing to in or about March
2011, defendant Kaplan obtained through interstate commerce, and thereafter used at GVU,
10.
" adulterated needle guides.
lly
2 16. It was part of the conspiracy that defendant Kaplan re-used and directed, and
12)
authorized and tolerated the medical staff at GVU to re-use single-use needle guides multiple times
prior to disposal. As a result of this re-use, the needle guides were held under insanitary
‘| conditions that rendered them injurious to the health of his patients undergoing procedures
15:
requiring a needle guide.
16;
Overt Acts
17! . . .
e177. In furtherance of the conspiracy, defendant Kaplan committed the following overt
. acts, among others:
19°
A. On or about December 9, 2010, defendant Kaplan purchased or caused to be
20.
purchased a refurbished ultrasound machine from an Ohio company known as Providian Medical
a1 :
| Equipment (“Providian”) when his existing machine broke. It arrived at GVU one or two days later.
, Although Kaplan ordered a stainless steel needle guide to use with the Providian ultrasound, the
23)
i needle guide that arrived was not the appropriate one for that machine.
B. On or about December 15, 2010, Providian caused CIVCO to send one box of
twenty-four (24) plastic, single-use needle guides, via overnight mail, to GVU. Because of the

nN


Case 2:13-cr-00: )-GMN-GWE Document 1 Filed iv ‘brs Page 5 of 6

broken machine and, subsequently, the lack of an appropriate needle guide, GVU did not perform
any procedures requiring the use of a needle guide for approximately one week in the middle of :
December 2010.
| c. When the supply of plastic, single-use needle guides began to run low at

GVU, defendant Kaplan instructed his medical staff, or caused them to be instructed, to re-use the
plastic, single-use needle guides on multiple patients. Defendant Kaplan instructed his medical
staff, or caused them to be instructed, to use each plastic, single-use needle guide three (3) to five (5)
times prior to disposal.

D. Between on or about December 15, 2010 and on or about March 11, 2011,
defendant Kaplan performed approximately 120 procedures requiring a needle guide.

E, Between on or about December 15, 2010 and on or about March 11, 2011,
defendant Kaplan used approximately less than 10 needle guides for the 120 procedures he
performed.

F. Between on or about December 15, 2010 and on or about March 11, 2011,
Kaplan concealed, and caused to be concealed from his patients, that they were undergoing
procedures with re-used needle guides.

G. On or about March 11, 2011, defendant Kaplan made false representations to
federal investigators regarding the duration of his re-use of needle guides to conceal his lengthy and
unsafe re-use of needle guides.

H. On or about March 23, 2011, defendant Kaplan took out a paid
advertisement in the Las Vegas Review-Journal newspaper containing false representations
regarding the duration of his re-use of the single use needle guides and the efforts he and his medical
staff purportedly took to disinfect re-used needle guides in an effort to conceal his lengthy and
unsafe re-use of needle guides.

I, In or about April 2011 and May 2011, defendant Kaplan made false

representations to the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, pursuant to inquiries from that


Case 2:13-cr-00 °)-GMN-GWE Document 1 Filed 1, “yng Page 6 of 6


/ Board, regarding the duration of his re-use of the single use needle guides and the efforts he and his

_ medical staff purportedly took to disinfect re-used needle guides in order to conceal his lengthy and
| unsafe re-use of needle guides.
Count Two
4 (False Statement to a Government Agency)
6 18, On or about March 11, 2011, in the State and Federal District of Nevada,
Michael Stanley Kaplan, M.D.,
9 | defendant herein, did knowingly and willfully make and cause to be made a materially false,
10 fictitious, and fraudulent statement and representation in a matter within the jurisdiction of a
11 , federal agency, the Food and Drug Administration - Office of Criminal Investigations; that is, |
12,, during an interview, defendant Kaplan told investigators that re-use of single use needle guides at

13 : GVU stopped in February 2011. That statement and representation was false because, as defendant

| Kaplan then and there knew, re-use continued at the GVU practice into March 2011. Indeed,

15,
defendant Kaplan did not instruct his medical staff to stop re-using single use needle guides until

17 | his medical license was summarily suspended by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners on
18 | March 14, 2011; all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001.
