FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(Board), composed at the time of filing of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Valerie J. Clark, BSN,
RHU, LUTCF, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., by and through Erin L. Albright, Esq., General
Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a reasonabic basis to believe that Susan L. Boyd, M.D.
(Respondent), violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada
Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues
its First Amended Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent has been licensed by the Board since August 23, 1996 (License No.
7944), pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice Act, and is currently licensed in active
status.

2. Patient A was a thirty-six (36)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed in this First Amended Complaint to protect her
identity, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation contemporaneously served on
Respondent with the original Complaint.

3. On or about June 16, 2010, Patient A presented to Respondent with complaints of

pain from her IUD and a history of a large cystocele and rectocele causing incontinence of urine

and difficulty evacuating bowels. The patient’s medical records from this visit fail to document
the physical findings of the pelvic exam.

4, On or about November 30, 2010, Patient A underwent a surgical total vaginal
hysterectomy, which was performed by Respondent.

5. Patient A’s medical chart lacks documentation demonstrating that the patient was
seen preoperatively, that Respondent discussed the proposed surgery with the patient, that
Respondent proposed alternatives to surgery, that the physical findings supported the performance
of a total vaginal hysterectomy, that Respondent performed an adequate evaluation of patient’s
disease and that patient gave her informed consent to the surgery.

6. Respondent failed to document in Patient A’s medical records preoperative pelvic
findings that would support the indication or medical need for the vaginal hysterectomy and
anterior posterior repair performed on Patient A on November 30, 2010.

7. On or about December 20, 2010, Patient A presented to Respondent for a
postoperative examination with complaints of increased pain after the hysterectomy and a foul
smelling discharge from her vagina. Respondent performed a physical examination on Patient A
and noted the presence of feces in her vaginal cuff and an opening extending from Patient A’s
rectum into her vagina. Respondent scheduled Patient A for a diagnostic laparoscopy and
examination under anesthesia.

8. On or about December 23, 2010, Patient A presented to the Las Vegas Surgery
Center for the diagnostic laparoscopy and examination under anesthesia, which was performed by
Respondent. Respondent examined Patient A and noted the vaginal area contained a recto-vaginal
fistula with inflammation.

9. Patient A’s medical chart lacks any documentation demonstrating that Respondent
performed a laparoscopic evaluation of Patient A or obtained Patient A’s consent prior to
performing the diagnostic laparoscopy on December 23, 2010.

10. Treatment of a recto-vaginal fistula, regardless of etiology, requires measures to
decrease inflammation and to let the tissues surrounding the recto-vaginal fistula to fully heal

before attempting repair. This is necessary so the true extent of tissue damage can be ascertained.

The measures generally employed to decrease inflammation include antibiotics and observation
for at least six (6) to eight (8) weeks.

11. Despite noting the existence of inflammation surrounding Patient A’s recto-vaginal
fistula, Respondent proceeded to surgically close the recto-vaginal fistula with chromic and
Monocryl sutures in a layered fashion. Respondent noted in Patient A’s chart that it was “doubtful
that this will maintain integrity due to the inflammation of the tissues.”

12. On or about December 30, 2010, Patient A underwent a laparoscopic loop
ileostomy performed by another surgeon. A laparoscopic loop ileostomy was performed due to
the inflamed vaginal tissue, thus allowing the tissue to heal before repairing the recto-vaginal
fistula.

13. Respondent dictated two (2) separate operative reports for the November 30, 2010
procedure. The first operative report was dictated by Respondent on March 14, 2011. The second
operative report was dictated by Respondent on March 19, 2011. These reports contain significant
differences in the description of Patient A’s November 30, 2010 surgery, including, but not
limited to the following: The March 14, 2011 dictation states that Patient A’s bladder was not
emptied nor was a speculum initially placed. The March 19, 2011 dictation states that Patient A’s
bladder was straight catherized and a speculum placed. The March 14, 2011 dictation states that
the repair of Patient A’s rectocoele ended two (2) centimeters below her vaginal cuff. The March
19, 2011 dictation notes that the posterior repair was carried up Patient A’s vaginal cuff. The
March 14, 2011 dictation does not describe a vaginal pack being placed at the end of surgery. The
March 19, 2011 dictation describes a vaginal pack with Premarin being placed at the end of
surgery. The March 14, 2011 dictation documents the preoperative diagnosis of “severe
dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain.” The March 19, 2011 dictation does not include these
diagnoses.
