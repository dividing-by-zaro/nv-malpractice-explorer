Sheldon Paul, M.D., AUG 31 2015
Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF.
MEDICAL EXABINERS =
COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Sheldon Paul, M.D. (Respondent), a
licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a reasonable basis to
believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) chapter 630 and
Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) chapter 630 (collectively Medical Practice Act). The IC
alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in Nevada in active status (license no. 9007), and has
been so licensed by the Board since July 1, 1999.

2. Patient A was 37 weeks pregnant at the onset of the incidents in question. Her true
identity is not disclosed in any public document to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed
to Respondent in the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this
Complaint.

3. On or about July 19, 2010, Patient A presented to Respondent for a Cesarean section.
Patient A had requested a tubal ligation during the Cesarean section for future pregnancy
prevention. The informed consent form, which was signed by both Patient A and Respondent on

July 19, 2010, identifies the authorized procedure to be a “Repeat cesarean section with bilateral

' The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) was composed of Board
members Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman, Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and
Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member at the time the IC voted to file this Complaint. As of July 8, 2015, Ms. Clark is no
longer a member of the IC or Board.

tubal ligation.”

4, In February 2011, Patient A took a pregnancy test, which returned positive. Patient A
presented to Respondent, who explained that bilateral tubal ligations can fail. Thereafter,
Patient A never returned to Respondent.

5. Patient A visited her Patient Advocate, and discovered that the tubal ligation was never
performed. It was later confirmed by a subsequent health care provider on physical inspection
during Patient A’s fourth Cesarean section that the tubal ligation was never performed.

6. Respondent stated that he performed the Cesarean section and that he believes he
performed the tubal ligation. Respondent acknowledges that the medical records reflect consent
to the tubal ligation, but that there is no evidence that the tubal ligation was actually performed—
neither he nor the nurses noted anything regarding a tubal ligation in the medical records.

7. Malpractice is grounds for the Board to initiate disciplinary action against a licensee in
Nevada. NRS 630.301(4).

8. “‘Malpractice’ means the failure of a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable
care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.” NAC 630.040.

9. Based on the facts, Respondent committed malpractice by not performing a procedure he
agreed to perform.

10. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as provided in
NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays that the Board:

1. Give Respondent notice of the charges set forth in this Complaint;

2. Give Respondent notice that Respondent may file an answer to the Complaint as set forth
in NRS 630.339(2) within 20 days of service of the Complaint;

3.Set a time and = place for a formal hearing § after holding an
Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

4. Determine the sanctions it will impose if it finds Respondent violated the Medical Practice
Act;

5. Make, issue, and serve on Respondent, in writing, its findings of fact, conclusions of law
