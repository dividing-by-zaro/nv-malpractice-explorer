female with a medication that caused her to become groggy. As the minor female was phasing in
and out of consciousness, she realized her legs were propped up in stirrups and her pants were off.
Fearing that something was happening to her, the minor female began to cry. At this point,
Respondent came between the legs of the minor female and began to abuse her. The minor female
immediately passed out. The minor female also remembered another time during this encounter
when she awoke and vomited. Ultimately, Respondent revived the minor female and informed
her that she had a bad reaction to the acne treatment. Respondent also asked the minor female to
remain silent about the alleged bad reaction she had to the acne treatment. Subsequently,
Respondent took the minor female home. At this time, the minor female knew something was
very wrong.

Respondent’s personal computer and/or flash drive that showed Respondent, in his medical office,
having sex with women who appeared to be unresponsive.

5. ~ Between June 4, 2015 and June 20, 2015, detectives for LVMP served several
search warrants on Respondent. These search warrants resulted in the following items being
seized from Respondent’s residence and/or medical practice: Ketamine computers/electronics,
hard drives and/or storage devices containing hundreds of pornography videos, and at least 10
child pornography videos.

6. On June 20, 2015, Respondent was arrested and booked on one Class A felony
count of using or permitting the use of a minor, age 14 or older, in the production of pornography

200.730.
