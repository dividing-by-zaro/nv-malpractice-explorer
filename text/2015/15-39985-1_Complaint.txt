licensed by the Board since September 13, 2012.

states of California, Colorado, Utah, and Washington.

against Respondent for violations of Colorado law. The Final Order affirmed administrative
findings that Respondent violated Colorado laws by failing to meet the necessary standard of care
in issuing medical marijuana certificates, by failing to maintain adequate medical records, and by

failing to establish proper physician-patient relationships as required by medical marijuana laws.
