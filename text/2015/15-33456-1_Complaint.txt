COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Erin L. Albright, Esq., Board General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Lisa M. Cohen, M.D. (Respondent), has violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its formal Complaint,
stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 12977), and has been
licensed by the Board since December 12, 2008, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice
Act.

2. On May 30, 2010, Respondent was arrested by the Chilmark Police Department in
Massachusetts for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, negligent
operation of a motor vehicle, and failure to stay within the marked travel lanes. (See a true and

3. On June 1, 2010, the State of Massachusetts filed a criminal complaint against
Respondent for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, negligent
operation of a motor vehicle, and failure to stay within the marked travel lanes. Id.

4. On June 28, 2010, a judge found sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt
against Respondent for the negligent operation of a motor vehicle but deferred prosecution of the
matter subject to terms and conditions that were to be completed by Respondent. Id. The court
placed Respondent on probation to ensure she complied with the terms and conditions of the
deferred prosecution.

5. On December 30, 2011, after successful completion of the terms and conditions of
the deferred prosecution by Respondent, the court terminated Respondent’s probation. Id.

6. On May 20, 2011, Respondent filed a physician renewal application with the
Board.

7. Question 6 of the 2011 physician renewal application states:

Have you been arrested, investigated for, charged with, convicted of, or pled
guilty or nolo contendere to any offense or violation of any federal (including

the Uniform Code of Military Justice), state or local law, or the laws of any
foreign country, which is a misdemeanor, gross misdemeanor, felony, violation
of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or synonymous thereto in a foreign
jurisdiction, excluding any minor traffic offense (driving or being in control of a
motor vehicle while under the influence of a chemical substance, including
alcohol, is not considered a minor traffic offense), or for any offense which is
related to the manufacture, distribution, prescribing, or dispensing of controlled
substances? Please note that you MUST disclose ANY investigation or arrest,
including those where the final disposition was dismissal, or expungement.

8. Respondent answered Question 6 in the negative. (See a true and correct copy of
Respondent’s answer to Question 6 on her May 20, 2011 physician renewal application, attached
hereto as Exhibit “2.”) Respondent should have responded to Question 6 in the affirmative.

9. Respondent did not notify the Board in writing of her criminal | action in
Massachusetts until February 26, 2015. Respondent provided this notification to the Board
because the Board of Registration in Medicine for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ordered

her to notify the Board. (See a true and correct copy of the Consent Order from the Board of
