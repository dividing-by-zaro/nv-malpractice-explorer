FINDINGS OF FACT
I.

Dr. Seldon is currently licensed in active status, and was so licensed by the Nevada
State Board of Medical Examiners, hereinafter referred to as “the Board,” on February 2, 1995
(License No. 7343), pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised
Statutes, and at all times addressed herein was so licensed.

II.
The Board’s records show that Dr. Seldon’s specialty is otolaryngology.
UII.

Dr. Seldon, in conjunction with his wife Deborah Martinez Seldon, operates a medical
practice called “A New You Medical Aesthetics” (hereinafter “A New You") and currently
known as “Medical Aesthetics and Cosmetic Surgery” in Henderson, Nevada, specializing in
cosmetic procedures. One of the procedures offered by Dr. Seldon through “A New You’ and
now “Medical Aesthetics and Cosmetic Surgery’ is the injection of botulinum neurotoxin type A
for cosmetic purposes.

IV.

Botulinum neurotoxin type A has been approved by the Federal Drug Administration
(FDA) for human use for limited purposes and the only FDA approved manufacturer of
botulinum neurotoxin type A is Allergen, using the brand name Botox.

V.

Beginning in October 2003 and through September 2005, Dr. Seldon and Mrs. Seldon
began purchasing botulinum neurotoxin type A from a company called Toxin Research
International, Inc. (hereinafter TRI). TRI was based in Tucson, Arizona and was not an
approved manufacturer of botulinum neurotoxin type A for human use. The botulinum
neurotoxin type A manufactured and sold by TRI was called TRItox. TRItox is not and has
never been approved for human use, and, in fact, each vial was labeled, “For research
purposes only, not for human use.” TRI’s invoices also contained the warning, “For research

purposes only, not for human use.”
