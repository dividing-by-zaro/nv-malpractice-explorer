Respondent held a license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada at all

On February 6, 2009, the Investigative Committee filed the Complaint in this
matter alleging a violation of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

allegation contained within the Complaint. Respondent was present and represented by
counsel, Maria Nutile, Esq. The Investigative Committee was represented by
Lyn E. Beggs, Esq.

IV.

On October 13, 2005, Patient A, a fifty-five year old woman, presented to the
Harmon Medical Center, an urgent care center, at 4:26 a.m. with complaints of vomiting
and diarrhea for the preceding five hours. Patient A also reported weakness and tingling
in her extremities. Upon admission, Patient A’s blood pressure was 140/88.

Patient A was seen by Respondent who ordered IV fluids and medications for
Patient A’s complaints and lab work to be completed. Patient A’s blood was taken at
5:21 a.m. and was sent off-site as Harmon Medical Center did not have an on-site lab.
An EKG was also ordered and performed at 5:32 a.m. The EKG results included an
abnormality which was labeled a right bundle branch block (RBBB).

At 5:40 a.m. Patient A’s blood pressure had fallen to 90/60. Additional IV fluids
were provided. Patient A remained nauseated and at 5:50 a.m. vomited.

after she had gone into cardiac arrest.

the address on file with the Board pursuant to NRS and NAC chapters 630 and NRS
chapter 233B.

The Board concludes that that Respondent has violated NRS 630.301(4) as
described above and accordingly is subject to discipline pursuant to NRS 630.352.
IV.
If any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law is more properly deemed a Finding of
Fact, it may be 50 construed.
