reasonable basis to believe that Salvador Borromeo, M.D., hereinafter referred to as "Respondent,"

was admitted to the facility and the admitting physician requested a cardiology consult.
Respondent was the consultant and diagnosed Patient A with acute coronary syndrome.

4. On March 26, 2003, Patient A’s troponin levels increased precipitously, a second
echocardiogram accomplished on the previous day, along with one done on the 26", showed the
development of Q waves in the inferior leads and anterior, which was be indicative of a potential
myocardial infarction. Medical records indicate Respondent believed that Patient A warranted
transfer to a medical facility that could conduct a cardiac catheterization on Patient A. Patient A
was never transferred to another facility and ultimately expired on March 30, 2003.

5. Section 630.301(4) of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that malpractice,
defined as the failure to use the reasonable knowledge, skill and expertise ordinarily used in
similar circumstances, is grounds for discipline.

6. Respondent committed malpractice in the course of providing care and treatment to
Patient A when he failed to ensure the timely transfer of Patient A to another facility to perform
urgent catheterization for the purposes of acutely revascularizing Patient A by either transcatheter
intervention or bypass surgery, and is subject to discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical
Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners fix a time and place for a formal
hearing;

charges herein against him, the time and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions against
