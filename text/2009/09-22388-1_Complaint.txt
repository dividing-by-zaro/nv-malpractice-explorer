In The Matter of Charges and ) Case No. 09-22388-1
Complaint Against )

CARLOS INOCENCIO, M.D., ) FILED

Respondent. ) DEC 2 3 2009

COMPLAINT
The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),

composed of Charles N. Held, M.D., Ms. Renee West, and Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., by and
through Edward O. Cousineau, General Counsel for the Board, having a reasonable basis to believe
that Carlos Inocencio, M.D. (Respondent), has engaged in conduct that is grounds for discipline
pursuant to the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby alleges, charges and complains against
Respondent as follows:

1, Respondent was actively licensed to practice medicine by the Board on September
6, 2001, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and at all
times addressed herein was so licensed. Respondent practices medicine in Las Vegas and his
indicated specialty to the Board is Family Practice.

2. Patient A was a forty-six-year-old female at the time of the events at issue. Her
true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint. Patient B was a twenty-
seven-year-old male at the time of the events at issue. His true identity is not disclosed herein to
protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a
copy of this Complaint.

3. Previous to the preparation of this Complaint, the Nevada State Board of Medical

Examiners has solicited the services of an independent medical expert to review the medical

records of several patients treated by Respondent. The record review included those of both
Patient A and Patient B.

4, The expert’s review of Patient A’s medical records concluded that Respondent
was practicing far outside his scope of family practice and that he should not be acting in the
capacity of a pain management specialist, that his prescribing patterns of controlled substances
for her was reckless and irresponsible, and that they likely resulted in Patient A becoming
addicted to medication that ultimately led to her demise. Specifically, the expert found that
Respondent was noticed that Patient A was obtaining prescriptions from multiple providers, yet
he continued to prescribe controlled substances to her. This was in spite of the fact that
Respondent had a pain management agreement with Patient A, which was repeatedly violated by
Patient A. Respondent failed to document the basis for his medical decision making in the same
manner as would have been used by a provider of primary care and pain management when
prescribing controlled substances. Finally, the expert concluded that the reviewed medical
records lack evidence of sufficient physical examinations for the patients, consistent
documentation of vital signs being monitored throughout the patient’s treatment course, or
medical justification for the continued prescribing of controlled substances, all of which are
required under the appropriate standard of care.

5. The expert’s review of Patient B’s medical records determined that Respondent
was practicing far outside his scope of family practice and that he should not be acting in the
capacity of a pain management specialist, that he over-prescribed controlled substances for
Patient B for a prolonged period of time despite evidence that Patient B was over-medicating and
not taking his medications appropriately, and that a few days before Patient B’s death,
Respondent increased Patient B’s dosage of methadone, and at the same time continued to
prescribe Patient B Fentanyl patches and high doses of Percocet and Ambien CR, which
unquestionably contributed to Patient B’s death. Finally, the expert determined that Respondent
failed to perform sufficient physical examinations or consider appropriate referrals for Patient B
that would have justified the continued prescribing of controlled substances for Patient B, all of

which are required under the appropriate standard of care.
