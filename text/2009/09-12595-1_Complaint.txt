Member, by and through Lyn E. Beggs, General Counsel for the Nevada State Board of Medical

Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Dr. Chaudhari is currently licensed in active status, and was so licensed by the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, hereinafter referred to as “the Board,” on

Revised Statutes, and at all times addressed herein was so licensed.

3. Patient A, a regular patient of Dr. Von Tobel, her family practitioner, presented to
him on March 5, 2002 with a growing lesion in the left groin area with black spots. Dr. Von Tobel

4, Dr. Chaudhari reviewed the specimen and prepared a report on March 11, 2002,
stating a diagnosis of “compound nevus, extends focally to the peripheral margin.” Dr. Chaudhari
commented that the features of the nevus are that of “nevus on special site” and recommended
conservative re-excision.

5. Patient A returned to Dr. Von Tobel on March 21, 2002 for re-excision of the
lesion which was accomplished and the lesion was again sent for to pathology for review.

6. Dr. Chaudhari reviewed this second specimen and on March 25, 2002 prepared a
report stating a diagnosis of “noresidual nevus; central biopsy defect with chronic inflammation
and fibrosis.”

7. On April 23, 2004, Patient A reported to Dr. Von Tobel a change in a lesion on her
left groin that had been present for one month. Dr. Von Tobel again recommended an excisional
biopsy of the lesion which was performed on May 27, 2004 and the lesion was sent to pathology
for review.

8. Dr. Chaudhari reviewed this specimen and prepared a report on May 28, 2004
stating a diagnosis of “malignant melanoma, superficial spreading type, .07 mm of Breslow’s
thickness, Clark level II-III, extends to the peripheral margins.”

9. Dr. Chaudhari subsequently re-reviewed the original specimen from March 7, 2002
and on July 22, 2004, prepared a supplemental report indicating a supplemental diagnosis of “milk
line atypical nevus; with a focus of melanoma, .07 mm Breslow’s Thickness, Clark level I/II,

involving the peripheral margins.”

10. Patient A did undergo treatment for the malignant melanoma.
Count I

under similar circumstances when he failed to diagnosis Patient A’s malignant melanoma when
