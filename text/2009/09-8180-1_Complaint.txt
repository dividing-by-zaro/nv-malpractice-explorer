COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed

of Sohail U. Anjum, M.D., S. Daniel McBride, M.D., and Mr. Van V. Hefner, by and through

Edward Cousineau, General Counsel for the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, having a

reasonable basis to believe that Janet Albright, M.D., hereinafter referred to as "Respondent," has
violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the
Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is licensed in active status to practice medicine in the state of Nevada,
and at all times alleged herein, was so licensed by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners,
pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a fifty-one-year-old female at the time of events at issue. Her true
identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation
served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A first presented to Respondent for a consultation on May 3, 2005, with
complaints of varicose veins in both legs. Respondent ordered a venous duplex scan which was
later accomplished by Patient A. The scan demonstrated an incompetent right greater saphenous
vein, but showed no evidence of an abnormal left greater saphenous vein. Additionally, the left

lesser saphenous vein was found to be incompetent. Respondent recommended a right greater

saphenous and left lesser saphenous venous ablation surgical procedure to address Patient A’s
medical circumstance.

4. On October 20, 2005, after informed consent was obtained for the
aforementioned surgical procedure, Respondent ablated both the right and left greater saphenous
vein and the incompetent left lesser saphenous vein was left untouched.

5. Based upon the foregoing, Respondent failed to use the reasonable knowledge,
skill and expertise ordinarily used in similar circumstances in his treatment of Patient A, in that
the ablation of the left greater sapheous vein was unnecessary based upon the preoperative |.
venous duplex scan and that the surgical procedure accomplished by Respondent did not coincide
with the informed consent obtained from the patient.

6. Section 630.301(4) of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that malpractice,
defined as the failure to use the reasonable knowledge, skill and expertise ordinarily used in
similar circumstances, is grounds for discipline.

7. Respondent committed malpractice in the course of providing care and treatment to
Patient A and is subject to discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided
in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners fix a time and place for a formal
hearing;

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him, the time and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions against
him;

3. That the Board determine what sanctions it deems appropriate to impose for the
violation committed by Respondent; and

4, That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of facts
