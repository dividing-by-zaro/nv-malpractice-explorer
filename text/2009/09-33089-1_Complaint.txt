The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
of Sohail U. Anjum, M.D., Chairman, S. Daniel McBride, M.D., Member, and Van Heffner, |
Member, by and through Lyn E. Beggs, General Counsel for the Nevada State Board of Medical

and was so licensed by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, hereinafter referred to as

Board in which he made several admissions relating to the circumstances surrounding his 1993
conviction.

4, Mr. Boyle was convicted in California in December 1997 of one felony count of
assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.

5. In 1999, the California Respiratory Care Board filed an accusation against
Mr. Boyle containing allegations regarding to Mr. Boyle’s criminal convictions as well as alleging
that Mr. Boyle failed to notify the California Respiratory Care board of his 1997 conviction on his
1998 California renewal application.

6. On September 10, 1999, the California Respiratory Care Board revoked
Mr. Boyle’s license to practice respiratory care in the state of California by default as Mr. Boyle
was unable to be contacted by the California Respiratory Care Board as he had failed to update his
address with the California Respiratory Care Board.

7. Mr. Boyle was subsequently convicted of a misdemeanor offense of disturbing the
peace in the state of California in July 2001.

8. In April 2005, Mr. Boyle was again convicted of a criminal offense in the state of
California and was placed on probation.

9. On April 17, 2007, Mr. Boyle signed, dated and had notarized, his application to
the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners for a license to practice respiratory care.

10. Mr. Boyle answered negatively to question #12 of the application which reads,
“Thjave you ever been investigated for, charged with, convicted of or plead guilty or nolo
contendere to any offense or violation of any federal (including U.S. Military), state or local law,
including any foreign country, which is a misdemeanor, gross misdemeanor, court-martial, or
felony, excluding any minor traffic offense (driving or in control of a motor vehicle while under
the influence is not considered a minor traffic offense) or for any offense which is related to the
manufacture, distribution, prescribing, or dispensing of controlled substances?” Mr. Boyle failed
to provide any information regarding any of his previous convictions.

11. Mr. Boyle answered negatively to question #20 of the application which reads,

“thjas your certification or licensure to provide respiratory care services or any other healing art,

been subject to an investigation or ever been subject to being limited, restricted, suspended or
revoked in any state, country or U.S. territory?” Mr. Boyle failed to provide any information
regarding the revocation of his California license to practice respiratory care.

12. As indicated above, Mr. Boyle was issued a license to practice respiratory care in
the state of Nevada on October 22, 2007.

13. On January 27, 2008, Mr. Boyle renewed his license to practice respiratory care in
the state of Nevada via on-line renewal. Again Mr. Boyle answered negatively to questions
pertaining to prior criminal convictions and failed to disclose the revocation of his California
license to practice respiratory care.

Count I

14. | Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.540(1) provides that willfully and
intentionally making a false or fraudulent statement in applying for or renewing a license to
practice respiratory care is ground for initiating discipline against a licensee.

15. Mr. Boyle willfully and intentionally made false or fraudulent statements to the
Board in applying for licensure to practice respiratory care in Nevada in 2007, and again when he
renewed his license in January 2008, when he failed to disclose any of his previous criminal
convictions and accordingly he has violated NAC 630.540(1).

16. Mr. Boyle willfully and intentionally made false or fraudulent statements to the
Board in applying for licensure to practice respiratory care in Nevada in 2007, and again when he
renewed his license in January 2008, when he failed to disclose the revocation of his California
license to practice respiratory care and accordingly he has violated NAC 540(1).

17. By reason of the foregoing, Mr. Boyle is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.355 of the Nevada Administrative Code.

Count It

18. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.540(11) provides that conviction of a
felony, any offense involving moral turpitude or any offense relating to the practice of respiratory
care or the ability to practice respiratory care is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.
