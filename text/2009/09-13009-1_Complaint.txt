COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time of approval of the filing of the instant complaint, of Sohail U. Anjum, M_D.,
S. Daniel McBride, M.D. and Mr. Van Heffner, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Jon Siems, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Dr. Siems, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter
630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and
allegations, as follows:

1. Dr. Siems is currently licensed in active status, and was so licensed by the Nevada
State Board of Medical Examiners, on December 20, 1999 (License No. 9250), pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and at all times addressed herein was
so licensed.

2. Patient A was a forty-three year old female at the time she first presented to
Dr. Siems. Her true identify is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in
the Patient Designation served on Dr. Siems along with a copy of this Complaint.

3, Patient A first presented to Dr. Siems on January 3, 2002 for a pre-operative
examination for consideration of Lasik surgery. The records indicate that Patient A had been out
of her contacts only one day and understood that her refraction would need to be rechecked before
a final determination could be made as to whether she could proceed forward with the surgery.

Her uncorrected visual acuity was noted to be 20/50 in the left eye and 20/400 in the right.

4. During the initial visit Patient A had refractions completed which showed
asymmetry, with the right eye showing astigmatism and the left eye showing spherical myopia
with no astigmatism. The impression noted an “unstable poor orb scan.”

5. On January 18, 2002, Patient A was re-evaluated. Her refraction was found to be
stable. An Orbscan was performed on both eyes, the right eye showing an asymmetric
astigmatism. The Orbscan was also used to obtain an optical pachymetry reading showing the
thinnest corneal thickness in the right eye to be 543 microns and the in left eye to be 532 microns.
Keratometric readings showed a steep curvature in the right eye up to 49.5 and in the left up to
47.6. The medical record from January 18, 2002 indicates “do not see reason not to proceed.”

6. Patient A underwent Lasik surgery on February 9, 2002 on both eyes and returned
on February 10, 2002 for her first post-operative visit and was noted to be doing very well. Her
uncorrected visual acuity was 20/15 in the left eye and 20/25+2 in the right eye.

7. At Patient A’s one month post-operative visit on March 8, 2002, she reported
blurry vision in the morning that took a couple of hours to clear but was happy with her visual
acuity. Her visual acuity in her right eye was 20/40 -2 and 20/15 in the left. The record indicates
residual astigmatism in her right eye and the left eye doing well.

8. During Patient A’s two month post-operative visit on April 9, 2002, she reported
her right eye was still blurry, that her eyes were tired and she was experiencing burning. Her
visual acuity was 20/40 +2 in her right eye and in the left remained at 20/15. The medical record
indicates she had 1 diopter of astigmatism in her right eye.

9. Patient A had her three month post-operative visit on May 7, 2002 at which time
her visual acuity was better and she was noted as doing well.

10. Patient A saw Dr. Siems for a nine month post-operative examination at which time
she reported that the visual acuity in her right eye had been blurry for two weeks. Her visual
acuity was 20/80 in her right eye and 20/20 +2 in her left. A repeat Orbscan was completed during
the appointment indicating Patient A had 4 diopters of astigmatism with “K” values of 46 x 50.

11. Patient A was seen again on October 29, 2002 where it was noted that there were

no changes since she had been seen the previous week. Dr. Siems noted that Patient A was

experiencing regression in her right eye. He recommended that Patient A be fitted with a toric
contact lens.

12. Patient A was seen again on June 1, 2004 at which time she reported that her visual
acuity had decreased, especially in her right eye. Medical records indicate the visual acuity in her
right eye had decreased to 20/400. Another Orbscan was completed which also showed an increase
in the right eye astigmatism. A contact lens was ordered for the right eye.

13. Patient A was seen on July 2, 2004 and reported visual acuity in the right eye was
okay and that she did not like wearing the contact lens. Patient A also discussed with Dr. Siems a
possible enhancement being done on the left eye as visual acuity in that eye had decreased to 20/50
+1. The enhancement procedure was performed on the left eye on July 28, 2004.

14. Patient A continued to see Dr. Siems through March 21, 2005. Various contact
lenses were tried in her right eye with no success and she continued to complain about blurry,
fuzzy vision. At her appointment on March 21, 2005 she was referred to another physician in
Dr. Siems practice to discuss possible placement of Intacs.

15. Patient A did see Dr. Rouweyha in Dr. Siems office on July 11, 2005 and it was
noted in the impression that Patient A had progressive corneal irregularity and an unstable cornea.
Intacs was discussed but Patient A did not return for placement of the Intacs.

Count I

16. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of
a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

17. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

18. Dr. Siems failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when he advised Patient A to proceed with Lasik surgery when she
had several issues present pre-operatively that would indicate she had forme furst keratoconus and
was pre-disposed to corneal ectasia. Specifically, her refractive measurements were significantly

dissimilar, her corneal thickness was asymmetric, her Orbscan topography showed asymmetric

astigmatism in the right eye and she had a steep keratometric reading on the right eye. Accordingly
Dr. Siems is subject to discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in
Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners fix a time and place for a
formal hearing;

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Dr. Siems notice of the
charges herein against him, the time and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions
against him;

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it to
impose for the violation or violations committed by Dr. Siems; and

4. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Dr. Siems its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions
imposed; and

5. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners take such other and further
action as may be just and proper in these premises.
