composed of Sohail U. Anjum, M.D., S. Daniel McBride, M.D., and Mr. Van V. Hefner, by and
through Edward Cousineau, General Counsel for the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Koussay Zarka, M.D., hereinafter referred to as

investigation by the IC, Respondent admitted that he had no medical records to support the
prescriptions provided to Patient A.

5. Between August of 2005 and April of 2007, Respondent wrote at least seven
prescriptions for medications that were dispensed to Patient B. In response to the underlying
investigation by the IC, Respondent denied ever treating Patient B, and therefore, had no medical
records to support the prescriptions provided to Patient B.

6. Section 630.3062(1) of the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) provides that failure to
maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of a patient, is grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

7. Respondent violated NRS 630.3062(1) when he failed to maintain medical records
related to the prescriptions provided to Patients A and B and is subject to discipline by the Nevada
State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners fix a time and place for a formal
hearing;

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him, the time and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions against
him;

3. That the Board determine what sanctions it deems appropriate to impose for the
violation committed by Respondent; and

4. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of facts,

conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed.
