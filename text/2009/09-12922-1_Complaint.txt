Dear Dr. Bell:

Inquiry Panel A (“Panel”) of the Colorado Board of Medical Examiners has concluded
its inquiry regarding your role in the care and treatment of patient J.L. It was the
Panel's decision not to commence with formal proceedings against your license to
practice medicine. However, the Panel did vote to administer disciplinary action to
you in the form of this letter of admonition.

As you may recall, just after midnight on June 15, 2005, 19-year-old patient J.L., who
had undergone a tracheostomy in June 2005, presented at the emergency room
complaining of chest pain and difficulty breathing. J.L.’s' tracheostomy tube had
become displaced and had been re-inserted. To evaluate whether the tube was
appropriately replaced, anterior-posterior interior and lateral x-rays were taken and
transmitted to you, along with comparison images ‘from October 2004. You read the
anterior-posterior interior x-rays only and reported an unchanged status. J.L. was
discharged from the hospital. J.L.’s symptoms continued to worsen and he suffered
cardiac arrest. J.L. expired after returning to the emergency department by ambulance
several hours later.

After a review of all the information in this matter, the Panel found that your care and
treatment of patient J.L. fell below the generally accepted standards of practice for a
radiologist, constituting a violation of section 12-36-117 of the Colorado Revised
Statutes. Specifically, you failed to note differences between the October 2004 and
June 2005 studies, which warranted further investigation such as review of the lateral
film. Although information sent to you clearly stated that the current study consisted
of two films, you only reviewed the anterior-posterior image and failed to review the
lateral view or to request that it be resent prior to rendering your report.

By this letter, the Panel hereby admonishes you and cautions you that complaints
disclosing any repetition of such practice may lead to the commencement of formal
disciplinary proceedings against your license to practice. medicine, wherein this letter
of admonition may be entered into evidence as aggravation.

You are advised that it is your right to have this case reviewed in an administrative
proceeding. To do so, you must submit a written request within twenty (20) days after
receipt of this letter. In your request, you must clearly ask that formal disciplinary
proceedings be initiated against you to adjudicate the propriety of the conduct upon
which this letter of admonition is based. If such request is timely made, this letter of
admonition will be deemed vacated, and the matter will be processed by means of a
formal complaint and hearing. This is in accordance with the provisions of the
Medical Practice Act governing the discipline of licensed physicians.

Sincerely,

FOR THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS
