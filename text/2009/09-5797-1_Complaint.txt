The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time of approval of the filing of the instant complaint, of Charles N. Held, M.D.,
Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D. and Ms. Jean Stoess, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Kenneth Westfield, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Dr. Westfield, has violated the provisions of
NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Dr. Westfield is currently licensed in active status, and was so licensed by the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, on January 1, 1980 (License No. 3953), pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and at all times addressed herein
was so licensed.

2. Patient A was a fifty-nine year old male at the time he first presented to
Dr. Westfield. His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed
in the Patient Designation served on Dr. Westfield along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A presented to Dr. Westfield for the first time on March 1, 2000. Patient A
had no prior ocular history and wore only over-the-counter reading glasses. He also used over-the-
counter artificial tears as needed for dry eyes. He reported that he was recently diagnosed with

20/25-3 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. His best corrected visual acuity was 20/20-2 for
the right eye and 20/30 for the left eye.

4. Dr. Westfield noted an impression of diabetes, astigmatism and age related macular
degeneration, left eye greater than right. Patient A was scheduled for a Lasik work up for possible
Lasik surgery to be performed on his left eye, aiming for -1.00.

5. Patient A returned on March 6, 2000 for his pre-operative workup. The cycloplegic
refraction on his left eye at the time was +0.50 +0.50 x 001 with best corrected refraction of 20/30
+1. Informed consent was also provided and Patient A signed an informed consent form.

6. Patient A underwent the Lasik procedure on his left eye on March 27, 2000. The
programmed correction was +0.75. He was seen for his first post-operative visit the following day
on March 28, 2000 and reported that his eye felt fine. There were no issues noted.

7. Patient A was seen four more times post-operatively through May 31, 2000. His
uncorrected vision varied between 20/25 and 20/30.

8. Patient A returned to see Dr. Westfield on July 23, 2002 with complaints that his
reading vision seemed weaker. Patient A’s uncorrected vision was 20/25 on the right eye and
20/30 +1 on the left. Best corrected was 20/20 on the right eye and 20/25 +1 on the left.
Dr. Westfield’s examination noted mild cataract, diabetes, age-related macular degeneration and
no evidence of retinopathy. The plan was for a Lasik enhancement on the left eye, aiming for -
1.25. It was noted that Patient A wished to proceed and Patient A did sign a new informed consent
form. There is no record indicating that topography, pachymetry or a Schirmer’s test were
completed prior to determining to proceed forward with the Lasik enhancement.

9. Patient A underwent the Lasik enhancement procedure on August 20, 2002 with a
programmed correction of +1.56+0.50 x 148.

10. Patient A returned for his first post-operative visit on August 21, 2002 indicating
that he had done okay the previous night. Patient A subsequently saw Dr. Westfield on multiple
occasions through June 2006 with continuing complaints of foggy, blurry vision and pain. Patient
A had significant fluctuations in visual acuity over the next several years and suffered from

keratitis sicca.

11. At the time of Patient A’s last appointment with Dr. Westfield, his uncorrected
vision was 20/30 in his right eye and 20/100 — 1 in his left. Patient A continued to complain about
very foggy vision in his left eye even with correction.
