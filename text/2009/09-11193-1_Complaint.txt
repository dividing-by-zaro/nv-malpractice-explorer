4. In July 2001, Dr. Anthony provided medical care to one patient that was outside of
restrictions placed on this license and subsequently on August 31, 2001, Utah suspended
Dr. Anthony’s remaining medical privileges.

5. On February 4, 2002, Dr. Anthony pled no contest to one count of Negligent
Homicide, a Class A Misdemeanor in Utah, in association with the care of a patient in 1999.

6. On August 26, 2003, Dr. Anthony entered into a Stipulation and Order with Utah
which stayed the suspension of his medical privileges and placed him on probation for a period of
five years with multiple conditions. In November 2003, Utah modified the Stipulation and Order,
lessening the restrictions on Dr. Anthony’s Utah license.

7. In December 2005, the Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners filed a formal disciplinary complaint against Dr. Anthony regarding the
suspension of his Utah medical license, his failure to timely report the suspension to the Nevada
Board of Medical Examiners and his failure to disclose his suspension or probation on his 2005
Nevada renewal application.

8. Dr. Anthony entered into a settlement agreement with the Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners in September 2006 regarding two of the three counts contained in the formal
complaint. Dr. Anthony’s Nevada license was suspended for one year, with the suspension being
stayed on the condition that he remain in compliance with and satisfactorily complete his Utah
probation among other terms and conditions.

9. On September 29, 2008 Utah issued an order terminating Dr. Anthony’s probation
indicating that he had unsatisfactorily completed the terms and conditions of his August 2003
Stipulation and Order.

10. On November 24-25, 2008 a hearing was held by the Division of Occupational and
Professional Licensing of the State of Utah, to determine whether disciplinary action should be
taken against Dr. Anthony’s Utah medical license based on multiple allegations.

11. On January 28, 2009, an Administrative Law Judge issued a Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Recommended Order which was adopted the same day by the director of

the Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing of the State of Utah and which revoked

Dr. Anthony’s Utah medical license. The revocation was recommended based upon evidence
presented regarding a variety of issues including but not limited to Dr. Anthony keeping sample
medications in his vehicle, including controlled substances and other prescription medications;
repackaging and relabeling said medications and dispensing them to patients; his relationship with
a woman and his treatment of she and her son; his use prescription forms bearing an inaccurate
address; his failure to submit a triplicate copy of a prescription in violation of his August 2003
order and his failure to disclose his Utah disciplinary sanction to Nevada during licensing renewal.

12. Dr. Anthony did timely notify the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners on

February 13, 2009 that his Utah license to practice medicine was revoked.
Count I

13. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(3) provides that the revocation of a
license to practice any type of medicine by another state is grounds for initiating discipline against
a licensee.

2009 and accordingly Dr. Anthony is subject to discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical
Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1, That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners fix a time and place for a
