4, Patient A was evaluated by a nurse who then contacted Dr. Lyons, who was on call,
at 0430 to report his initial vital signs. Breastfeeding was attempted at 0630, but Patient A was not
interested.

5. Dr. Lyons assessed Patient A for the first time at 0745 and no concerns other than a
rash were noted.

6. At 0820, the nurses’ notes for Patient A indicate poor feeding and a cyanotic episode.

7. At 1000, the nurses’ notes indicate that Patient A’s hands and feet were occasionally
cyanotic but returned to normal. He remained uninterested in feeding.

8. At 1130 Patient A’s extremities were slightly cyanotic and he was grunting. He was
noted as having a pulse oximetry level of 98%.

9. Patient A was still not interested in breastfeeding at 1430 and a lactation consultant
was sent to consult with the mother and Patient A. Attempts to have Patient A breastfeed were
unsuccessful.

10. At 1630 patient was noted to have dusky color with oxygen saturation at 75%. He
was rebundled and his oxygen saturation increased to 95-96% and returned to pink color. He was
still not interested in feeding. Nursing notes indicate that Dr. Lyon’s was notified of this incident;
however, it appears that Dr. Lyons had gone off shift at 1600 and another physician was on call for
the night.

11. At 1900, Patient A’s oxygen saturation was 97% and his mother again tried
unsuccessfully to breastfeed him.

12. Breastfeeding was again attempted at 0330 on April 24, 2003, but Patient A was still
not latching. He was taken to the nursery where it was noted he had a weak cry and was lethargic.
He was finger fed and afterwards was noted to be tachypnic. His pulse oximetry level was 98-100%
on his right foot but only 89-92% on his right wrist. The nurses’ notes indicate that his pulse
oximetry levels went lower when he was crying, to 91-93% on his foot and 87-89% on his wrist.
The covering physician, Dr. Dunlap was notified of Patient A’s status and he indicated he would
report it to Dr. Lyons.

13. Dr. Lyons came back on shift at 0630 at which time she spoke with Dr. Dunlap about
Patient A’s condition. Dr. Lyon’s ordered a chest x-ray, two view, and blood pressure checks on all
four of Patient A’s extremities. The chest x-ray was read by a radiologist as normal.

14. Dr. Lyons examined Patient A at this time and noted a normal cardiovascular
examination and continued poor breastfeeding. The physician progress notes indicated that cyanosis
had been noted by the nurses. Dr. Lyons noted that a lactation consultant should continue to work
with the mother and child as suggested by the nursing staff and that it was possible that the mother
and Patient A might be discharged later that day if breastfeeding Patient A was breast feeding well.
No other referrals were made or consults were requested to assess Patient A’s condition.

15. Patient A had another cyanotic episode at 1100 which did not improve and he was
taken to the nursery. Nursing staff contact Dr. Lyons regarding pulse oximetry readings which varied
widely and his cyanosis. Dr. Lyons contacted Dr. Susan Pintar, the on-call pediatrician who
recommended an ENT consultation for possible concerns of an airway obstruction.

16. Dr. Romaneschi performed the ENT consult and noted that Patient A’s upper airway
appeared intact, his palate was intact and that he had normal appearing vocal cords.

17.__-Dr. Pintar also did an evaluation of Patient A. She noted very poor peripheral
perfusion and mottled appearing skin and she commented on the normal chest x-ray.

18. At 1230, Patient A was observed to have a stiffening of the upper and lower
extremities and his gaze became fixed with unresponsive pupils. He stabilized for a brief period and
then suffered another seizure like episode with a very irregular breathing pattern. He was incubated
and bagged and then put briefly on a ventilator.

19. Patient A suffered another seizure at approximately 1415 and his heart rate fell
causing resuscitative measures to be taken. A transport team arrived at the hospital at approximately
1430 to transport Patient A to the NICU at Washoe Medical Center.

20. Patient A remained hospitalized until May 19, 2003 with a diagnosis of Group B
streptocci meningitis, Group B streptococci newborn sepsis, Group B streptococci septic shock,
respiratory insufficiency, pleural effusion, murmur, thrombocytopenia, seizures, cholestatic jaundice,

21. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of
a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

22. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds |’
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

23. Dr. Lyons failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when she failed to develop an alternative treatment plan for Patient A
or take any other action after assessing him, other than continuing with a treatment plan that had
success of simply having a lactation consultant work with Patient A and his mother on feeding
when Patient A had multiple episodes of cyanotic events, tachypnea and abnormal pulse oximetry
readings in light of a normal chest x-ray and cardiac assessment.

24. By reason of the foregoing, Dr. Lyons is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
