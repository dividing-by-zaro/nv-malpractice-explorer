COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Board of Medical Examiners of the state of Nevada,

composed of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Cindy Lamerson, M.D., Member, and
Jean Stoess, M.A., Member, by and through Lyn E. Beggs, General Counsel for the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners, having a reasonable basis to believe that Carlos Ermocilla, M.D.,
has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the
Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Dr. Ermocilla is currently licensed in active status, and was so licensed by the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, hereinafter referred to as “the Board,” on
September 22, 2004 (License No. 11167), pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada
Revised Statutes, and at all times addressed herein was so licensed.

2. Patient A was a fifty-five year old female at the time of the events set forth herein.
Her true identify is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Dr. Ermocilla along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On October 13, 2005, Patient A presented to the Harmon Medical Center, an urgent
care center, at 4:26 a.m. with complaints of vomiting and diarrhea for the preceding five hours.

5. Dr. Ermocilla ordered [V fluids and medications for Patient A’s complaints and lab
work be completed. Patient A’s blood was taken at 5:21 a.m. and was sent off site as Harmon
Medical Center did not have an on-site lab.

6. An EKG was also ordered and performed at 5:32 am. The EKG results included
an abnormality which was labeled a right bundle branch block (RBBB).

7. At 5:40 a.m. Patient A’s blood pressure had fallen to 90/60. Additional IV fluids
were provided. Patient A remained nauseated and at 5:50 a.m. vomited. .

8. At approximately 6:45 a.m. Patient A went into cardiac arrest. Efforts were made
to revive her, but Patient A ultimately expired due to a myocardial infarct.

Count I

9. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of
a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

10. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

11. Dr. Ermocilla failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when he failed to recognize that Patient A was acutely ill and seek
emergency medical care for her until she had gone into cardiac arrest and thus he has violated
NRS 630.301(4).

12. By reason of the foregoing, Dr. Ermocilla is subject to discipline by the Nevada
State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners fix a time and place for a
formal hearing;

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent, notice of the
charges herein against him, the time and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions
against him;
