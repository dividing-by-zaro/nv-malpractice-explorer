COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(Board) hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Karen F. Arcotta, M.D.

(Respondent), a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the
Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

l. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 4896). At all times
alleged herein, Respondent was licensed in an active status by the Board pursuant to the
provisions of the Medical Practice Act.

2. Respondent is medically trained in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Diseases.
Respondent is not trained or certified in plastic surgery, liposuction, tumescent liposuction, fat
transfers, or surgery.

3. Mr. Trevor Schmidt is a physician assistant licensed by both the Board and the
Nevada State Board of Osteopathic Medicine. He is the owner and operator of MyShapeLipo,

where he performs liposuction, tumescent liposuction, fat transfers, and other procedures.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners was composed of Board members
Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Michael J. Fischer, M.D., and Ms. Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF.

4, In late December 2014, Mr. Schmidt requested Respondent to serve as his
supervising physician.

5. Respondent agreed, and on December 29, 2014, Respondent executed a
Notification of Supervision of Physician Assistant. It is marked as “received” by the Board on
January 2, 2015.

6. Respondent was scheduled to undergo a major surgery on January 12, 2015. She
planned to arrange procedures for supervising Mr. Schmidt in February, after her surgery. She
developed complications from the surgery and was readmitted to the hospital on January 26, 2015,
and was transferred to rehabilitation on February 10, 2015.

7. Respondent never visited Mr. Schmidt’s facility, never reviewed any of his medical
records, and never observed him providing any medical services.

8. Mr. Schmidt’s medical records indicate that he saw approximately 44 patients
during the month of January 2015. These records indicate that he saw one patient on January 12,
2015, the date of Respondent’s surgery. Mr. Schmidt saw four patients on January 13, 2015.
Mr. Schmidt saw 4 patients on January 26, 2016, the date Respondent was readmitted to the
hospital after developing complications from her surgery. On January 27, 2015, Mr. Schmidt
performed three liposuction procedures on three different female patients.

9. On February 2, 2015, the Board received a Notice of Termination of Supervising /
Collaboration Agreement stating that, effective January 30, 2015, Respondent was no longer Mr.
Schmidt’s supervising physician. Also on February 2, 2015, the Board received a copy of a
Notification to the State Board of Osteopathic Medicine, dated January 29, 2015, that Dr. Leo
Capobianco, DO, was Mr. Schmidt’s supervising physician.

10. Previous to the preparation of this Complaint, the Board solicited the services of an
independent medical expert (IME) to render an opinion regarding whether Respondent through
her acts and omissions violated the Medical Practice Act related to her supervision of
Mr. Schmidt. The IME opined that the procedures performed by Mr. Schmidt were outside the
scope of Respondent’s practice, and that Respondent failed to adequately supervise Mr. Schmidt.

11. | Based upon the foregoing, the IC charges Respondent with the following violations

of the Medical Practice Act.
COUNT I
(Failure to Supervise Physician Assistant - NAC 630.230(1)@))

12. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set
forth herein.

13. NAC 630.230(1)(@) provides that a physician shall not fail to provide adequate
supervision of a physician assistant. NRS 630.306(16) states that it is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action if a licensee engages in any act that is unsafe or unprofessional conduct in
accordance with the regulations of the Board. Additionally, NRS 630.3065(3) provides that it is
grounds for initiating disciplinary action when a physician willfully fails to perform a statutory or
other legal obligation imposed upon him or her as a physician.

14. NAC 630.360(1)(b) provides that the medical services that a physician assistant is
authorized to perform must be within the scope of practice of the supervising physician.

15. NAC 630.370 sets forth the duties of a supervising physician, which include,
among other things: be available to consult at all times that the physician assistant is performing
medical services; at least once a month, spend part of the day with the physician assistant to
consult and monitor quality of care; review selected charts of the physician assistant; and
designate an alternate supervising physician if the supervising physician is unable to supervise the
physician assistant.

16. | Respondent failed to adequately supervise Mr. Schmidt because Respondent is not
medically trained in surgery, liposuction, fat transfers, or the other medical services Mr. Schmidt
performed. Therefore these medical services are outside the scope of Respondent's practice.

17. Respondent failed to adequately supervise Mr. Schmidt because Respondent was
not available at all times that Mr. Schmidt was performing medical services, including, but not
limited to, January 12, January 13, and January 27, 2015, dates on which Mr. Schmidt performed
liposuction procedures and other medical services.

18. Respondent failed to designate an alternate supervising physician to supervise
Mr. Schmidt, even though Respondent knew she was scheduled for surgery on January 12, 2015,
about two weeks after she signed the Notification of Supervising Physician.

19. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1, That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against her and give
her notice that she may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an
Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine the sanctions it will impose if it finds Respondent
violated the Medical Practice Act;

4. That the Board make, issue and serve upon the Respondent, in writing, its findings
of fact, conclusions of law and order, which shall include the sanctions imposed; and

5. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these
premises.
