3, On or about April 13, 2012, Patient A presented to Renown Regional Medical
Center, in Reno, Nevada. Respondent performed an upper and lower blepharoplasty with laser
resurfacing of her lower eyelids.

4. Prior to the surgery, Patient A had no visual acuity problems or other problems
with her eyes.

5. Respondent did not note any complications or problems in the operative report.
Respondent did not use globe protection or an eyeshield to protect the eyes during the procedure.

6. Immediately after surgery, in recovery, Patient A noticed vision problems in her
right eye. While in recovery, she notified a nurse of this problem.

7. Respondent did not examine Patient A after surgery, nor prior to discharging her
home.

8. Approximately 24 or 48 hours after the surgery, Patient A received a call from
Respondent, during which she informed him that she was experiencing vision problems in her
right eye, and wanted him to examine it. However, Respondent did not examine her eye, and
instead said that she would be fine and he would see her at her first postoperative visit.

9, Three days after the aforementioned surgery, on April 16, 2012, Patient A saw
Respondent for her first postoperative visit. She expressed concern about still having blurriness in
her vision in her right eye. He examined her eye at that time for the first time but "could not see
anything," according to his records. He prescribed Maxitrol and closed the patient's eye with a
patch.

10. On April 18, 2012, Patient A returned for another postoperative visit for suture
removal. She expressed concern that her vision was still blurry in her right eye. Respondent
believed she had a bit of corneal abrasion. Because Respondent did not have the equipment to
further investigate or stain the cornea, Respondent immediately referred her to an
ophthalmologist.

11. The same day, April 18, 2012, the ophthalmologist examined Patient A and
diagnosed her with an ocular laceration with prolapsed or exposure of intra ocular tissue. The

ophthalmologist scheduled surgery for the next day to repair the injury.

12. Patient A now suffers with permanent visual disturbance of light, halo formation,
residual scarring of the cornea, loss of tissue of the iris, and a sector cataract at the point of injury.
Patient A will require further surgery on her cornea and a cataract removal with lens placement in
the future.

PATIENT B

13. Patient B was a 55-year-old female at the time of the events at issue. Her true
identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation
served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

14. On December 28, 2012, Patient B presented to Respondent at the Summit Surgery
Center in Reno, Nevada for a bilateral upper lid blepharoplasty.

15. Prior to the surgery, the patient had no visual acuity problems or other problems
with her eyes.

16. | Respondent did not note any complications or problems in the operative report.
Respondent did not use globe protection or an eyeshield to protect the eye during the procedure.

17. At Patient B's first postoperation examination on January 2, 2013, she did not
mention any problems with her vision or with pain in her eyes. Puffy eyelids were noted, but no
other problems.

18. On January 11, 2013, Patient B called Respondent's office and left a message
complaining of blurred vision and pain in her right eye.

19. On January 16, 2013, Respondent examined Patient B and diagnosed corneal
edema and prescribed a Medrol Dosepack.

20. On January 21, 2013, Patient B again called Respondent's office and complained
that she could not see out of her right eye. Respondent referred her to an optometrist, who referred
her to an ophthalmologist.

21. On January 23, 2013, the ophthalmologist diagnosed her with a corneal laceration
with iris incarceration and performed emergency surgery to repair the injury.

22. Patient B still suffers from distorted vision in her right eye, intermittent nausea, and

she must wear a rigid gas-permeable contact lens which she finds uncomfortable.

COUNT I
(Malpractice - Failure to Perform With Reasonable Care When Performing Operation
Patient A - NRS 630.301(4))

23. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is an act, among others, that constitutes
grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

24. Malpractice is defined as "the failure of a physician, in treating a patient, to use the
reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances." NAC 630.040.

25. The standard of care in cases such as Patient A’s is to use either corneal protectors
or to exercise special care with sharp instruments used near the eye.

26. | Respondent did not use corneal protectors or other eye protection during part of the
procedure. The patient suffered a laceration of the cornea, a complication which ordinarily should
not occur during this type of procedure.

27. Respondent failed to use reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinary used under
the circumstances by failing to use corneal protectors, or to exercise adequate care or skill to avoid
damage to the eye when performing the procedure without eye globe protection.

28. As a direct result of Respondent's failure to use reasonable care, skill, or
knowledge ordinarily used in the circumstances, Patient A suffered a laceration of her cornea,
which required emergency surgery to address. She still suffers from scarring of the cornea, visual
disturbances such as halo formation, and a cataract which will require future surgery and lens
placement.

29. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
(Malpractice - Failure to Promptly Examine or Refer Patient
Patient A - NRS 630.301(4))

30. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is an act, among others, that constitutes

grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

31. Malpractice is defined as "the failure of a physician, in treating a patient, to use the
reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances." NAC 630.040.

32. The standard of care when a patient complains of eye pain or blurriness in vision is
to examine the cornea with Flourescein staining, or to refer the patient to a specialist promptly.

33. Patient A complained-of vision problems in her right eye immediately after
surgery, and at her first postop exam, three days after surgery.

34. | Respondent did not examine her eye with Flourescein staining, nor did he
immediately refer her to a specialist. Instead, he assumed that she had a bit of corneal abrasion and
he prescribed Maxitrol and closed her eye with a patch. |

35. Patient A complained again two days later, at which point Respondent referred her
to an ophthalmologist, who performed emergency surgery the next day to repair the injury.

36. As a direct result of Respondent's failure to use reasonable care, skill, or
knowledge ordinarily used in the circumstances, Patient A was not correctly diagnosed until five
days after surgery. Had Respondent promptly referred her to a specialist, she likely would have
received treatment more quickly and experienced a better outcome.

37. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT Jil
(Malpractice - Failure to Perform With Reasonable Care When Performing Operation
Patient B - NRS 630.301(4))

38. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is an act, among others, that constitutes
grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

39. Malpractice is defined as "the failure of a physician, in treating a patient, to use the
reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances." NAC 630.040.

40. The standard of care in such cases is to use either corneal protectors or to exercise
special care with sharp instruments used near the eye.

41. Despite a very similar injury occurring to another patient (Patient A) approximately
six to eight months earlier, Respondent did not use corneal protectors or other eye protection
during part of the procedure. Patient B suffered a laceration of the cornea, a complication which
ordinarily should not occur during this type of procedure.

42. Respondent failed to use reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinary used under
the circumstances by failure to use corneal protectors, or to exercise adequate care or skill to avoid
damage to the eye when performing the procedure without eye globe protection.

43. As a direct result of Respondent's failure to use reasonable care, skill, or
knowledge ordinarily used in the circumstances, Patient B suffered a laceration of her cornea,
which required emergency surgery to address. She still suffers from scarring of the cornea, visual
disturbances, occasional nausea, and must wear a rigid contact she finds uncomfortable.

44. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.301(4).

COUNT IV
(Malpractice - Failure to Promptly Examine or Refer Patient to a Specialist
Patient B - NRS 630.301(4))

45. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is an act, among others, that constitutes
grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

46. Malpractice is defined as "the failure of a physician, in treating a patient, to use the
reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances." NAC 630.040.

47. The standard of care when a patient complains of eye pain or blurriness of vision is
to examine the cornea with Flourescein staining, or to refer the patient to a specialist promptly.

48. Patient B complained of pain and blurriness in her right eye on January 11, 2013.

49. Despite the fact that a very similar injury occurred to another patient undergoing a
similar procedure approximately six to eight months prior, Respondent did not examine Patient B
until January 16, 2013. At that time he diagnosed corneal edema and prescribed a Medrol
Dosepack, but did not refer her to an ophthalmologist.

50. Patient B complained again of pain and vision problems on January 21, 2013.
Respondent then referred her to an optometrist, who examined her and referred her to an
ophthalmologist.

51. The ophthalmologist saw Patient B on January 23, 2013, and diagnosed a corneal
laceration with iris incarceration. He performed emergency surgery later that day to repair the
injury.

52. As a direct result of Respondent's failure to use reasonable care, skill, or
knowledge ordinarily used in the circumstances, Patient B was not correctly diagnosed until
approximately 3.5 weeks after surgery. Had Respondent promptly referred her to a specialist, she
likely would have received treatment more quickly and experienced a better outcome.

53. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an
Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine the sanctions it will impose if it finds Respondent
violated the Medical Practice Act;

4, That the Board make, issue and serve upon the Respondent, in writing, its findings
of fact, conclusions of law and order, which shall include the sanctions imposed; and
