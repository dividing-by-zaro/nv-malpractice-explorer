COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board) hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Lo Fu Tan, M.D. (Respondent),
a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a reasonable basis to
believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630
and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 10849), and has been
so licensed by the Board since March 13, 2004, and, at all times alleged herein, Respondent was
licensed in an active status by the Board pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice Act.

2. Patient A was a 47-year-old male at the time of the events at issue. His true identity
is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation served
upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Previous to the preparation of this Complaint, the Board solicited the services of an

independent medical expert (IME) to review the medical records of Patient A and render an

opinion regarding whether Respondent failed to perform to the standard of care and treatment
which could constitute malpractice under the Medical Practice Act.

4, On or about November 12, 2012, Patient A was admitted into the Siena Urgent
Care with a history of breathing problems for six (6) months and had used Albuterol treatments,
which he felt were not working appropriately, at home, on the day of admission. Patient A’s vital
signs showed an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air, blood pressure of 156/86, pulse of 93,
respiratory rate of 17 and a temperature of 98.0 F. This initial examination revealed that Patient A
was not in respiratory distress but was experiencing some wheezing.

5. On or about November 12, 2012, based upon Respondent’s orders, Patient A was
started on Albuterol and Ipraropium by a nebulizer. Minutes later, after treatment on the
nebulizer, Patient A’s condition worsened. Respondent assumed that Patient A suffered from
anaphylaxis, ordered an intravenously administered Epinephrine 1:1000 concentration treatment,
resulting in an immediate blood pressure spike of greater than 200 systolic and a heart rate
exceeding 150 beats/minute.

6. On or about November 12, 2012, Patient A immediately became confused and
disoriented. Emergency Medical Transport was called and Patient A was transferred to St. Rose
Dominican Hospital-Siena Campus. Upon arrival, Patient A continued to be disoriented, his blood
pressure was 93/28, the blood work showed Troponin level elevated at 6.45 and the EKG showed
ST depression - all of which are consistent with a myocardial injury. The ER physician diagnosis
was cardiogenic shock, and Patient A was subsequently admitted into the Intensive Care Unit.

7. On or about November 15, 2012, Patient A was discharged.

8. The IME’s report stated: i) reasonable medical care would have understood that the
concentration of Epinephrine used was not intended for intravenous delivery as it is clearly stated
on the package insert for the 1:1000 strength of Epinephrine that it should not be used
intravenously or serious hypertension cardiomyopathy and other conditions associated with severe
hypertensive crisis could result; ii) due to Respondent’s administration of the medication by
intravenous delivery, Patient A suffered a hypertensive crisis resulting in myocardial injury

causing cardiogenic shock and encephalopathy; iit) the 1:1000 strength Epinephrine is intended

for anaphylaxis and is to be administered subcutaneously; and, iv) Respondent failed to appreciate
the gravity of the consequences of administering this concentration of Epinephrine intravenously,
and, therefore, fell below the standard of care.

9. The IME’s summary stated the following: i) Patient A suffered an event while at
the Urgent Care that can be directly correlated to the intravenous administration of the 1:1000
Epinephrine ordered by Respondent; ii) it should be noted that the 1:1000 Epinephrine is an
appropriate treatment for anaphylaxis, which Patient A appeared to be experiencing, however, the
route that this medication was given was contraindicated according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations, which are clearly stated on the bottle; iii) if Epinephrine is to be administered,
it should be the 1:10,000 strength and only in cardiac arrest; and, iv) Epinephrine and other
pressors can be used in the ICU setting intravenously as these solutions are very dilute and given
slow, intravenous drip monitored continuously.

10. Based upon the foregoing, the IC charges Respondent with the following violation
of the Medical Practice Act.

COUNTI
(Malpractice - NRS 630.301(4))

11. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set
forth herein.

12. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice, as defined in NAC 630.040, means the
failure of a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge
ordinarily used under similar circumstances, is grounds for discipline.

13. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent
committed malpractice in the course of providing care and treatment to Patient A when he failed
to perform the proper procedure when administering the Epinephrine by intravenous delivery;
Patient A, consequently, suffered a hypertensive crisis resulting myocardial injury causing
cardiogenic shock and encephalopathy, because Respondent failed to appreciate the gravity of the
consequences of administering his 1:1000 concentration of Epinephrine intravenously, and,

therefore, fell below the reasonable standard of care.

14. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

3. That the Board determine the sanctions it will impose if it finds Respondent
violated the Medical Practice Act;

4, That the Board make, issue and serve upon the Respondent, in writing, its findings
of fact, conclusions of law and order, which shall include the sanctions imposed; and

5. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these

premises.
