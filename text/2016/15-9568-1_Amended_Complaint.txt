The Investigative Committee' (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(Board) hereby issues this formal Amended Complaint (Complaint) against John Wert Van Horn,
M.D. (Respondent), a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a
reasonable basis to believe that the Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised
Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively,
the Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 6295), and has been
so licensed by the Board since September 17, 1988, and, at all times alleged herein, Respondent
was licensed in an active status by the Board pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice
Act.

2. On June 11, 2015, Respondent self-reported on his license renewal that he had been
charged with one felony count of attempted lewdness with a child under 14 years old pursuant to
NRS 193.330 in the Second Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada, Washoe County
(CR15-0720 — STATE OF NEVADA vs. JOHN WERT VAN HORN, II).

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners is composed of Board members
Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., Rachakonda Prabhu, M.D., and Ms. Sandy Peltyn.

3. On September 25, 2015, Respondent entered a plea of Guilty (See Exhibit 1,
Judgment of Conviction) and the aforementioned Court rendered judgment as follows: John Wert
Van Horn II is guilty of the crime of Attempted Lewdness With a Child Under the Age of

Fourteen Years, a violation of NRS 193.330”, being an attempt to violate NRS 201 203°, a felony,

2NRS 193.330 Punishment for attempts.

i. An act done with the intent to commit a crime, and tending but failing to accomplish it, is an attempt to
commit that crime. A person who attempts to commit a crime, unless a different penalty is prescribed by statute, shall
be punished as follows:

(a) If the person is convicted of:

(1) Attempt to commit a category A felony, for a category B felony by imprisonment in the state prison for a
minimum term of not less than 2 years and a maximum term of not more than 20 years.

(2) Attempt to commit a category B felony for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by
statute is greater than 10 years, for a category B felony by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not
less than 1 year and a maximum term of not more than 10 years.

(3) Attempt to commit a category B felony for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by
statute is 10 years or less, for a category C felony as provided in NRS 193.130.

(4) Attempt to commit a category C felony, for a category D felony as provided in NRS 193.130, or for a
gross misdemeanor by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 364 days, or by a fine of not more than
$2,000, or by both fine and imprisonment.

(5) Attempt to commit a category D felony, for a category E felony as provided in NRS 193.130, or for a
gross misdemeanor by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 364 days, or by a fine of not more than
$2,000, or by both fine and imprisonment.

(6) Attempt to commit a category E felony, for a category E felony as provided in NRS 193.130, or for a
gross misdemeanor by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 364 days, or by a fine of not more than
$2,000, or by both fine and imprisonment.

(b) If the person is convicted of attempt to commit a misdemeanor, a gross misdemeanor or a felony for which a
category is not designated by statute, by imprisonment for not more than one-half the longest term authorized by
statute, or by a fine of not more than one-half the largest sum, prescribed upon conviction for the commission of the
offense attempted, or by both fine and imprisonment.

2. Nothing in this section protects people who, in an unsuccessful attempt to commit one crime, does commit
another and different one, from the punishment prescribed for the crime actually committed. A person may be
convicted of an attempt to commit a crime, although it appears on the trial that the crime was consummated, unless
the court in its discretion discharges the jury and directs the defendant to be tried for the crime itself.

[1911 C&P § 26; RL § 6291; NCL § 9975]—(NRS A 1981, 158; 1995, 1168; 1997, 1178; 2013, 977)

NRS 201.230 Lewdness with child under 14 years; penalties.
1. A person who willfully and lewdly commits any lewd or lascivious act, other than acts constituting the crime
of sexual assault, upon or with the body, or any part or member thereof, of a child under the age of 14 years, with the
intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of that person or of that child, is
guilty of lewdness with a child.

2. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 3, a person who commits lewdness with a child is guilty of a
category A felony and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life with the possibility of parole,
with eligibility for parole beginning when a minimum of 10 years has been served, and may be further punished by a
fine of not more than $10,000.

3. A person who commits lewdness with a child and who has been previously convicted of:

(a) Lewdness with a child pursuant to this section or any other sexual offense against a child; or

(b) An offense committed in another jurisdiction that, if committed in this State, would constitute lewdness with a
child pursuant to this section or any other sexual offense against a child,
is guilty of a category A felony and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life without the
possibility of parole.

4. For the purpose of this section, “other sexual offense against a child” has the meaning ascribed to it in
subsection 5 of NRS 200.366.
