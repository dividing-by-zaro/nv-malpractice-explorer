4, On or about June 2, 2009, Respondent was to perform an orbital advancement
(hereinafter, the Procedure) for the repair of cranial synostosis on Patient A, who had a

PATIENT B

9. Patient B was a child less than six (6) months old at the time of the events at issue.
Her true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

10. On or about March 11, 2009, Respondent evaluated Patient B, diagnosed left
coronal synostosis (hereinafter, Patient B’s Condition), and referred Patient B to Dr. Stuart
Kaplan.

11. On or about August 17, 2009, Patient B underwent surgery and Dr. Stuart Kaplan’s
operative note indicates that a bifrontal craniotomy was performed by Dr. Kaplan and that the
Respondent performed the orbital advancement.

12. On or about August 17, 2009, Respondent did not do an operative report indicating
what medical treatment Respondent provided to Patient B.

13. On or about September 21, 2010, a new CT brain scan (CT) was performed
because Patient B presented to Respondent a familial macrocrania (abnormally large head)
condition.

14. This new CT revealed evidence that a unilateral craniotomy, not a bifrontal, as
dictated by Dr. Stuart Kaplan’s operative note, was performed by Dr. Kaplan, and, there is no
evidence of the orbital advancement performed by Respondent on this September 21, 2010 CT.

15. On or about September 25, 2009 thru November 8, 2010, Respondent failed to
provide any recommendation for additional corrective measures when there was not suitable
growth of the cranial regarding Patient B’s Condition during Respondent’s medical review of
Patient B’s Condition on subsequent evaluations conducted by Respondent on August 31, 2009,
October 1, 2009, June 1, 2010, and on November 8, 2010.

16. On or about, September 25, 2009 thru November 8, 2010, Respondent failed to
provide adequate follow-up surveillance and repeat assessments to make sure the Procedure was
adequate for Patient A’s Condition on subsequent evaluations conducted by Respondent on
August 31, 2009, October 1, 2009, June 1, 2010 and November 8, 2010.

17. On or about September 25, 2009 thru November 8, 2010, Respondent failed to
identify and/or recognize the inadequacy of the initial Procedure or to make additional plans for
intervention for Patient B’s Condition on subsequent evaluations conducted by Respondent on
August 31, 2009, October 1, 2009, June 1, 2010 and November 8, 2010, which is below the
standard of care.

18. On or about September 25, 2009 thru November 8, 2010, Respondent did not
document the cranial measurements of Patient B’s macrocrania medical condition and did not seek
the input from an ophthalmologist to insure there was no increased intracranial pressure.

19, On or about September 25, 2009 thru November 8, 2010, Respondent should have
seen that Patient B’s cranial deformity was progressing as a consequence of the inadequate initial
surgical procedure (the unilateral craniotomy), as 1t was suboptimal.

20. On or about September 25, 2009 thru November 8, 2010, Respondent should have
provided follow-up care regarding Patient B’s medical condition subsequent to the initial surgery
conducted on August 17, 2009.

21. On or about September 25, 2009 thru November 8, 2010, Respondent’s overall
management of Patient B fall below the standard of care based upon the probability that the CT
scan findings did not indicate that the Respondent performed the full procedure as dictated.

22. Based upon the foregoing, the IC charges Respondent with the following violations
of the Medical Practice Act.
