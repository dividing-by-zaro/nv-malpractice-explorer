COMPLAINT ~~

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board) hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Ali Dana, M.D. (Respondent), a
licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a reasonable basis to
believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630!
and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in an inactive status (License No. 13550), and has
been licensed by the Board since June 9, 2010 pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice
Act.

2. Previous to the preparation of this Complaint, the Board solicited the services of an
independent medical expert (IME), a nephrologist, to review the conduct of the Respondent and
render an opinion regarding whether Respondent through his acts and omissions violated the
Medical Practice Act.

3. At the time of the incidents alleged herein, Patient was being treated by

Respondent. Her true identity is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but her

identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this
Complaint.

4, On January 7, 2012, at approximately 3:00 a.m., Patient ingested a bottle of Aspirin
(ASA). After approximately four to six (4-6) hours of nausea and vomiting, finally resulting in
black vomitus, Patient notified her mother and was driven to the hospital.

5. On January 7, 2012, at approximately 10:00-10:30 a.m., Patient was seen in triage,
and she was under the care of another physician.

6. On January 7, 2012, Respondent, a nephrologist, treated Patient, between 12:35
and 1:00 p.m., when he was assigned to the case and notified that he was the admitting and the
consulting physician for Patient following a case discussion with the emergency room (ER)
physician.

7. On January 7, 2012, at 12:42 p.m., Patient’s ASA level was drawn pursuant to the
ER physician order. The results of this test were called to Respondent.

8. On January 7, 2012, at 5:06 p.m., Patient was seen and examined by Respondent,
who did not write orders as to when the blood work was to be drawn, did not write orders
requesting that Patient’s arterial blood gas (ABG) be measured, did not write orders regarding the
timing for repeated measurements of the Patients ABG, did not write a start time for the blood
draws to measure the Patient’s ASA levels, did not write orders for electrolyte determination or
updated assessment of renal function and did not write orders to follow fluid intake or output.

9. On January 7, 2012, at 5:50 p.m., Respondent was notified of Patient’s respiratory
difficulties and then Respondent ordered the contracted dialysis nurse from Davita be called to the
hospital to provide hemodialysis. He also ordered the “on-call” nephrologist to place a femoral
vein dialysis catheter. Respondent also informed this nephrologist of the need for immediate
dialysis. The on-call nephrologist confirmed the need for immediate dialysis. The Patient’s blood
pressure was not recorded.

10. On January 7, 2012, at 6:15 p.m., another physician (not the Respondent) ordered
intravenous (IV) Ativan and Haldol be administered to the Patient to address the Patient’s level of

anxiety and distress.

11. On January 7, 2012, at 7:52 p.m., IV blood pressure lowering medications were
given, but once again, no blood pressure recordings were found in the Patient’s chart.

12. On January 7, 2012, at 8:00 p.m., the contracted dialysis nurse from Davita arrived
to perform the hemodialysis approximately two and a half hours (2.5 hrs.) after Respondent
initially ordered dialysis.

13. On January 7, 2012, at 8:15 p.m., Patient was experiencing asystolic cardiac arrest
and coded; at 9:18 p.m., the Patient was declared dead.

14, The Board’s IME found that Respondent’s care and treatment of Patient constituted
malpractice. He stated that despite the fact that Respondent was a consulting physician, he was
the “captain of the ship” in the management of compiex intoxications involving fluid, electrolytes
and kidney considerations for Patient.

15. The IME opined that a nephrologist needs to pay attention to detail and must
frequently personally monitor the patient to ensure all bases are covered. Respondent failed to act
asthe “captain of the ship” for Patient care and treatment.

16. The IME opined that “the standard of care would be that once Respondent was
contacted and ‘case discussed’ that his involvement began and that all orders from that point
forward were part of his responsibility, including review and modification (if indicated) of prior
orders.”

17. The IME opined that there should have been an order for strict monitoring of intake
and output of body fluids to guide and assess fluid volume status to prevent fluid overload.

18, The IME opined that there should have been orders for frequent blood electrolyte
levels so abnormalities or sub-optimal levels could be corrected.

19. The IME opined that potassium replacement should have been started much earlier.

29. The IME opined that more frequent ABGs should have been performed to allow
regulation of medication to achieve the desired target levels of pH of over 7.5 to.enhance removal
of ASA by the kidneys. |

21. The IME opined that more frequent blood ASA levels should have been performed

to allow careful tracking as to the progress of ASA removal from the system.
