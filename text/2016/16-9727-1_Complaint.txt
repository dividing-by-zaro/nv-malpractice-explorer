COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee' (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(Board) hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Robert Bien, M.D.
(Respondent), a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the
Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 5658), and has been
so licensed by the Board since July 1, 1988. At all times alleged herein, Respondent was licensed
in an active status by the Board pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice Act.

2. All medical records of the patients (A & B) treated by Respondent were provided
by Respondent pursuant to a Board Subpoena.

3. Previous to the preparation of this Complaint, the Board solicited the services of an
independent medical expert (IME) to review the medical records of Patients A &
B and render an opinion regarding whether Respondent, through his acts and omissions, violated

the Medical Practice Act.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners composed of Board members
Beverly A Neyland, M.D., Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D., and Sandy Peltyn.

Patient A

4. On or about September 1, 2011, Patient A presented to Respondent complaining of
severe chronic pain secondary to multiple medical conditions, including seven (7) failed back
surgeries. Patient A had an Intrathecal (IT) drug delivery system, originally placed in 2000, and
this was replaced in March of 2011. This pump had originally provided Patient A with pain
control, yet after the replacement, Patient A’s pain become much more uncontrollable.
Respondent investigated the Pump with a rotor and dye study and a break in the catheter was
found. An IT pump revision was indicated given these findings

5. On or about September 2, 2011, Patient A complained of right leg and axial spine
pain, but was able to ambulate with a walker to the procedure. The pump revision procedure was
complicated by inadvertent placement of the catheter needle into the spinal cord. This procedure
was aborted and Patient A was transferred to the hospital for evaluation. Patient A was found to
have a new onset left leg numbness and weakness. MRI findings were consistent with a thoracic
spinal cord injury. Patient A continued to have paraplegia and was eventually sent to a
rehabilitation hospital, where she was unable to ambulate at all and was wheelchair-bound from
that point on and she passed approximately one year later, around September 3, 2012.

6. On or about September 2, 2011, Respondent did not have any intraoperative
images available for Patient A. Respondent, during all past and similar procedures, attached
fluoroscopic images, except for Patient A’s specific procedure. Patient A experienced a
significant spinal cord injury from the catheter needle. This procedure is typically performed by
advancing a catheter needle in the lumbar region to avoid spinal cord contact/injury. There is no
documentation as to why Respondent placed the catheter in the thoracic region when it could have
been placed easily in the lumbar region and no documentation indicating where exactly
Respondent placed the catheter needle in Patient A’s back.

7. On or about April 25, 2015, the Board’s IME opined that Respondent performed
sub-standard care by not clearly documenting the reasons for placing a thoracic intrathecal
catheter and not saving any intraoperative imaging results for the medical record, and, thus

committed malpractice.

Patient B

8. On or about December 2011, Patient B presented to Respondent with a new
vertebral compression fracture secondary to severe osteoporosis and was eager to have a
vertebroplasty procedure repeated. Respondent had taken care of Patient B with significant
comorbid medical conditions for years and had performed the verteboplasty procedure on the
patient several times previously with positive outcomes.

9, On or about January 6, 2012, Patient B, who was ambulatory with a walker and had
previously documented neurological examinations that did not show any focal lower extremity
weakness, underwent a T5 vertebroplasty, which generally requires a neurological examination,
and Respondent’s procedure notes state that the aforementioned procedure was uncomplicated and
that there was no evidence of bone cement extravasation and the plan was to follow-up with
Patient B in two (2) weeks. No documentation was provided that Respondent saw Patient B prior
to her discharge. Pursuant to the nursing records, Patient B arrived in post-anesthesia recovery
with a non-functioning IV and in extreme pain, “crying & yelling,” hypertensive (215/120), and
was given two doses of Demerol and three dosages of Labetalol while in the recovery room. After
three hours in the recovery room, Patient B was discharged by wheelchair, unable to ambulate
with a walker, and the discharge instructions did not give advice regarding what to do if there was
new neurological deficit.

10. On or about January 9, 2012, Patient B communicated with Respondent’s office
(POD #3) and was instructed to go to an emergency room for her complaints. On the CT
examination, Patient B was found to have bone cement in the spinal canal, which caused new
profound numbness and weakness in her lower extremity.

11. On or about January 11, 2012, Patient B underwent decompressive thoracic
laminectomy surgery as she had suffered a serious spinal cord injury.

12. On or about January 2013, Patient B was deceased.

13. On or about April 25, 2015, the Board’s IME opined that Patient B’s hypertension
and pain could have been the first signs of a spinal cord injury. In that situation, a neurological

exam would be important to perform before allowing Patient B to leave the facility, and if an

exam had been performed by Respondent, then he may have noticed that his patient had a focal
neurological deficit and investigated it further with imaging and neurosurgical consultation. It is
possible that an early decompression may have avoided this injury, and, thus Respondent
committed malpractice with regard to Patient B’s care.

14. Based upon the foregoing, the IC charges Respondent with the following violations
of the Medical Practice Act.

COUNT I

(NRS 630.3062(1): Failure to Maintain Proper Medical Records - Patient A)

medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A, who received thoracic
intrathecal catheter treatment from the Respondent, who did not save any intraoperative imaging
results for the medical record.

18. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT I
(NRS 630.301(4) Malpractice - Patient A)

19. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
