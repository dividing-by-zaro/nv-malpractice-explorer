is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation served
upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4. The expert’s review of Patient A’s medical record concluded that Respondent
violated the standard of care in the treatment of Patient A’s persistent, nonmalignant cervical,
thoracic, and lumbar back pain condition by failing to do a meaningful physical exam, order
diagnostic testing, document responses or side effects to prescribed pain medication or test for
medication toxicity.

5. On or about March 29, 2012, Patient A, with a widely fluctuating, elevated blood
pressure (170/110), was seen by the Respondent, who did not perform any medication adjustment
in Patient A’s Lisinopril (20/25mg) dosage. Respondent did not make any comments or
documentation regarding Patient A’s elevated blood pressure, did no patient counseling, did no
recheck of the blood pressure, did no laboratory tests and performed no EKG.

6. On or about December 11, 2012, Patient A, with the complaint of persistent
nonmalignant cervical, thoracic and lumbar back pain was seen by the Respondent, who did not
perform any examination of Patient A’s back or spine; and did not perform a neurological exam,
which usually includes assessment of the strength of the affected body part, evaluation of
sensation and deep tendon reflexes.

7. On or about December 11, 2012, Respondent failed to provide any treatment and
evaluation of Patient’s A back pain, which should have included a review of Patient A’s medical
history, a review of symptoms, and the required examinations; Respondent failed to provide
adequate follow-up surveillance and repeat assessments regarding Patient A’s medical conditions
on subsequent evaluations conducted by Respondent, and, no referrals were made to appropriate
specialists, such a physical therapist or pain management specialist for further non-narcotic
treatment (epidural, steroids, TENS), an orthopedist or a neurologist.

8. On or about May 31, 2013, Patient A, with the complaint of a chronic cough, was

seen by the Respondent, who prescribed Phenergan with Codeine Elixir (#160z.) without

evaluating Patient A’s chest with an X-ray, conducting the necessary blood work, or conducting
an upper endoscopy or pulmonary function test to evaluate for emphysema, asthma, or gastric
reflux as causes of Patient A’s chronic cough.

9. On or about May 31, 2013, Respondent’s examinations of Patient’s A chest
indicated that Patient A’s lung was “clear” yet Respondent continued to prescribe large amounts
of narcotic cough syrup each month in addition to the large amounts of narcotics Patient A was
taking for his chronic back pain, and Respondent did not attempt to diagnose the etiology of
Patient A’s chronic cough.

10. Based upon the aforementioned, Respondent violated the standard of care in
treating Patient A, and, engaged in malpractice when Respondent failed to use the reasonable care,
skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

76. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice, as defined in NAC 630.040, means the
failure of a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge
ordinarily used under similar circumstances, is grounds for discipline.

77. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent

committed malpractice when he failed to exercise reasonable care, skill or knowledge regarding
Patient A’ s cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine pain, shoulder and knee pain when Respondent:
i) failed to do an examination of Patient’s back, shoulder and knee by conducting an evaluation of
the aforementioned pain, including the Patient’s history and review of systems, ii) failed to do a
neurological examination that should have included an examination of the affected body part and
to assess for the presence and the severity of neurologic deficits, and, iii) failed to properly
document any type of examination regarding Patient’s condition; thus, Respondent violated the
standard of care” for the treatment and evaluation of Patient A’s pain from three (3) different body
locations.

78. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent
committed malpractice when he failed to exercise reasonable care, skill or knowledge regarding
Patient A’s hypertension (high blood pressure) when Respondent: i) provided no medication
adjustment to Patient A’s Lisinopril (20/25mg), ii) provided no comment regarding this elevated
blood pressure, no patient counseling, no recheck of the blood pressure, and, iii) performed no
laboratory tests or EKG. Thus, Respondent violated the standard of care’ for the treatment and
evaluation of Patient A’s widely fluctuating blood pressures.

79. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent
committed malpractice when he failed to exercise reasonable care, skill or knowledge regarding
Patient A’s cough by prescribing a potent narcotic medication without a diagnosis or physical
examination of Patient A’s upper body and cough; thus, Respondent violated the standard of care
for the treatment and evaluation of Patient A’s cough.
