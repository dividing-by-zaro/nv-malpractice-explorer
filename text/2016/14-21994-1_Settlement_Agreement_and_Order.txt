notwithstanding rejection of this Agreement by the Board, nothing contained in this Agreement

expenses or fees owed to the Board, is a failure to comply with an order of the Board, which may
result in additional disciplinary action being taken against Respondent. NRS 630.3065(2)(a).

condition of this Agreement may subject Respondent to civil collection efforts.
