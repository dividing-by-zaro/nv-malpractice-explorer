SECOND ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION

DAVID LYNN PACKER, M._D.,

Respondent.


Prior to the preparation of this Order of Summary Suspension, Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners’ (Board) staff presented evidence and information to an Investigative
Committee (IC) of the Board, composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, regarding
David Lynn Packer, M.D. (Dr. Packer). Upon review of the evidence and information presented
by Board staff, the IC hereby IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDS Dr. Packer’s license to practice
medicine in the state of Nevada pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 630.326(1), based
upon the following preliminary findings:

1. Dr. Packer is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada and
was originally licensed on January 28, 2009. Dr. Packer practices medicine in the Las Vegas area
and his specialties listed with the Board are Plastic Surgery, Family Practice and Urgent Care.

2. Dr. Packer was served with an Order for Evaluation by the IC on April 18, 2013,
setting an evaluation of Dr. Packer for April 30, 2013, at 11:15 a.m., with Melissa Piasecki, M.D.,
at her office located at 1135 Terminal Way, Suite 106, Reno, Nevada 89502.

3. Dr. Packer failed to appear at the evaluation as ordered by the IC.

4, Pursuant to NRS 630.318(3), the failure of Dr. Packer to submit to the evaluation
constitutes an admission of the charges against him.

As a result of the foregoing, the IC reasonably determines and believes that due to
Dr. Packer’s failure to comply with its request for an evaluation, the health, safety and welfare of
the public is at imminent risk of harm and that summary suspension of Dr. Packer’s license to
practice medicine is necessary to remove said risk of imminent harm to the health, safety and
welfare of the public.

Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
of David Lynn Packer, M.D. (License No. 13014) is HEREBY SUSPENDED until further order
of the IC or Board; and,

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing is set for July 23, 2013 at 9:00 a.m. at the
Board offices in Reno, Nevada, pursuant to NRS 630.326(2), to determine whether this suspension
may continue, unless the parties mutually agree to a divergent time frame.

DATED this i? day of June, 2013.
