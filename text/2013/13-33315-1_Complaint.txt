Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, by and

3. On or about December 10, 2009, Patient A was admitted with frequent contractions
to Summerlin Hospital for preeclampsia workup and the administration of betamethasone for fetal
lung maturity.

4, Patient A was an in-patient at Summerlin Hospital from December 10, 2009
through January 5, 2010. She was being treated for antepartum management of preterm labor
contractions, preeclampsia and monitoring of her triplets growth and fetal well-being.

5. On or about January 5, 2010, at approximately 2:45 am., Patient A was
diaphoretic, pale and experiencing severe pain and pressure in her abdomen and pelvis.

6. On or about January 5, 2010, at approximately 7:05 a.m., the fetal monitors were
nonreactive for all three (3) fetuses and tachycardic at times for Babies B and C. From
approximately 7:28 A.M. until 10:18 a.m., Baby A was not tracing and Baby A’s heart rate was
absent variability with no and/or late decelerations. At approximately 7:45 a.m. and 8:20 a.m.,
Baby B was not tracing. At approximately 8:30 a.m., the status of the fetal heart rates for all three
(3) babies was changed from Category 1 to Category II.

7. On January 5, 2010, at approximately 9:07 a.m., nursing staff left a voice message
for Respondent regarding Patient A, which was not returned. At approximately 9:28 a.m., nursing
staff again telephoned Respondent. Respondent was informed of Patient A’s status and was
advised that she should assess Patient A as soon as possible.

8. On January 5, 2010, from approximately 9:12 a.m. until 10:18 am., Baby A was
not tracing.

9. At approximately 9:58 a.m. on January 5, 2010, Respondent ordered Patient A
undergo a cesarean section. Respondent, however, could not immediately perform the cesarean
section because she was waiting for the arrival of her surgical assistant. At approximately
10:45 a.m., Patient A was taken to the operating room for a cesarean section.

10. At approximately 11:13 a.m. on January 5, 2010, Baby A was delivered with
severely depressed Apgar scores requiring resuscitation. Evidence of a placental abruption was
discovered in Baby A’s amniotic sac. As a result, Baby A suffered permanent mental and

physical damage.

11. Respondent entered numerous untimed and/or illegible entries into Patient A’s
chart. Respondent also failed to document that he re-evaluated Patient A or the fetal monitor
recordings after 4:00 a.m. on January 5, 2010.

12. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

13. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

14. | Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a
physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

15. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when she, as outlined above and among other things, failed to
recognize the significance of the recorded fetal tachycardia, absent variability, and recurring late
decelerations, which represented a significant change in the fetal heart rate pattern, and failed to
provide corrective measures for the fetuses. Respondent also failed to use the reasonable care,
skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when he ordered the fetal monitors
removed despite the presence of late decelerations and non-reactive tracing in the fetuses.

16. | Respondent also failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily
used under similar circumstances when he, as outlined above and among other things, failed to
communicate with Dr. Vo regarding Patient A’s status.

17, By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

19, NRS 630.3062(1) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate and
complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds for
initiating discipline against a licensee.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
