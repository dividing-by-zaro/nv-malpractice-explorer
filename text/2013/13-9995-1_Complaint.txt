3. On or about December 28, 2010, January 6, 2011, and February 17, 2011, Patient
A was treated by Respondent. On each date, Respondent noted in the patient’s chart that the
patient had an implanted defibrillator.

4. On or about April 14, 2011, Respondent performed a Radiofrequency Ablation
(RFA) procedure on Patient A. The pre-procedure history and physical for Patient A, which was
filled out by Respondent on the day of RFA procedure, does not mention the patient’s
defibrillator.

5. Prior to performing the RFA procedure, Respondent did not deactivate Patient A’s
defibrillator. During the procedure, Patient A’s defibrillator was activated on two separate
occasions.

6. As a result of the defibrillator being activated on two separate occasions during the
RFA procedure, Patient A experienced undue anguish and physical pain.

7. Further, Respondent’s medical records for Patient A are inaccurate, incomplete,
illegible and/or untimely. For example, the medical records do not demonstrate that Respondent
attempted to contact or did contact Patient A’s cardiologist prior to or immediately following the
RFA procedure. The medical records do not demonstrate that Respondent conducted a pre-
procedure evaluation of Patient A to screen for contraindications to the procedure.

COUNT I
(Medical Records Violation)

8. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set
forth herein.
9. NRS 630.3062(1) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate and

complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds for
initiating discipline against a licensee.

10. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to maintain accurate and/or complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care
of Patient A when he wrote incomplete, inaccurate, untimed and/or illegible entries in Patient A’s

chart.
