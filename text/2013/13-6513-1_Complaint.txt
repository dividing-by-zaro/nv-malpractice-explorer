3. On or about June 5, 2008, Patient A presented to the emergency department at
Spring Valley Hospital after sustaining a gunshot wound to his right leg. X-rays revealed Patient
A’s fibula and tibia were fractured. Respondent was the on-call orthopedic surgeon for Spring
Valley Hospital on said date. Respondent performed an open reduction internal fixation (ORIF)
procedure to repair Patient A’s fractured fibula and tibia.

4. During the procedure, Respondent placed an intramedullary rod in Patient’s A’s
right leg and placed two cerclage wires around the fracture.

5. On or about June 5, 2008, after the completion of the procedure, x-rays were taken
of Patient A’s right leg. The x-rays evidenced that the intramedullary rod was approximately one
centimeter to one-and-one-half centimeters too long for Patient A’s leg.

6. As a result of the placement of an improperly sized intramedullary rod and/or the
two cerclage wires, Patient A suffered, among other things, a defect in the femoral condyle,
underwent corrective surgery, and underwent prolonged rehabilitation.

7. Further, Respondent’s medical records for Patient A are inaccurate, incomplete,
illegible and/or untimely.

COUNT I
(Medical Records Violation)

8. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set
forth herein.
9, NRS 630.3062(1) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate and

initiating discipline against a licensee.

10. Respondent failed to maintain accurate and/or complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A when he wrote incomplete, inaccurate, untimed
and/or illegible entries in Patient A’s chart.

11. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
