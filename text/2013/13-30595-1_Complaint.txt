(Board), composed at the time of filing this Complaint of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Ms. Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, by
and through Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., Board General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a

stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1, Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 11502), and was so
licensed on July 8, 2005, by the Board pursuant to the Medical Practice Act. Respondent’s
specialty listed with the Board is Internal Medicine.

2. Patient A was a forty-nine (49)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but her
identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with this
Complaint.

3. Patient B was a fifty (50)-year-old male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect his identity, but his identity is
disclosed in the Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with this
Complaint.

4. Patient C was a forty-eight (48)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but her
identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with this
Complaint.

5. Patient D was a fifty-one (51)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but her
identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with this
Complaint.

6. Patient E was a former employee and patient. Since no records exist for her
treatment, her age is currently unknown. Her true identity is not disclosed in this Complaint to
protect her identity, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation contemporaneously
served on Respondent with this Complaint.

7. At all times referenced herein, Respondent was the supervising physician of
Angela Lorenzo, P.A.-C (Ms. Lorenzo). Despite this, Ms. Lorenzo ran the Modern Medical and
Wellness Clinic (Modern Medical), located at 7190 Smoke Ranch Road, Suite 110, Las Vegas,
Nevada, exclusively by herself.

8. Ms. Lorenzo treated Patient A from approximately April 2010 to August 2010.
During the course of treatment, Ms. Lorenzo repeatedly prescribed and/or administered
medications without appropriate medical justification(s). Ms. Lorenzo also frequently
administered parenteral medications that were not medically indicated. Ms. Lorenzo also
compromised Patient A’s safety by prescribing excessive thyroid hormone.

9. Ms. Lorenzo treated Patient B from approximately April 2010 to August 2010.
During the course of treatment, Ms. Lorenzo repeatedly prescribed and/or administered

medications without appropriate medical justification(s). | Ms. Lorenzo also frequently
administered parenteral medications that were not medically indicated.

10. Ms. Lorenzo treated Patient C from approximately February 2010 to June 2011.
During the course of treatment, Ms. Lorenzo repeatedly prescribed and/or administered
medications without appropriate medical justification(s). Ms. Lorenzo also frequently
administered parenteral medications that were not medically indicated.

11. Ms. Lorenzo treated Patient D from approximately September 2010 to November
2010. During the course of treatment, Ms. Lorenzo repeatedly prescribed and/or administered
medications without appropriate medical justification(s). Ms. Lorenzo also frequently
administered parenteral medications that were not medically indicated.

12, Ms. Lorenzo treated Patient E intermittently while she was an employee of Modern
Medical. During the course of treatment, Ms. Lorenzo repeatedly prescribed and/or administered
medications without appropriate medical justification(s). Ms. Lorenzo also frequently
administered parenteral medications that were not medically indicated.

13. Thus, for Patients A-E, Ms. Lorenzo provided improper patient care that should
have prompted intervention by Respondent. The records reflect an absence of citations for
unnecessary medical testing and procedures. Additionally, multiple testing and procedures took
place that are inappropriate for the listed diagnosis, care and/or treatment of Patients A-E.
Further, there is an absence of medical decision making in the records. Finally, the medical
records are very hard to follow and much information is contradictory to other records in the same
patient file.

14. — Additionally, Ms. Lorenzo used and dispensed, on multiple occasions, expired
medications on her patients.

15. On or about August 17, 2012, Ms. Lorenzo’s dispensing license with the State
Board of Pharmacy, License Number PD12166, was suspended based upon multiple allegations of
improper use of such dispensing license.

16. As the supervising physician, Respondent also failed to spend the required amount

of time at Modern Medical.
