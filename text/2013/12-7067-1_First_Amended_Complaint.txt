MAURICE DuBOIS GREGORY, JR., M.D., NOV 21 2013
NMeDIy STATE BOARD OF

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(Board), comprised of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman, Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU,
LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, by and through its counsel,
Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., General Counsel, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Maurice DuBois Gregory, Jr., M.D., (Respondent) has violated the provisions of Nevada Revised
Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630, and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 630, the Medical Practice
Act ("MPA"), hereby issues its First Amended Complaint, stating the IC's charges and allegations,
as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 4894), and has been
so licensed by the Board since July 9, 1983 pursuant to the provisions of the MPA.

2. From 2004 to 2011, Respondent provided medical care, including diagnosis of
chronic pain and treatment of chronic pain, for Patients A-E. The medical care and treatment of
Patients A-E outlined below was a deviation from the applicable standard of care.

3. Relatedly, the MPA and related regulations establish standards of practice for the

treatment of pain and adopt by reference the "Model Guidelines’ for the Use of Controlled

' In 2004, the Federation of State Medical Boards changed the title of the guidelines to the "Model Policy for the Use
of Controlled Substances for the Treatment of Pain."

Substances for the Treatment of Pain" published by the Federation of State Medical Boards of the
United States, Inc. ("Model Policy"). This policy establishes adequate treatment policies for the
treatment of chronic pain, including the use of opioids. It establishes that physicians have a
responsibility to minimize the potential for abuse and diversion of controlled substances and to
follow related pain-treatment policies. Respondent, unfortunately, failed to follow the Model
Policy as to Patients A-E.

4, Patient A was a fifty-eight (58) -year-old male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity was disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of the Complaint.

5. Upon information and belief, Patient A sought medical care and treatment with
Respondent from August 10, 2007 to November 9, 2010 for back and shoulder pain.

6. On or about September 8, 2008, Patient A produced a negative Urine Drug Test
("UDT") for prescribed medications, controlled substances and/or illegal drugs, even though he
had been prescribed Oxycontin, 80 mg, 120 count, every thirty (30) days;
hydrocodone, 500 mg./7.5 mg., 120 count, every thirty (30) to sixty (60) days; and
Soma, 350 mg., 120 count, every thirty (30) days; for pain and muscle relaxing, by Respondent.
Patient A again had negative UDTs on or about February 22, 2009 and February 24, 2009. All the
while, Respondent was still prescribing the above-described Oxycontin, hydrocodone and Soma to
Patient A.

7. Under the standard of care, Patient A should have been discharged for the failed
UDTs, or at a minimum, should not have been prescribed more opioids.

8. Patient B was a fifty-nine (59)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity was disclosed in
the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of the Complaint.

9. Upon information and belief, Patient B sought medical care and treatment with
Respondent from March 12, 2007 to June 9, 2010 for right leg and hip pain.

10. Respondent routinely prescribed Patient B two (2) long-acting pain medications on
a monthly basis, Oxycontin, 80 mg. 180 count, every thirty (0) days; and
methadone, 10 mg., 120 count, every thirty (30) days. This was improper due to the extremely
long and variable half-life of methadone and its combination with the Oxycontin.

11. Under the standard of care, the Oxycontin and methadone should have never been
prescribed together, unless transitioning from one medication to the other.

12. Patient C was a twenty-three (23)-year-old male at the time of the incidents in
question. His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity was disclosed in
the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of the Complaint.

13. | Upon information and belief, Patient C sought medical care and treatment with
Respondent from September 4, 2008 to May 5, 2010 for pain and multiple conditions related to
incomplete quadriplegia.

14. Respondent improperly prescribed morphine, 100 mg., 90 count, every thirty (30)
days; and Oxycontin, 80 mg., 105 count, every 21 days; together, for Patient C. Under the
standard of care, the Oxycontin should have been tapered slowly while adding the morphine over a
period of weeks.

15. Patient D was a forty-two (42)-year-old male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity was disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of the Complaint.

16. | Upon information and belief, Patient D sought medical care and treatment with
Respondent from August, 2005 to September, 2005 for pain.

17. Respondent improperly prescribed Oxycontin, 120 mg., 30 count, every 15 days;
along with methadone, 40 mg., 30 count, every seven (7) days. Again, under the standard of care,
these two (2) long-acting medications should not have been prescribed together due to the variable
half-life of methadone and its combination with the Oxycontin.

18. Patient E was a fifty-four (54)-year-old male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity was disclosed in the

Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of the Complaint.

19. | Upon information and belief, Patient E sought medical care and treatment with
Respondent from January 13, 2004 to January 20, 2011 for leg, feet and back pain.

20. Respondent prescribed methadone, 10 mg., 120 count, every thirty (30) days, as a
"p.rn." (as needed) medication, along with Soma, 350 mg., 120 count, every thirty (30) days;
Oxycodone, 30 mg., 360 count, every forty (40) days; and hydrocodone with ibuprofen,
7.5/200 mg., 240 count, every thirty (30) days.

21. | Under the standard of care, Methadone should never be prescribed as a "p.r.n."
medication.

22. The medical records of Patients A-E appear to be incomplete and are often
illegible.
