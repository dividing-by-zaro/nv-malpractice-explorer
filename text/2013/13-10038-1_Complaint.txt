COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), composed at the time of filing of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, by and
through Erin L. Albright, Esq., Deputy General Counsel for the Board and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Van R. Bohman, M.D. (Respondent), violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively “Medical Practice Act”), hereby issues its formal Complaint,
stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 6760), and has been
licensed by the Board since June 5, 1993, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice Act.

2. At all times alleged herein, Patient A was a twenty-three (23) year old female
pregnant with triplets, Babies A — C. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed in this Complaint to
protect her identity, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation contemporaneously
served on Respondent with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On or about December 10, 2009, Patient A was admitted with frequent contractions
to Summerlin Hospital for preeclampsia workup and the administration of betamethasone for fetal
lung maturity.

4, Patient A was an in-patient at Summerlin Hospital from December 10, 2009
through January 5, 2010. She was being treated for antepartum management of preterm labor
contractions, preeclampsia and monitoring of her triplets growth and fetal well-being.

5. On or about January 5, 2010, at approximately 2:45 am., Patient A was
diaphoretic, pale and experiencing severe pain and pressure in her abdomen and pelvis.

6. On or about January 5, 2010, at approximately 4:00 a.m., Respondent performed a
biophysical profile (“BPP”) for each triplet, which was documented as eight (8) out of eight (8)
for each fetus. The fetal monitor indicated a lack of reactivity for Baby A and Baby B coupled
with the presence of late decelerations. The fetal monitor indicated that there was tachycardia in
Baby C. Despite the lack of reactivity for Babies A and B and the tachycardia in Baby C,
Respondent ordered the fetal monitors removed and reapplied at 6:00 a.m.

7, On or about January 5, 2010, at approximately 7:05 a.m., the fetal monitors were
nonreactive for all three (3) fetuses and tachycardic at times for Babies B and C. From
approximately 7:28 a.m. until 10:18 a.m., Baby A was not tracing and Baby A’s heart rate was
absent variability with no and/or late decelerations. At approximately 7:45 a.m. and 8:20 a.m.,
Baby B was not tracing. At approximately 8:30 a.m., the status of the fetal heart rates for all three
(3) babies was changed from Category | to Category II.

8. On January 5, 2010, at approximately 9:05 a.m., nursing staff telephonically
informed Respondent of Patient A’s condition. Respondent advised the nursing staff to telephone
Dr. Vo, Patient A’s primary care physician. At approximately 9:07 a.m., nursing staff left a voice
message for Dr. Vo regarding Patient A, which was not returned. At approximately 9:28 a.m.,
nursing staff again telephoned Dr. Vo. Dr. Vo was informed of Patient A’s status and was advised
that he should assess Patient A as soon as possible.

9. On January 5, 2010, from approximately 9:12 a.m. until 10:18 am., Baby A was

not tracing.

10. At approximately 9:58 a.m. on January 5, 2010, Dr. Vo ordered Patient A undergo
a cesarean section. Dr. Vo, however, could not immediately perform the cesarean section
because she was waiting for the arrival of her surgical assistant. At approximately 10:45 a.m.,
Patient A was taken to the operating room for a cesarean section.

11. At approximately 11:13 am. on January 5, 2010, Baby A was delivered with
severely depressed Apgar scores requiring resuscitation. Evidence of a placental abruption was
discovered in Baby A’s amniotic sac. As a result, Baby A suffered permanent mental and
physical damage.

12. Respondent entered numerous untimed and/or illegible entries into Patient A’s
chart. Respondent also failed to document that he re-evaluated Patient A or the fetal monitor
recordings after 4:00 a.m. on January 5, 2010.

COUNT I
(Malpractice)

13. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

14. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

15. Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a
physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

16. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when he, as outlined above, failed to recognize the significance of the
recorded fetal tachycardia, absent variability and recurring late decelerations, which represented a
significant change in the fetal heart rate pattern, and failed to provide corrective measures for the
fetuses. Respondent also failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when he ordered the fetal monitors removed despite the presence of
late decelerations and non-reactive tracing in the fetuses.

17. Respondent also failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily
used under similar circumstances when he, as outlined above, failed to communicate with Dr. Vo
regarding Patient A’s status.

18. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT I
(Records Violation)

19. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set
forth herein.

20. NRS 630.3062(1) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate and
complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds for
initiating discipline against a licensee.

21. Respondent failed to maintain accurate and/or complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A when he wrote numerous untimed and/or illegible
entries into Patient A’s medical records and/or failed to document that he re-evaluated Patient A
or the fetal monitor recordings after 4:00 A.M. on January 5, 2010.

22. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:
