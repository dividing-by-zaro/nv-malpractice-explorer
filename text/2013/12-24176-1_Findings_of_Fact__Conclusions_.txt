of the Board and the Nevada State Board of Dental Examiners located at 6010 S. Rainbow Boulevard,

The members of _ the Board _ participating in the decision were:

The Board, having received and read the Complaint and exhibits admitted in this matter, as well

transcript of the hearing held on December 12, 2012, proceeded to make a decision pursuant to the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapters 233B and 630.

Hl



The Board, after due consideration of the record, evidence and law, and being fully advised in
the premises, makes its FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ORDER in this

matter as follows:

FINDINGS OF FACT

I.

Respondent held a license to practice as a respiratory therapist in the state of Nevada at all
relevant times.

Il.

On July 9, 2012, the Investigative Committee (IC) filed a formal Complaint in this matter
alleging violations of Chapter 630 of the NRS and Chapter 630 of the Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC).

III.

On December 12, 2012, a hearing was held before an appointed hearing officer on the
allegations contained within Counts I, II, III, [V and V of the Complaint. Respondent was not present or
represented by counsel. The IC was represented by Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., General Counsel for the
Board.

IV.

Respondent was employed as a respiratory therapist at University Medical Center (UMC) in
Las Vegas, Nevada until November 2011. A UMC investigation uncovered that beginning sometime in
2006, Respondent documented treatments in the medical record that she did not actually provide to the
patients. Respondent documented therapy given by her, billed for the therapy, but then failed to remove
the prescribed medication from the drug repository to administer to the patients. Thus, Respondent left
the patients without the therapy and treatments that she documented and billed.

Respondent's misconduct was discovered by UMC before the end of 2011. Two hundred seven
(207) patients over a six (6)-plus year period from 2006 through 2011 were documented to have not
received the billed therapy and medications.


a



On or about November 3, 2011, Respondent's employment was terminated by UMC based upon
her admission of the misconduct.

V.

The Board finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent violated
NRS 630.305(1)(d) by charging for visits that did not occur or for services which were not rendered or
documented in the records of a patient.

VI.

The Board finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent violated NRS 630.3062(1)
by failing to maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of a patient.

VIL.

The Board finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent violated NAC 630.540(8)
by falsifying the records of health care.

VIII.

The Board finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent violated NAC 630.540(15)
by engaging in conduct that violates the trust of a patient and exploits the relationship between the
practitioner of respiratory care and the patient for financial or other personal gain.

IX.

The Board finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent violated NAC 630.540(16)

by engaging in conduct which brings the respiratory care profession into disrepute
X.
If any of the foregoing Findings of Fact is more properly deemed a Conclusion of Law, it may be

so construed.
