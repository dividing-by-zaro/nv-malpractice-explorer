3, On or about August 30, 2010, Patient A presented to the emergency department at
Renown Regional Medical Center (Renown) complaining of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. A
urinalysis was performed on Patient A. A different physician diagnosed Patient A with diarrhea
and vomiting. Patient A received a liter of normal saline bolus, Zofran and morphine and was
discharged.

4, On or about August 31, 2010, approximately seven (7) hours after her discharge
from Renown on August 30, 2010, Patient A returned to the emergency department at Renown
complaining of recent-onset right lower extremity pain. During this visit, Patient A was treated by
Respondent. During this visit, Respondent conducted a full-range of motion on Patient A’s right
lower extremity and noted the patient’s right lower extremity was not swollen or tender.
Respondent performed motor and sensory exams on Patient A. The results of these exams were
normal and symmetrical.

5. During this visit, Patient A was hypotensive and her heart rate was mildly
tachycardic. Respondent ordered and obtained lab work that showed multiple abnormalities,
including, but not limited to, a diminished platelet count of forty-eight (48); forty-eight percent
(48%) bands with moderate toxic granulation and few Dohle bodies; eighteen percent (18%)
metamyelocytes; elevated creatinine; decreased electrolytes; elevated liver transaminases and
elevated total bilirubin. After reviewing the results of the lab work, Respondent advised Patient A
to stop drinking alcohol, provided her with a prescription for Percodan and discharged the patient
home.

6. Approximately fifteen (15) hours after Respondent discharged Patient A from the
hospital, Patient A returned to the emergency department at Renown. At this time, Patient A had
developed leukopenia with evidence of multi-organ dysfunction and coagulopathy. Patient A was
subsequently diagnosed with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome secondary to a retained tampon.

7. Further, Respondent’s medical records for Patient A are inaccurate, incomplete,
illegible and/or untimely. For example, Patient A’s medical records lack documentation
demonstrating that Respondent reviewed Patient A’s medical records from her August 30, 2010

emergency room visit.
