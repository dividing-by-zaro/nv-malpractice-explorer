3. On or about January 7, 2011, Patient A presented to the emergency department at
St. Rose Siena Hospital on referral from her primary care physician with complaints of heavy
vaginal bleeding for three (3) days duration. Patient A was referred to the emergency department
of St. Rose Siena Hospital by her primary care physician for a suspected ectopic pregnancy.

4, On or about January 7, 2011, Respondent examined and evaluated Patient A
because he was the on-call obstetrician for St. Rose Siena Hospital. Respondent ordered Patient A
undergo a Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) blood test and an ultrasound to determine
whether Patient A was pregnant. Patient A’s HCG level was 7,803 mIU/ml. The ultrasound did
not show that Patient A had an intrauterine pregnancy, but it did show that Patient A had a two (2)
centimeter ovarian mass that the radiologist noted should be considered as a possible ectopic
pregnancy. Upon receipt of this information, Respondent performed a Dilation and Curettage on
Patient A. Respondent requested a pathology consult on the tissue from the Dilation and
Curettage specimen. The pathology showed no signs of products of conception. Thus, Patient A
was admitted to the hospital for overnight observation due to concerns of a possible ectopic
pregnancy.

5. On or about January 8, 2011, Patient A’s HCG level was 6,500 mIU/ml. Due to
the decreased HCG level, Respondent discharged Patient A.

6. On or about January 12, 2011, Patient A presented to Respondent for a follow-up
visit. Respondent did not perform a pelvic exam or an ultrasound despite his knowledge that the
Dilation and Curettage specimen showed no evidence of conception. Respondent did order
Patient A to undergo two HCG blood tests before her next scheduled appointment on
January 19, 2011.

7. Patient A underwent a HCG blood test on or about January 12, 2011 and January
17, 2011. The respective HCG levels were 18,675 mIU/ml and 22,670 mIU/ml.

8. On or about January 19, 2011, Patient A presented to Respondent for a follow-up
visit. During this visit, Respondent was aware of Patient A’s HCG levels from the January 12 and
January 17 blood tests. During this visit, Respondent did not perform a pelvic exam.
