FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman, Valerie J. Clark,
BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, by and through
Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., Board General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a reasonable
basis to believe that Michael Kaplan, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630, collectively the Medical Practice Act (MPA), hereby issues its First Amended
Complaint, stating the IC's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent was originally licensed to practice medicine on December 2, 1989 by
the Board pursuant to the MPA. Respondent is currently licensed to practice medicine in active
status (License #5983). Respondent’s license to practice medicine was previously suspended-
indefinite status from March 14, 2011 until April 11, 2011, and then Respondent was on active
status with temporary conditions from April 12, 2011 to August 11, 2011.

2. Between December 15, 2010 and March 11, 2011, a minimum of 115 procedures
requiring disposable needle guides involving Patients 1-115 were performed in Respondent’s

Henderson office, whose identities are not revealed to protect their privacy but whose identities

have been provided to Respondent. Based on the number of disposable, single use needle guides
shipped to Respondent’s office, there were not enough disposable needle guides for all procedures
that were performed during this time period.

3. After procedures using the disposable, single use needle guides, medical assistants
(MAs) would attempt to clean and disinfect the disposable, single use needle guides by running
them under water, attempt to scrape out any remaining tissue or blood without using a brush and
would then soak them in Cidex solution and allow them to dry.

4, Interviews conducted with staff indicated that they were instructed by Respondent
to reuse the disposable, single use needle guides after procedures and continued to do so into the
month of March 2011.

5. Respondent admitted to reusing the disposable, single use needle guides.

6. On March 14, 2011, Respondent was served with an Order from the
IC, pursuant to NRS 630.326, summarily suspending his license to practice medicine based on the
preliminary findings of the Board’s investigation.

7. On August 12, 2011, Respondent’s license to practice medicine was returned to
full, active status, as all conditions/restrictions on his license were removed based upon his full
cooperation with the IC.

Count I

8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

9. NAC 630.230(1)(h) provides that the failure to adequately supervise an MA who is
employed or supervised by the physician is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

10. Respondent failed to adequately supervise his MAs when, among other things, he
knowingly allowed the reprocessing of disposable, single-use needle guides used during the
performance of urologic procedures and reuse of said disposable, single-use needle guides during
the time period set forth above, in the treatment of Patients 1-115.

11. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

Count II

12. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

13. NRS 630.306(7) provides that the continual failure to exercise the skill or
diligence or use the methods ordinarily exercised under the same circumstances by physicians in
good standing, practicing in the same specialty or field is grounds for initiating disciplinary action
against a licensee.

14, Respondent continually failed to exercise the skill or diligence or use the methods
ordinarily exercised under the same circumstances by physicians in good standing, practicing in
the same specialty or field by, among other things, knowingly allowing the reprocessing of
disposable, single-use needle guides used during the performance of urologic procedures and
reusing of said disposable, single-use needle guides during the time period set forth above and in
his failure to adequately supervise MAs as set forth above.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the First Amended Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the First Amended Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an

Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine the sanctions it will impose if it finds Respondent
violated the MPA;
4, That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of facts,

conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
