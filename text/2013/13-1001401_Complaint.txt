COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), composed at the time of filing this Complaint of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, by and
through Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., General Counsel for the Board and Attorney for the IC, having
a reasonable basis to believe that Charles Fred Xeller, M.D. (Respondent), violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 (Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its formal
Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status with the condition of no surgery
dated November 30, 2007 (License No. 6855). Respondent has been licensed by the Board since
July 31, 1993, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice Act.

2. Respondent is currently licensed to practice medicine in Nevada, and was so
licensed at the time of the incident complained of in this matter in the state of Michigan, Indiana
and California.

3. On March 3, 2005, a Superseding Administrative Complaint was filed against
Respondent with the state of Michigan Department of Community Health Bureau of Health

Professions Board of Medicine Disciplinary Subcommittee (Michigan Board).

4, On May 12, 2005, Respondent submitted a renewal application for a medical
doctor license with the state of Indiana Medical Licensing Board (Indiana Board). Allegedly,
Respondent incorrectly answered a question in the negative when he should have answered in the
positive.

5. On March 19, 2008, the Michigan Board entered an Order of Dismissal dismissing
the previously filed 2005 Superseding Administrative Complaint.

6. On September 28, 2011, the Indiana Board filed a disciplinary Complaint against
Respondent based upon the Michigan action and Respondent’s incorrect answer on the 2005
Indiana Board renewal application. The Indiana Board’s allegations were based upon
Respondent’s failure to report the past discipline or charges pending in the state of Michigan in
2005.

7. On January 25, 2012, Respondent entered into a settlement agreement with the
Indiana Board concerning the pending disciplinary Complaint. As a result, Respondent was
issued a Letter of Reprimand by the Indiana Board on January 26, 2012.

8. On June 29, 2012, Respondent was issued a Public Letter of Reprimand by the
Medical Board of California (California Board) based upon the foregoing.

COUNT I

9. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

10. NRS 630.301(3) provides that any disciplinary action, including, without
limitation, the revocation, suspension, modification or limitation of a license to practice any type
of medicine, taken by another state is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

11. The actions of the Michigan Board, Indiana Board and California Board constitute
disciplinary actions taken by another state(s) against Respondent that are grounds for initiating
discipline against Respondent.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
