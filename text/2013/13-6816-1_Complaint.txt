COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), composed at the time of filing this Complaint of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, by and
through Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., General Counsel for the Board and Attorney for the IC, having
a reasonable basis to believe that Larry Yee, M.D. (Respondent), violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 (Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its formal
Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in suspended status (License No. 4655) and has
been suspended since August 31, 2012. He was first licensed by the Board on July 10, 1982,
pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice Act.

2. On September 29, 2011, Respondent voluntarily surrendered his
Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) registration privileges for prescribing controlled substances.
To date, Respondent has failed to request new DEA registration privileges. Despite that,
Respondent continued to prescribe controlled substances for almost a full year from
September 29, 2011 to August 24, 2012.

3. On December 15, 2011, Respondent entered into a settlement agreement with the

Board. The settlement agreement was approved and became a Board order on March 9, 2012. As

a result of the Board settlement agreement and order, Respondent’s license was revoked with the
revocation stayed during Respondent’s indefinite probation and compliance with the stated
conditions.

4, Under the settlement agreement and order, Respondent and the Board agreed to
numerous conditions upon Respondent’s probation. One of the conditions of Respondent’s
probation required him to undergo outpatient psychiatric treatment/counseling at least two (2)
times per month. Relatedly, the psychiatrist/counselor was to provide the Board with monthly
status reports on Respondent.

5. On August 28, 2012, the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy (Board of Pharmacy)
issued a cease and desist dispensing notice concerning Respondent to all pharmacies in the state of
Nevada. This was based upon the Board of Pharmacy finally receiving notice from the DEA of
Respondent’s prior, voluntary surrender of his DEA registration on September 29, 2011.

6. As a result, the Board subsequently determined that Respondent had been
prescribing controlled substances without the required current DEA registration privileges. Based
upon these findings, the IC immediately summarily suspended Respondent’s license to practice
medicine on August 31, 2012 (as indicated above).

7, Additionally, on or about September 6, 2012, Respondent last saw his psychiatrist,
Nabil Jouni, M.D. (Dr. Jouni). Based upon Dr. Jouni’s last monthly status report, the IC believes
that Respondent has not seen Dr. Jouni since that time.

COUNT I

8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

9. NRS 630.306(3) provides that administering, dispensing or prescribing any
controlled substance to others except as authorized by law is grounds for initiating disciplinary
action against a licensee.

10. NRS 453.226(1) requires that every practitioner or other person who dispenses any
controlled substance within this State shall biennially obtain a controlled substance registration

issued by the Board of Pharmacy in accordance with its regulations.

11. NRS 453.231(1)(g) and 453.236(1)(c) both provide for the denial or
suspension/revocation of a practitioner’s Board of Pharmacy registration for losing authorization
under federal law to manufacture, distribute, possess, administer or dispense controlled
substances. Furthermore, 21 C.F.R. 1306.03 requires a state registration in order to manufacture,
distribute, possess, administer or dispense controlled substances.

12. | Respondent’s surrender of his federal DEA registration on September 29, 2011 and
his continued prescribing of controlled substances after that time without a current DEA
registration demonstrates his unlawful prescribing of controlled substances for almost a year
without proper registration with the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT U

14. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

15. NRS 630.3065(2)(a) provides that the willful failure of a licensee to comply with
an order of the Board is grounds for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

16. | Respondent’s failure to see his psychiatrist/counselor two (2) times per month as
required by the Board settlement agreement and order constitutes the willful failure to comply
with an order of the Board.

17. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT UI

18. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

19. NRS 630.301(9) provides that engaging in conduct that brings the medical
profession into disrepute is grounds for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

20. Respondent’s actions in unlawfully writing prescriptions in the state of Nevada for

almost a year, losing his Board of Pharmacy registration and willfully failing to comply with the

terms and conditions of the Board settlement agreement and order is conduct that brings the
medical profession into disrepute.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC requests:

1, That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an
Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine the sanctions it will impose if it finds Respondent
violated the Medical Practice Act;

4, That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent, in writing, its findings of
fact, conclusions of law and order, which shall include the sanctions imposed; and

5. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these

premises.
