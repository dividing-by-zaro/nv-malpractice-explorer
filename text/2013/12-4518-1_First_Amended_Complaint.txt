THEODORE M. THORP, M.D.,

Respondent.


FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), composed at the time of filing of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, by and
through Erin L. Albright, Esq., Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Theodore M. Thorp, M.D. (Respondent), violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 (Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its formal
First Amended Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The following facts are pertinent to a determination on this matter.
A. Respondent’s Licensure Status in Nevada

1, Respondent has been licensed by the Board since July 1, 1975, pursuant to the
provisions of the Medical Practice Act.

2. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 2979).
B. Respondent’s Supervision of Christa Swiatek, Medical Assistant

3. At all times alleged herein, Respondent was the supervising physician for Christa

Swiatek (Swiatek), Medical Assistant (MA).

4, Upon information and belief, the following was the customary practice in
Respondent’s office in 2010: the MA conducted the initial patient in-take. Respondent or a
Physician Assistant-Certified (PA-C) evaluated the patient and assessed the patient’s complaints.
Respondent or a PA-C outlined the patient’s diagnosis and treatment plan in the patient’s chart.
The MA reviewed the diagnosis and treatment plan for each patient. The PA-C filled out and
signed all prescription forms for his patients.

Respondent did not fill out the patient’s prescription form. Instead, he provided the MA
with a pre-signed prescription form for each prescribed medication. The MA completed the
prescription form by filing in the type of medication, the quantity of medication, the patient’s
name and the patient’s date of birth. The MA was advised by Respondent that each prescribed
medication needed its own prescription form. However, Respondent failed to make sure the MAs
followed his instructions and wrote each prescribed medication on its own prescription form.

5. On or about October 6, 2010, Respondent’s practice manager, Laura Carbajal,
conducted an audit of patient prescriptions after a local pharmacy suspected prescription fraud.
The audit revealed multiple prescriptions that were filled under Respondent’s license for
individuals who were not his patients.

6. Respondent suspected Swiatek of fraud and advised her of the evidence. Swiatek
provided no response and immediately resigned.

C. Respondent’s Supervision of Alfredo Hibbert, PA-C

7. At all times alleged herein, Respondent was the supervising physician for Alfredo
Hibbert (Hibbert), PA-C.

8. To protect the privacy of the patients referenced herein, their true identities are not
disclosed; however, their identities are disclosed in the Patient Designation served on Respondent
contemporaneously with a copy of this Complaint.

9. In or around June 2010, Nicholas Karel (Karel) solicited Hibbert to participate in a
scheme in which Karel would provide Hibbert with a list of names and copies of identification.
Hibbert would write controlled substance prescriptions for the names on the list and Karel would

pay Respondent One Hundred Fifty and 00/100 Dollars ($150.00) per controlled substance
prescription.

10. In or around June 2010, Hibbert leased office space from Respondent for the
purpose of performing cosmetic revisions to rough skin. Hibbert operated his practice on the
weekends.

11. Respondent supervised Hibbert’s practice as follows: Respondent and Hibbert
conducted telephonic conferences once or twice a month to discuss Hibbert’s patients.
Respondent never personally reviewed any charts for Hibbert’s patients. In addition, Respondent
never visited Hibbert’s office on the weekends while Hibbert was meeting with patients.

12. From approximately June 2010 through July 2011, Hibbert fraudulently created,
either in whole or in part, medical records and patient charts for at least thirteen (13) individuals
identified as Patients A — M on the Patient Designation for the purpose of prescribing controlled
substances.

13. From approximately June 2010 through July 2011, Hibbert fraudulently wrote
approximately 2000 controlled substance prescriptions in exchange for One Hundred Fifty and
00/00 Dollars ($150.00) per prescription. These prescriptions were not authorized by the
Respondent.
