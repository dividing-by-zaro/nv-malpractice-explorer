3, On or about November 30, 2010, Patient A underwent a total vaginal hysterectomy,
which was performed by Respondent.

4, On or about December 20, 2010, Patient A presented to Respondent for a
postoperative examination with complaints of increased pain after the hysterectomy and a foul
smelling discharge from her vagina. Respondent performed a physical examination on Patient A
and noted the presence of feces in her vaginal cuff and an opening extending from Patient A’s
rectum into her vagina. Respondent scheduled Patient A for a diagnostic laparoscopy and
examination under anesthesia.

5. On or about December 23, 2010, Patient A presented to the Las Vegas Surgery
Center for the diagnostic laparoscopy and examination under anesthesia, which was performed by
Respondent. Respondent examined Patient A and noted the vaginal area contained a recto-vaginal
fistula. Respondent attempted to close the recto-vaginal fistula with chromic and Monocryl
sutures in a layered fashion as a temporary measure until consultation could be made with another
physician.

6. On or about December 28, 2010, Patient A telephoned Respondent with complaints
of pelvic pain and a foul smelling discharge. Patient A was scheduled for repair of the recto-
vaginal fistula with another physician. Upon examination, the other physician decided to perform
an ileostomy due to the inflamed vaginal tissue, thus allowing the tissue to heal before repairing
the recto-vaginal fistula.

7. Further, Respondent’s medical records for Patient A are inaccurate, incomplete,
illegible and/or untimely.
