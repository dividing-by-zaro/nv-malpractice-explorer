ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION

Prior to the preparation of this Order of Summary Suspension, Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners (Board) staff presented evidence and information to an Investigative
Committee (IC) of the Board, composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, regarding
John Andrews Tafel, M.D. (Dr. Tafel). Upon review of the evidence and information presented by
Board staff, the IC hereby IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDS Dr. Tafel’s license to practice medicine
in the state of Nevada pursuant to Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) 630.326(1), based upon the
following preliminary findings:

1. Dr. Tafel is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
(License No. 14116) and was originally licensed on September 21, 2011. Dr. Tafel lists his
specialty with the Board as physical medicine/rehab. Dr. Tafel is also licensed to practice
medicine in the state of Texas.

2. It is believed that Dr. Tafel is the owner, operator, director of four (4) pain
management clinics in the state of Texas and/or the supervisor of advanced practice nurses and/or
physician assistants in those clinics.

3. It is further believed that on or about October 22, 2012, Texas Medical Board staff,

in conjunction with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), conducted a raid of Dr. Tafel’s four (4)

pain clinics in Texas. The raid uncovered evidence that Dr. Tafel was improperly and illegally
operating the pain management clinics, including the method and manner of prescribing of
controlled substances.

4. As a result, Dr. Tafel surrendered his DEA and Texas Department of Public Safety
authority to write prescriptions for controlled substances on or about that same day,
October 22, 2012.

5. Subsequently, on December 6, 2012, Dr. Tafel’s license to practice medicine in the
state of Texas was temporarily suspended by the Texas Medical Board. The temporary suspension
was based upon evidence of, and related allegations of, the illegal operation of the aforementioned
four (4) pain management clinics in Texas.

As a result of the foregoing, the IC reasonably determines and believes that due to the
recent suspension of Dr. Tafel’s license in Texas, the health, safety and welfare of the public is at
imminent risk of harm and that a summary suspension of Dr. Tafel’s license to practice is
necessary to remove said risk of imminent harm to the health, safety and welfare of the public.

Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
of John Andrews Tafel, M.D. (License No. 14116) is HEREBY SUSPENDED until further order
of the Investigative Committee or Board; and

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing be set within forty-five (45) days of this
Order, pursuant to NRS 630.326(2), to determine whether this suspension may continue, unless
the parties mutually agree to a different or divergent time frame.
