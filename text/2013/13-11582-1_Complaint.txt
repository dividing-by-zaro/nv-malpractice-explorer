COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),

composed of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., and Ms. Donna A. Ruthe, at
the time the complaint was authorized for filing, by and through Edward O. Cousineau, Esq., Deputy
Executive Director for the Board and counsel for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that
John A. Anson, M.D., hereinafter referred to as "Respondent," has violated the provisions of Nevada
Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the IC's charges and
allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is licensed in active status to practice medicine in the state of Nevada,
and at all times alleged herein, was so licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of
Chapter 630 of the NRS.

2. Patient A was a sixty-year-old female at the time of the events at issue. Her true
identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation
served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A, who had a history of previous back surgeries, was admitted and
underwent a surgical procedure at Southern Hills Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada, on

November 5, 2009. The procedure was performed by Respondent and resulted in the removal of

previously surgically implanted instrumentation at the C5-C6 levels. Thereafter, Respondent
performed an anterior cervical discectomy with fusion and placed new instrumentation in Patient
A, at the C5-C7 levels.

4. On November 7, 2009, while still hospitalized, Patient A underwent a CT scan of
the thorax, which revealed midline lower cervical and upper gas lucencies and edema,
subcutaneous fat stranding and gas along the interior chest wall, and edema along the anterior
fusion plate. Patient A was diagnosed with pneumonia.

5. On November 10, 2009, again still hospitalized, Patient A experienced a coughing
fit, which was followed by increased neck swelling and dysphagia. A second CT scan was
performed in response, which revealed a large amount of gas within the neck anterior to the
original surgical site. The reviewing radiologist report stated that, “[b]ased on the large amount of
gas present, considerations would include the possibility of injury to the airway or esophagus.”

6. On November 11, 2009, Patient A was suffering leukocytosis. Despite this
circumstance and evidence of postoperative complications, i.e., a high fever, concerning CT scan
findings, and ongoing wound drainage, Patient A was discharged on November 12, 2009 with oral
antibiotics and a diagnosis of pneumonia.

7. On November 16, 2009, Patient A was readmitted to the hospital, diagnosed with
an esophageal fistula, and ultimately underwent an extended corrective surgical and recovery
course.

8. It is now alleged by the IC that Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill
or knowledge, ordinarily used in similar circumstances in his treatment of Patient A when he
failed to surgically explore whether there had been an injury to Patient A due to her leukocytosis,
fever symptoms, wound drainage, and disconcerting CT scan findings.

9. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice, defined as the failure to use the
reasonable care, ‘skill or knowledge ordinarily used in similar circumstances, is grounds for
initiating disciplinary action.

10. Based upon the foregoing, Respondent committed malpractice in the course of
providing care and treatment to Patient A and is subject to discipline by the Board as provided in
NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners fix a time and place for a formal
hearing;

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him, the time and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions against
him;

3, That the Board determine what sanctions it deems appropriate to impose for the
violation committed by Respondent; and

4, That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact, conclusions
of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions to be imposed.
