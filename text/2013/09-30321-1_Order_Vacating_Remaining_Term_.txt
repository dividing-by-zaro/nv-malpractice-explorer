ORDER VACATING REMAINING TERM OF PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED
SETTLEMENT, WAIVER AND CONSENT AGREEMENT

On August 11, 2009, a Settlement, Waiver and Consent Agreement (Agreement) between

the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) and Adrian Adrian, M.D. (Respondent)
was filed with the Board. The Agreement contained various terms and conditions, all of which
have been accomplished or satisfied by Respondent, with the exception that “Respondent will not
perform any cosmetic medical procedures for a period of five years after the adoption of this
Agreement.”

The Board received a request from Respondent, via his counsel, Kelly S. McIntosh, Esq.,
that the remaining term to the Agreement be vacated, as the term is impacting Respondent’s
ability to obtain and maintain certification by the American Board of Family Medicine, thus
impacting Respondent’s employment opportunities.

The aforementioned request came before the Board for consideration at its regularly
scheduled meeting on March 8, 2013, at the Board’s offices located at 1105 Terminal Way, Suite
301, Reno, Nevada, 89502, and by video conference at the offices of the Nevada State Board of
Dental Examiners located at 6010 S. Rainbow Boulevard, Building A, Suite 1,
Las Vegas, Nevada 89118. Respondent was not present, but was represented by his counsel in
Las Vegas.
