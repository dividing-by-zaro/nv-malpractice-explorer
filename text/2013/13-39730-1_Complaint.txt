COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),

composed at the time of filing this Complaint of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Chairman, Beverly
A. Neyland, M.D., Member, and Donna A. Ruthe, Member, by and through Bradley O. Van Ry,
Esq., General Counsel for the Board and attorney for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe
that John Bernard Abbago, CRT (Respondent), violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating
the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1, Respondent is currently licensed (License No. RC2145) to practice respiratory
care, and was initially licensed by the Board on June 8, 2012, pursuant to the provisions of the
Medical Practice Act.

2. Respondent submitted his application for CRT licensure on January 1, 2012. On
that initial licensure application, Respondent answered “yes” to question thirteen (13) involving
criminal offenses.

3. Subsequently, and on multiple occasions, Respondent provided explanations to the
Baord for his “yes” answer on question thirteen (13) to the Board. Therein, Respondent made
explicit false statement(s).

4, Previously, on June 26, 2007, Respondent pled guilty to Conspiracy to Commit
Battery with use of a Deadly Weapon. Respondent was then placed on probation from which he
was dishonorably discharged on May 28, 2009.

5. Respondent’s false statement(s) to the Board involve claims of not being personally
involved with physically assaulting the alleged victim of the criminal activity and pertain to a
partial payment of the fine arising from probation.

6. On June 8, 2012, Respondent appeared before the Board to discuss question
thirteen (13) and his varied explanations to the question as well as his request for CRT licensure.
During that appearance, Respondent made other demonstrably false statements.

7. Respondent stated that he “didn’t actually throw a punch or strike’em. . . strike the
person. I held him back, and I held back the person who tried to get involved also.”

8. Respondent also stated that he “only paid a hundred dollars of this because I was
going through financial problems.”

9. After the meeting with the Board, Respondent was granted an unrestricted license
to practice respiratory care in the state of Nevada.

10. Significantly, a video of the entire incident involving Respondent and others in the
alleged criminal behavior is available for review. A review of the video establishes that
Respondent made false statements on his explanations to the Board in writing and in person.

11. | Respondent also made false statements pertaining to repayment of the fine arising
from his related probation.
