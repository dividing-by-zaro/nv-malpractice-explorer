3. On or about December 8, 2009, Patient A presented to Respondent to establish as a
patient for Vaser Liposuction.

4, On or about December 17, 2009, Patient A presented to Respondent for Vaser
Liposuction of the chin and jaw line. This procedure was uneventful.

5. On or about December 23, 2009, Patient A presented to Respondent for Vaser
Liposuction of the upper and lower abdomen.

6. During the second liposuction procedure, Patient A became unstable and
emergency medical services (EMS) were called. EMS arrived and transported Patient A to the
hospital, where he was admitted for an altered mental status, anoxic encephalopathy and
leukocytosis.

7. While being admitted to the hospital, Patient A complained of increasing
abdominal pain. He was found to be tachypneic and tachycardic. A CT scan of Patient A’s
abdomen and pelvis showed free air that was suspicious for perforated viscus.

8. On or about December 24, 2009, Patient A underwent an exploratory laparotomy
and was found to have adhesions from his Vaser Liposuction procedure along with enteric
contents in the peritoneal cavity. Patient A was noted to have several perforations in the small
bowel at approximately the junction of the proximal two-thirds and distal one-third of the small
bowel that was contained within a fifteen (15) - centimeter segment. A small bowel resection and
primary anastomosis was performed.

9. During Patient A’s hospital stay he was also diagnosed with a pulmonary embolus.

10. Patient A’s medical records do not contain a preoperative physical exam and/or
preoperative abdominal physical exam performed by Respondent. The records only contain a
brief history, which was performed by a registered nurse/medical assistant. The brief history was

never signed by Respondent.
