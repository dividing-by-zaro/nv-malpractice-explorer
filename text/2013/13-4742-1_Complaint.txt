return to his office within one week for a follow-up appointment..

St. Mary’s Hospital complaining of abdominal pain, chills, fever and increased abdominal girth.

had metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis and hyponatremia.

9. Approximately eight (8) hours after his admission to the hospital, Patient A

illegible and/or untimely.
