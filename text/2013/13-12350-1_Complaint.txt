3, On or about April 11, 2008, Patient A was hospitalized and treated for both
congestive heart failure and hypertension. Patient A remained hospitalized until April 14, 2008.
During Patient A’s hospital stay, diagnostic tests were performed, which evidenced the patient’s
renal function was impaired.

4, On or about April 14, 2008, Patient A was discharged from the hospital and
ordered to take five (5) milligrams (mg) of Enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor,
twice a day.

5. On or about April 17, 2008, Patient A presented to Respondent to establish care as
her primary care physician and to follow-up on the patient’s prior hospitalization. Respondent
diagnosed Patient A with uncontrolled hypertension and increased her Enalapril prescription from
five (5) mg to ten (10) mg. Patient A’s medical records do not contain documentation
demonstrating that Respondent obtained and reviewed the patient’s medical records from her April
11, 2008 through April 14, 2008 hospitalization or that Respondent communicated with the
patient’s cardiologist. Further, Patient A’s medical records from this visit are inaccurate,
incomplete, illegible and/or untimely.

6. On or about May 1, 2008, Patient A presented to Respondent for a follow-up visit
complaining of a dry, persistent cough for four (4) days. Patient A’s medical records from this
visit contain documentation noting that the patient was recently seen by her cardiologist and that
the cardiologist ordered lab work, which was performed on April 21, 2008. However, Patient A’s
medical records lack documentation demonstrating that the Respondent obtained and/or reviewed
the patient’s April 21, 2008 lab work or that Respondent communicated with the patient’s
cardiologist. During this visit, Respondent did not order Patient A to obtain lab work.
Respondent diagnosed Patient A with uncontrolled hypertension and renal insufficiency but failed
to outline a plan for addressing the patient’s renal insufficiency. Respondent increased Patient A’s
Enalapril prescription from ten (10) mg to twenty (20) mg. Further, Patient A’s medical records
from this visit are inaccurate, incomplete, illegible and/or untimely.

7. On or about May 12, 2008, Patient A presented to Respondent for a follow-up visit.

Patient A’s medical records from this visit do not contain documentation diagnosing the patient

with renal insufficiency. Respondent did not order Patient A to obtain lab work. However,
Patient A’s cardiologist did order the patient to obtain lab work. Further, Patient A’s medical
records from this visit are inaccurate, incomplete, illegible and/or untimely.

8. On or about May 13, 2008, Patient A was advised to see Respondent based on the
results of her lab work, which showed both her potassium and creatinine levels were elevated.
Patient A was immediately admitted to the hospital from Respondent’s office with acute renal
failure and hyperkalemia secondary to wrongfully increasing the dose of Enalapril. Further, Patient
A’s medical records from this visit are inaccurate, incomplete, illegible and/or untimely.
