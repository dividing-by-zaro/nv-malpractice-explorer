The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing was approved of Charles N. Held, M.D., Theodore Berndt, M.D., and

and allegations, as follows:

1, Dr. Sacco is currently licensed in active status (License No. 13323), and was so
licensed on November 4, 2009 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. Between August 5, 2005 and
November 4, 2009, Dr. Sacco held a Special Purpose License in the state of Nevada.

2. On December 9, 2010, the Colorado Medical Board issued Dr. Sacco a letter of
admonition based upon his care of a patient in 2005 when he failed to recommend additional
imaging studies for the patient based upon findings of digital radiographs which caused a two
week delay in diagnosis and treatment.

3. Based on the issuance of the letter of admonition by the Colorado Medical Board,
the Texas Medical Board issued a Corrective Order to Dr. Sacco on February 4, 2011 and the

Medical Board of California issued a letter of public reprimand on March 24, 2011.
