Thomas Edward Rembetski, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the
provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative
Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 5964), and has been

so licensed since December 2, 1989 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to

the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

January 28, 2008. Respondent performed the surgery at St. Mary's Regional Medical Center.

this, Respondent discharged Patient A with instructions to return to his office during the next week
and to also see a pain management physician that afternoon.

5. Despite this course of treatment, Patient A again presented to Respondent with
continued severe pain. Respondent prescribed Valium and Demerol and scheduled Patient A to
return in ten (10) days.

6. Significantly, the pain management physician subsequently referred Patient A to a
gastroenterologist. This was for further follow-up on Patient A's continued pain.

7. On February 18, 2008, Patient A underwent a HIDA scan as ordered by the
gastroenterologist. The results suggested the presence of a bile leak.

8. As a result, Patient A underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy and placement of a
stent. Patient A was then discharged to return to the surgeon in two (2) weeks.

9. On March 5, 2008, Patient A was brought by ambulance to St. Mary's Regional
Medical Center. He was diagnosed with a hepatic abscess and multiple liver abscesses.

10. Patient A died two (2) days later of acute hepatic abscess with septic shock on
March 7, 2008.

scan in a timely fashion to identify the bile leak; failed to repeat a CT scan to identify the bile leak;
