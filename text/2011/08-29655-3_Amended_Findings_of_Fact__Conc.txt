Complaint filed herein. Respondent Paul Cutarelli, M.D., hereinafter “Respondent,” was

the Board.

The Board, having previously received and read the Second Amended Complaint
and exhibits admitted in the matter, as well as the Synopsis of Record prepared by the
hearing officer who presided over the hearing and the transcript of the hearing, and
hearing arguments from Mr. Mortensen and Ms. Beggs, proceeded to make a decision

pursuant to the provisions of NRS chapters 233B and 630.




The Board, after due consideration of the record, evidence, arguments, law, and
Petition for Judicial Review filed by Respondent, and being fully advised in the premises,
amends its FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ORDER in this matter
as follows:

FINDINGS OF FACT
I.

Respondent held a license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada at all
relevant times.

Il.

On October 30, 2008, the Investigative Committee filed the Complaint in this
matter alleging violations of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. A First
Amended Complaint was subsequently filed on December 19, 2008. A Second
Amended Complaint was filed on January 27, 2010.

lll.

On January 27, 2010 and January 28, 2010, a hearing was held before an
appointed hearing officer on the allegations contained within the Second Amended
Complaint. Respondent was represented by counsel; Hal Taylor, Esq. and C. Gregory
Tiemeier, Esq. The Investigative Committee was represented by Lyn E. Beggs, Esq. At
the time of hearing, count II was dismissed.

IV.

The matter was presented to the above-listed Board members for consideration
at the regularly scheduled Board meeting on June 11, 2010, and after discussion and
deliberation the Board entered its previously filed Findings of Facts, Conclusions of Law
and Order.

V.

On July 22, 2010, through new counsel of record, David J. Mortensen, Esq.,

Respondent caused to be filed in the First Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada





in and for Carson City, a timely Petition for Judicial Review contesting and appealing the
Board’s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order.
Vi.

The Board has reconsidered its previously entered findings and in consideration
and review of all information before it on March 11, 2011, the Board deems it
appropriate to enter an Amended Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order and
withdraw the previously issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order.

Vil.

Patient N came to Valley Eye Center on June 18, 2008 for Lasik surgery to be
performed by Respondent. Prior to surgery, Respondent performed a slit-lamp
examination on Patient N through the Nidek microscope. All findings of the examination
on Patient N were within normal limits, but the slit-lamp examination was not noted in
Patient N’s medical records.

VIII.

The Board finds by a preponderance of the evidence that although Respondent
did not commit medical malpractice, Respondent violated NRS 630.3062(1) in that he
failed to maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete medical records relating to the
diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient N when he failed to note in the medical records
that he performed a normal slit-lamp examination of Patient N through the Nidek
microscope.

IX.

The Board rescinds its previous finding that Respondent violated NRS 630.301(4)
as alleged in Count I, and NRS 630.306(7) as alleged in Count Ill, of the Second
Amended Complaint, as the evidence does not support such a finding.

X.

If any of the foregoing Findings of Fact is more properly deemed a Conclusion of

Law, it may be so construed.

If
