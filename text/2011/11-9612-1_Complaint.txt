The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, comprised
of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and Valerie J. Clark,
Member, at the time it approved and authorized the filing of this complaint having a reasonable

the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative
Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent's license is currently in active status (License No. 5916), and has been
so licensed since September 16, 1989 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant
to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was an eighteen year old (18) female at the time of the incidents in

Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

with a headache and lower abdominal pain. She was 30.3 weeks pregnant and obese.

5. Patient A remained in the hospital for almost three (3) hours. During that time,
Patient A exhibited five (5) questionable blood pressure measurements. The nurse found that
Patient A had a closed cervix and normal fetal heart rate without contractions.

6. Respondent was informed of these vitals and the physical assessment by the
nursing staff. Patient A was then discharged without ever seeing, or being examined by,
Respondent.

7. About thirty (30) hours later, Patient A presented to the hospital again with the
same complaints of headaches, abdominal pain. She also complained of decreased fetal
movement. Patient A was ultimately diagnosed with Preeclampsia, and the infant was born and

pronounced dead the next day.

8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

9, Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of

a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

10. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

11. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under the same or similar circumstances when she failed and omitted to personally and fully
evaluate Patient A; failed to admit Patient A to the hospital; failed to ensure that Patient A was
further evaluated; and, failed to obtain an ultrasound of the fetus to assess whether the early onset
hypertension had restricted its growth.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:
