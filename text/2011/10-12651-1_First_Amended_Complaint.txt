FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and
Valerie J. Clark, Member, having a reasonable basis to believe that Steve Wong, M.D., hereinafter
referred to as Respondent, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its
formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 9020), and has been
so licensed since July 1, 1999 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AS TO COUNTS LAND II

2. Patient A was a twenty-three year old (23) male at the time of the incidents in
question. His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along witha copy of this Complaint. .

3. Patient A suffered from pain and swelling of his jaw along with difficulty
swallowing. He was admitted to the hospital on May 27, 2008. He was found to have
submandibular/sublingual cellulitis. As a result, the oral surgeon decided to extract the lower right
and lower left wisdom teeth. Respondent was to be the anesthesiologist for the surgery.

4, A CT scan of the neck on May 27, 2008 showed severe wisdom tooth infection
with impending Ludwig's angina and swelling present in multiple areas of the oropharynx and
neck. Another CT scan of the neck on May 30, 2008 clearly showed diffuse progression of
sublingual abscess, new progression into the submandibular space, fluid collections consistent
with abscesses in the left supraclavicular and retropharyngeal areas from C2 to C5, and
anterior neck inferiorly along strap muscles to the level of the anterosuperior mediastinum, and
true Ludwig's Angina.

5. This clinical scenario along with the physical exam were clear red flags that airway
protection could easily be jeopardized during the planned surgery. Loss of a controlled airway
would lead to hypoxia and hypercarbia. Respondent also missed the significance of the second
CT scan and thought that it showed essentially the same things as the initial CT scan.

6. At the time of surgery, Respondent utilized an LMA airway device instead of an
Endotracheal tube. The use of an LMA does not provide optimal airway protection as it does not
enter the trachea and has no cuff to ensure adequate seal. The LMA use as an airway device was
strongly contraindicated because of the presence of Patient A's multiple oropharyngeal abscesses
with Ludwig's angina, Patient A's morbid obesity and the identification of preoperative trismus.

7. The surgery was performed on May 31, 2008. As the LMA was removed by
Respondent at the end of the surgery, Patient A began moving around a lot requiring four people
to restrain him. The pulse Oxygen was not picking up signal and was without a good wave form
on the pletysmograph.

8. Bradycardia began concurrently with removal of the LMA, and asystole quickly
followed. Patient A coded and was without an open airway for eleven (11) minutes into the code
process. Respondent finally placed an Endotracheal tube on Patient A eleven (11) minutes into the
code process. By the time Patient A arrived at the ICU, his neurological status was documented
and consistent with severe anoxic injury.

9. The prolonged and severe anoxic event at the close of surgery on May 31, 2008 led
to severe brain injury. Patient A suffered brain death on June 10, 2008.

10. Additionally, the record keeping of events immediately following surgery and
during the anoxic event was poor. The vital signs monitoring machine records were not produced
or made available. Respondent, moreover, admits that the LMA was removed for six to eight
(6-8) minutes in his letter to the Board. There is no mention of this in the OR notes.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS AS TO COUNTS III, IV AND V

11. On or about September 15, 1992, Respondent was arrested for a misdemeanor in
Bakersfield, Kern County, California. The case was ultimately dismissed.

12. On or about October 19, 2002, Respondent was arrested for a felony in
Bakersfield, Kern County, California. After a no contest plea, the case was ultimately dismissed.

13. Respondent failed to disclose one or both of the arrests as required by Nevada law
on six (6) separate license renewal forms. He failed to do so in 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007 and
2009.

14. On his license renewal form dated 5-18-09, Respondent answered no to
Question six (6) concerning criminal investigations, arrests and charges.

15. On his license renewal form dated 4-20-07, Respondent answered no to the
question concerning criminal investigations, arrests and charges.
