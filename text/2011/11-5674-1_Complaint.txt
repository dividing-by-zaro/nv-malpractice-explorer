COMPLAINT

at the time filing was approved of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Mr. Van Heffner and
Beverly Neyland, M.D., having a reasonable basis to believe that William Mishler, M.D.,
hereinafter referred to as Dr. Mishler, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby
issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as
follows:

1. Dr. Mishler is currently licensed in active status (License No. 3920), and was
originally licensed on January 1, 1980 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant
to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a sixty year-old female at the time she presented to Dr. Mishler. Her
true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Dr. Mishler along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A presented to Dr. Mishler in early February 2006 with complaints of right
long finger pain and popping. She was placed in occupational therapy for three weeks and was to
be seen again by Dr. Mishler. Long fingers are also known as middle fingers.

4, Patient A returned to Dr. Mishler on February 24, 2006 after doing occupational

therapy which had helped, but Patient A was still experiencing some grabbing. Dr. Mishler

recommended surgical release and discussed the risks and benefits of surgery with Patient A
versus non-surgical options. The medical record clearly indicates the right long trigger finger was
discussed.

5. On March 9, 2006, Patient A presented to Quail Surgery Center for a right long
finger trigger release. The informed consent document signed by Patient A identifies the operation
to be conducted to be a right long trigger finger release and documents from the surgery center
indicate that the right long finger was marked for surgery. The operative note completed by
Dr. Mishler indicates that the pre-, post- and final diagnosis was right long finger trigger finger.

6. Patient A returned to Dr. Mishler on March 15, 2006 for follow up. The record for
Patient A created that day indicated that the patient is “status post right long finger trigger finger
release” and also indicated that the “patient’s right long trigger finger is healing quite well.”
However, handwritten above this statement is “R Ring Finger.” Patient was referred to
occupational therapy.

7. Patient A again returned to Dr. Mishler on March 29, 2006 for further follow up.
The medical record created on this date indicates that Patient A is “status post right ring finger
trigger release on March 9, 2006.” It was noted that Patient A was to complete occupational
therapy for her right ring finger and if necessary the long finger.

8. Notes from occupational therapy indicate that on March 28, 2006, Patient A noted
that her middle finger (long finger) continued to catch and that the incision appeared to be on her
ring finger. Further occupational therapy notes indicate that Patient A continued to complain of
middle finger triggering and pain.

9. All documentation indicates that Patient A’s right middle finger was not surgically
released as anticipated but rather that a wrong site surgery occurred and Patient A’s right ring
finger was operated on.

Count I

10. | Nevada Administrative Code section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a

physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under

similar circumstances.

11. Nevada Revised Statutes section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating discipline against a licensee.

12. Dr. Mishler committed malpractice when he performed surgery on Patient A’s right
ring finger rather than her right long (middle) finger when her issues were in regard to her right
middle finger and she consented to a right long finger trigger release.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Dr. Mishler is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Dr. Mishler notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service
of the Complaint.

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a
formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
determines to impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical
Practice Act (Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 630) committed by Dr. Mishler; and

4. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Dr. Mishler its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the
sanctions imposed; and

5. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners take such other and further
action as may be just and proper in these premises.
