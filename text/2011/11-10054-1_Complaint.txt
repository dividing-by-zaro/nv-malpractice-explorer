to review the medical records of Patients A, B, and C.

medical records to support her prescribing practices. Furthermore, that the prescribing of the
narcotics was accomplished absent a physical examination of Patient A by Respondent.

narcotics by Respondent. During this timeframe, Patient B resided in the Reno area. The

her prescribing practices. Furthermore, that the prescribing of the narcotics was accomplished
absent a physical examination of Patient B by Respondent.
