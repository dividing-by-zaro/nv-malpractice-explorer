treatment and care of a patient is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

when he failed to document the incident involving Patient A coming off of the operating table in the
anesthesia record and accordingly is in violation of NRS 630.3062(1).

Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:
