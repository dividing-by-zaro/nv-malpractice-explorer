NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
MERICAL EXAMINERS
By: A vem

In The Matter of Charges and

Complaint Against
GRAHAM DUNDAS SIMPSON, M.D.,

Respondent.


COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed at
the time filing of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Graham Dundas Simpson, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the provisions
of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent's license is currently in active status (License No. 3723), and has been so
licensed since January 1, 1979 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a fifty-nine year old (59) male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On August 21, 2008, Patient A presented to Cenegenics Medical Institute and the
Respondent primarily for weight loss. During the initial work-up, Patient A admitted to being
addicted to pain medications. He admitted to taking Oxycontin, 80 mg 3 tablets 3X per day, and
Percocet, 30 mg 8-12 tablets per day. He also told Respondent that he was taking methimazole for a

thyroid condition.

4. Despite Patient A taking methimazole, Respondent prescribed Armour thyroid. This
was to treat a claimed hypothyroid condition.

5. Respondent also prescribed testosterone cypionate IM 0.4 cc 2X weekly to treat the
low testosterone levels. This was a failure by Respondent to recognize that the low testosterone
levels of Patient A were due to his chronic dependence on opioids, his obesity and diabetes. Again,
despite this, Respondent increased the dosage of testosterone cypionate IM to 0.6 cc 2X weekly.
Two weeks later, the dosage was lowered to the initial amount of 0.4 cc 2X weekly.

6. Respondent also initially prescribed supplementation with DHEA for Patient A. This
too was unwarranted and unnecessary because Patient A's low DHEA was due to his chronic opioid
dependence.

7. Patient A terminated his medical care with Cenegenics Medical Institute and the

Respondent on or about February 11, 2009.

Count I
8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.
9. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a

physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under
similar circumstances.

10. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds for
initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

11. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under the same or similar circumstances by, among other things, when he failed and omitted to
recognize that Patient A was already on a course of treatment, methimazole, for hyperthyroidism and
then prescribed Armour thyroid to treat hypothyroidism; failed and omitted to recognize that Patient
A's low testosterone level(s) were the result of chronic opioid dependence, obesity and diabetes and
then prescribed testosterone cypionate to treat the low levels; failed and omitted to recognize that
Patient A's low DHEA was also secondary to opioid dependence and then prescribed supplemental

DHEA for Patient A.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service of
the Complaint.

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a formal
hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
determines to impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical Practice
Act (Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 630) committed by Respondent; and

4. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Respondent its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions
imposed; and

5. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners take such other and further action
as may be just and proper in these premises.
