5. At 0030 on October 14, 2006, Patient A began receiving his first unit of red blood
cells with no apparent reaction being noted by nursing staff.

6. At 0320, a second unit of red blood cells was started with no reaction being noted
at 0345. Patient A reported some chest discomfort at 0415, noting that it did not radiate and it was
just an ache in the center of his chest. His vitals were normal, but he had an oxygen saturation
level of 91% and was given oxygen.

7. Respondent was notified of Patient A’s condition at 0420 and she indicated that the
blood should be slowed down and to give Patient A Tylenol. Respondent did not personally assess
Patient A.

8. Patient A at 0455 reported that he was still having some chest discomfort. Patient A
then started snorting respiration and did not respond verbally. Nursing staff called Respondent and
the second unit of blood cells was discontinued.

9. At 0500, a code blue was called, resuscitation efforts were made and Patient A was
intubated and transferred to intensive care.

10. Respondent’s shift ended at 0700 and she transferred the care of Patient A to the
physician coming on shift.

11. A pulmonary consultation was performed while Patient A was in ICU which noted
an impression of S/P ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation with cardiac arrest, r/o cardiac
ischemia, possible cardiogenic shock, as well as probable cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The
consult note further indicated that Patient A was in the process of being transferred to another
hospital for further cardiac evaluation and support.

12. Patient A was transferred to Valley Hospital in Las Vegas at 1500 on
October 14, 2006. Patient A died on October 17, 2006, with the immediate cause of death being
listed as cardiac arrest.

Count I

13. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,

to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

14. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds for initiating discipline
against a licensee.

15. Respondent committed malpractice as defined by NAC 630.040 when she failed to
personally evaluate Patient A after initially being contacted by nursing staff and advised that
Patient A was complaining of chest discomfort which may have resulted in a higher suspicion of a
cardiac event transpiring and when she failed to further investigate Patient A’s chest discomfort
and accordingly is in violation of NRS 630.301(4).

16. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against her and give her notice that she may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service
of the Complaint;

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a
formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
determines to impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical
Practice Act (Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 630) committed by Respondent,

4. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Respondent its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the
sanctions imposed; and
