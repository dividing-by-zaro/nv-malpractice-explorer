COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
of Charles N. Held, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D. and Ms. Valerie Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Michael Kaplan, M.D., hereinafter referred to as
Respondent, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint,
stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in suspended-indefinitely status (License No.
5983). Respondent was originally licensed on December 2, 1989 by the Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes and
was licensed in active status until March 14, 2011.

2. On or about December 9, 2011, Respondent purchased and received a GE Logiq
200 MD Alpha Ultrasound System and GE MTZ 6.5 MHz Endocavity Transducer from Providian
Medical Equipment. The ultrasound system, in conjunction with the endocavity transducer and a
needle guid@, may be utilized in specific urological procedures, including prostate biopsies, gold
fiducial marker placements, and Visicoil marker placement.

3. Needle guides were provided with the ultrasound system and transducer; however
the guides provided initially were not the appropriate guides for use with the transducer.

4. On or about December 15, 2010, GE Endo Kit-GE E8C needle guides were sent via
over night shipping from Civco Medical Solutions. The GE Endo Kit-GE E8C needle guides are
disposable and are single-use only. The GE Endo Kit-GE E8C needle guides are purchased by the
box; each box containing twenty-four single-use needle guides. Each box contains a copy of the
“Endoscopy Disposable Needle Guide” reference guide from Civco. The reference guide states
that “[d]isposable components are packaged sterile and are single-use only”. The reference guide
does not include any instructions for cleaning the needle guides; rather it directs single-use
components to be disposed of as infectious waste.

5. Respondent’s office received shipments containing one box of GE Endo Kit-GE
E8C_ needle guides, which were shipped on December 15, 2010, February 4, 2011 and
March 7, 2011.

6. Between December 15, 2010 and March 11, 2011 a minimum of 115 procedures
involving Patients 1-115, whose identities are not revealed to protect their privacy but whose
identities have been provided to Respondent, requiring needle guides were performed in
Respondent’s Henderson office. Based on the number of needle guides shipped to Respondent’s
office, there were not enough disposable needle guides for all procedures that were performed
during this time period.

7. After procedures using the disposable needle guides, medical assistants would
attempt to clean and disinfect the needle guides by running them under water, attempt to scrape
out any remaining tissue or blood without using a brush and would then soak them in Cidex
solution and allow them to dry. Often bits of tissue or blood would remain after attempted
cleaning and disinfecting. Guides were disposed of after becoming too bloody.

8. Interviews conducted with staff indicated that they were instructed to reuse the
needle guides after procedures and continued to do so into the month of March 2011.

9. Respondent has admitted to reusing the needle guides.

10. On March 14, 2011, Respondent was served with an Order from the Investigative
Committee pursuant to NRS 630.326 summarily suspending his license to practice medicine based

on the preliminary findings of the investigation.

Count I

11. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

12. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds for initiating discipline
against a licensee.

13. Respondent committed malpractice as defined by NAC 630.040 when he
knowingly allowed the reprocessing of disposable, single-use needle guides used during the
performance of urologic procedures and reuse of said disposable, single-use needle guides during
the time period set forth above, thus failing to use the reasonable care skill, or knowledge
ordinarily used under similar circumstances in his treatment of Patients 1-115 and, accordingly, is
in violation of NRS 630.301(4).

14. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

Count II

15. NRS 630.306(7) provides that the continual failure to exercise the skill or
diligence or use the methods ordinarily exercised under the same circumstances by physicians in
good standing practicing in the same specialty or field is grounds for initiating disciplinary action
against a licensee.

16. Respondent, in knowingly allowing the reprocessing of disposable, single-use
needle guides used during the performance of urologic procedures and reusing said disposable,
single-use needle guides during the time period set forth above shows a continual failure to
exercise the skill or diligence ordinarily exercised under the same circumstances by physicians in
good standing practicing in the same specialty or field and therefore constitutes a violation of
NRS 630.306(7).

17. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.
