COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed at
the time filing of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Allan Jeffrey Stahl, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the provisions of
NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges
and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent's license is currently listed as active status (License No. 6419), and has
been so licensed since March 21, 1992 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a seventy-eight year old (78) male at the time of the incidents in
question. His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On February 22, 2010, Patient A presented to Summerlin Hospital for elective
placement of a permanent pacemaker by Respondent. As Respondent began to insert the pacemaker,
complications arose.

4. Respondent inadvertently placed the left ventricle. Respondent further failed to

recognize the incorrect placement.

5. Respondent then made multiple attempts to place the atrial lead. It was inserted,
repositioned and removed. The placement of a new lead was subsequently attempted several times.
Finally, the atrial lead was inserted and remained off. A lead revision was planned for the following
day.

6. The attempted placement of the pacemaker took almost two (2) hours. It was never
adequately accomplished by Respondent.

7. Significantly, Respondent missed at least six (6) signs/symptoms that indicated
problems with the pacemaker placement during the course of the attempted placement. Any one of
these signs/symptoms should have alerted Respondent to the erroneous placement of the guide wire
and leads.

8. These signs/symptoms include pulsatile flow through the puncture needle, the
abnormal path of the guide wire, the bleeding around the sheath(s) as they entered the artery, the
abnormal path of the ventricular pacing electrode, the abnormal deflection of the paced beats on the
physiologic monitor and the atypical shape of the right atrial lead when advanced.

Count I

9. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

10. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a
physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under
similar circumstances.

11. | Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds for
initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

12. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under the same or similar circumstances by, among other things, when he failed and omitted to
recognize the aforementioned signs/symptoms during the attempted placement of the pacemaker;
and, failed and omitted to follow-up on the signs/symptoms to ensure that the pacemaker was placed

correctly.
