ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION

On August 19, 2010, Board Staff presented evidence and information to the Investigative
Committee, composed of Theodore Berndt, M.D., Chair, Valerie Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF,
Member, and Michael Fischer, M.D., regarding Karen Arcotta, M.D. Upon review of the evidence
and information presented by Board Staff, the Investigative Committee hereby IMMEDIATELY
SUSPENDS the medical license of Karen Arcotta, M.D. (hereinafter “Dr. Arcotta”) pursuant to
NRS 630.326(1) based upon the following preliminary findings:

1, Dr. Arcotta currently holds a license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada and
was originally licensed on July 9, 1983.

2. Dr. Arcotta recently submitted to a psychiatric evaluation ordered by the
Investigative Committee pursuant to the provisions of Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.318.

3. The findings of the evaluation indicate that Dr. Arcotta is currently not able to safely
practice medicine.

The Committee believes that due to the findings of the recent psychiatric evaluation
indicating that Dr. Arcotta is not currently able to safely practice medicine that the health, safety and
welfare of the public is at imminent risk of harm and that a summary suspension of
Dr. Arcotta’s license to practice medicine is necessary to remove said risk of imminent harm to the
health, safety and welfare of the public. Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):


N



IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the license to practice medicine care in the state of
Nevada of Karen Arcotta, M.D. (License No. 4896) is hereby suspended until further order of the
Investigative Committee or Board; and

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing be set within forty-five (45) days of this Order
regarding this matter pursuant to NRS 630.326(2) to determine the appropriateness of this
suspension, unless the parties mutually agree to a longer period of time.

DATED this 22" day of September, 2011.
