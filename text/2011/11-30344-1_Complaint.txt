COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed at
the time filing of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and
Valerie J. Clark, Member, having a reasonable basis to believe that Kord Thomas Strebel, M.D.,
hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues
its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent's license is currently in active status (License No. 11468), and has been
so licensed since July 1, 2005 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a thirty-five year old (35) female at the time of the incidents in question.
Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On June 17, 2010, Patient A presented to Respondent seeking a procedure for
permanent birth control. Respondent performed an examination of Patient A, and a vaginal
medicinal insert was prescribed.

4. Patient A was instructed to insert the medication on the night of June 24, 2010 and
return to Respondent the next day, on June 25, 2010. She did so and subsequently presented to

Respondent on June 25, 2010 with 1.4 cm. of fetal tissue discharge. Upon immediate examination,
Patient A spontaneously passed the remaining products of conception.

5. Unfortunately, a pregnancy test was not administered to Patient A on June 24, 2010
immediately preceding the insertion of the medication. Further, the medical records are in conflict
on the actual administration of pregnancy tests to Patient A. It is not clear if pregnancy tests were

administered to Patient A on June 17, 2010 or June 25, 2010, or both dates.

Count I
6. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.
7. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a

physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under
similar circumstances.

8. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds for
initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

9. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under the same or similar circumstances by, among other things, when he failed and omitted to
administer a pregnancy test on Patient A immediately preceding the insertion of the medication on
June 24, 2010 by Patient A.

10. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State

Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

Count IT
11. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set
forth herein.
12. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.3062(1) provides that the failure to maintain

timely, legible, accurate and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care
of a patient is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

13. Respondent failed to ensure that Patient A's pregnancy tests were correctly and timely
recorded in the medical records. It is difficult to determine, or accurately identify when, if ever, a
pregnancy test was administered to Patient A prior to the June 25, 2010 appointment.

14. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service of
the Complaint.

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a formal
hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
determines to impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical Practice
Act (Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 630) committed by Respondent; and

4. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Respondent its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions
imposed; and

5. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners take such other and further action
as may be just and proper in these premises.
