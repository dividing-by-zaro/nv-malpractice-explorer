COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time of filing owas approved by Theodore Berndt, M.D.,
Ms. Valerie Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, and Michael Fischer, M.D. having a reasonable basis to
believe that Andrew Welch, M.D., hereinafter referred to as "Respondent," has violated the
provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative
Committee's charges and allegations, as follows: |

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 3713), and was so
licensed on December 2, 1978, by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a fifty-two year old male at the time of the incidents in question. His
true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint:

3. Patient A first presented to Respondent in April 2008 with chronic left knee pain
after an MRI performed in March 2008 indicated a medial meniscus tear and chondromalacia.

4. Patient A underwent outpatient arthroscopic surgery on his left knee performed by
Respondent at North Vista Hospital.

5. Patient A was seen by Respondent on fairly consistent basis through

December 2008 for post-operative care as well as care after he twisted his knee.

6. In June 2009, Patient A returned to Respondent with complaints of right knee pain.
An MRI was performed after which it was recommended that Patient A undergo arthroscopic
surgery on the right knee.

7. On August 13, 2009, Patient A presented to North Vista Hospital for performance
of outpatient arthroscopic surgery of his right knee to be performed by Respondent.

8. Patient signed an informed consent and authorization for anesthesia indicating that
the procedure he was anticipating was a right knee arthroscopic procedure.

9. Arthroscopic surgery was performed by Respondent, however when Patient A
awoke, it was discovered that Respondent had performed arthroscopic surgery on Patient A’s left
knee rather than that right knee. With Patient A’s consent, a second procedure was undertaken
shortly thereafter to perform the procedure on the correct knee.

Count I

10. | Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) section 630.040 defines malpractice as “the
failure of a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge
ordinarily used under similar circumstances.”

11. Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is
ground for initiating discipline against a licensee.

12. | Respondent committed malpractice as defined by NAC 630.040 when he
performed arthroscopic surgery on Patient A’s left knee rather than his right when Patient A’s
records prior to the procedure clearly indicate issues with his right knee and he signed consent for
arthroscopic surgery of his right knee.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service

of the Complaint.

formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
determines to impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical
Practice Act (Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 630) committed by Respondent; and

4. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Respondent its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the
sanctions imposed; and

5. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners take such other and further
action as may be just and proper in these premises.
