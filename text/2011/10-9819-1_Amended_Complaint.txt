AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),

composed of Charles N. Held, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., and Ms. Valerie Clark, BSN,
RHU, LUTCF, by and through Edward O. Cousineau, Deputy Executive Director for the Board
and Attorney for the Investigative Committee, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Benjamin Venger, M.D., hereinafter referred to as "Respondent," has violated the provisions of
NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent was actively licensed to practice medicine by the Board on
September 19, 1987, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes,
and at all times addressed herein was so licensed. Respondent practices medicine in Las Vegas
and his indicated specialty to the Board is Neurosurgery.

2. Patient A was a fourteen-year-old male at the time of the events at issue. His true
identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation
served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A presented to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas on June 25, 2004, with a two-
week history of headaches, fever and confused. Respondent was called for a neurosurgical consult

that morning where he noted abnormalities of Patient A’s frontal scalp and garbled speech. Tests

showed that Patient A had an elevated white blood cell count and high erythrocyte sedimentation
rate. A CT scan of Patient A’s head showed a mass effect on the left side of Patient A’s brain and
a cerebral edema. Based upon these inputs, Respondent ordered a cerebral angiogram and drug
screen; the results of both were negative. A MRI of Patient A’s head accomplished later in the day
confirmed the previous CT scan findings of a left side mass effect and diffuse sinusitis.

4, Patient A’s circumstance did not improve. Around 0730 on June 26, 2004,
Respondent again conducted an evaluation of Patient A. At the time of the evaluation, Patient A
was comatose, unresponsive to pain or stimulus. Respondent spoke to Patient A’s family around
1430 and recommended interventional surgery. Consent from Patient A’s family was obtained,
and the surgery began at approximately 2100. Interoperatively, Respondent discovered a subdural
empyema and multiple intracranial abscesses with intracranial pressure. In response, Respondent
performed a frontotemporoparietal craniotomy with evacuation of the intracranial abscesses and
subdural empyema and decompressive craniectomy.

5. After the surgical procedure, Patient A’s outlook was poor and Patient A’s chances
of survival were deemed minimal. After discussion with Respondent, Patient A’s family directed
that life support measures for Patient A be removed. Patient A expired at approximately 0100 on
June 27, 2004.

6. Malpractice is defined at NAC 630.040 as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.”

7. Respondent’s care and treatment of Patient A constitutes malpractice as defined by
NAC 630.040 as Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when the combination of fever, headache, sinusitis, elevated white
blood cell count, and high erythrocyte sedimentation failed to alert Respondent to the fact that
Patient A could be suffering from a subdural empyema. The aforementioned information was
available to Respondent on June 25, 2004, but Respondent did not initiate surgical intervention on
Patient A until the evening of June 26, 2004.

8. Based upon the foregoing, Respondent has violated NRS 630.301(4), and is subject
to discipline as provided by NRS 630.352.
