COMPLAINT

of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and Valerie J. Clark,
Member, at the time it approved and authorized the filing of this complaint having a reasonable
basis to believe that Kenneth Cecil Westfield, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has
violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the
Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent's license is currently in active status (License No. 3953), and has been
so licensed since January 1, 1980 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a sixty-four (64) year old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On or about April 11, 2007, Patient A presented to the Westfield Eye Center
("Westfield") complaining of constant blurry vision for the past six (6) months. Patient A was
examined, not by Respondent, and right eye cataract surgery with lens implant was scheduled.

4. On May 24, 2007, Respondent performed the cataract extraction along with

performing the lens implant. During the surgery, something happened that is not included in the

medical records, and a second lens was implanted by Respondent. Later on retained lens
fragments and the first new lens were found deposited into the posterior segment of the patient's
eye.

5. On May 25, 2007, the day after surgery, Patient A returned to Westfield and was
not seen by Respondent, but by an optometrist. Significantly, the attending optometrist was not
informed of any intraoperative complications by Respondent. Patient A's eye pressure was noted
as high with unspecified white cells observed in the anterior chamber.

6. Patient A returned to Westfield on June 1, 2007. Her vision was gone in the right
eye. The intraocular pressure was measured at 52 mm. The attending optometrist released the
pressure in the eye.

7. On June 4, 2007, Patient A complained again of pain and loss of vision in her right
eye. The intraocular pressure was measured at 74 mm. The attending ophthalmologist, again not
Respondent, administered some medications and the pressure dropped to 41 mm.

8. As the ophthalmologist examined the eye, lens fragments and the first new lens
were finally identified in the anterior chamber of Patient A's right eye. Medications were
prescribed, and Patient A was referred to a retina specialist.

9. On June 5, 2007, Patient A saw a retina specialist. The retina specialist found
continued high intraocular pressure. Large retained lens fragments were observed as well as the
first dislocated new lens.

10. Subsequently on June 8, 2007, Patient A underwent vitrectomy, lensectomy and
removal of posterior chamber intraocular lens. Ultimately, Patient A never recovered sight in her
right eye.
