4. All of the above allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if
fully set forth herein.
5. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(3) provides that any disciplinary action,

and therefore constitutes a violation of the provisions of NRS §630.301(3).

Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
