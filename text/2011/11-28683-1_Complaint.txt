COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed at
the time filing of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Chairman, Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., Member, and
Donna A. Ruthe, Member, having a reasonable basis to believe that William Shane Kyle, M.D.,
hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues
its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent's license is currently listed as active status (License No. 10972), and has
been so licensed since June 7, 2004 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a fifty-six (56) year old female at the time of the incidents in question.
Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On February 26, 2007, Patient A presented to Harmon Medical Center (HMC), an
urgent care center, with a shoulder dislocation and fracture. She had fallen bluntly on her left
shoulder.

4. X-rays confirmed a fracture/dislocation of the left shoulder. Despite this, Respondent
did not perform manipulation of the shoulder in order to reduce the disclocation. Respondent did

not perform the manipulation due to the existing fracture.

5. Respondent immobilized the arm and instructed Patient A to see an orthopaedic
specialist within three (3) days. This instruction of delay constitutes malpractice.
6. Patient A went for reduction of the dislocation on February 28, 2007. The pain

continued, however.
7. The pain was later identified as arising from significant nerve damage to the brachial

plexus nerve caused by the delay in reduction of the dislocation.

8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.
9. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a

physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under
similar circumstances.

10. | Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds for
initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

11. | Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under the same or similar circumstances by, among other things, when he failed and omitted to.
advise Patient A to immediately seek a higher level of care for shoulder joint reduction and
stabilization.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
