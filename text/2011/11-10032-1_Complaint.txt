COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed,
at the time filing was approved, of Charles N. Held, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D. and
Ms. Valerie Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Mary Anne D. Phillips, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Dr. Phillips, has violated the provisions of
NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Dr. Phillips is currently licensed in active status (License No. 7635), and was
originally licensed on December 21, 1995 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Dr. Phillips primarily practices in the area of pain management.

3. Patient A is a forty-nine-year-old male. His true identity is not disclosed to protect
his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation served on Dr. Phillips along
with a copy of this Complaint.

4. Patient A was initially treated by Dr. Phillips in California; however after relocating
to Nevada, he began to see her in Nevada as well for treatment of lower back and hip pain.

5. Dr. Phillips prescribed controlled substances for pain to Patient A between

November 2003 and April 2010, primarily Norco.

6. Patient A resides in Reno, Nevada and has resided there for several years; however
he did continue to see Dr. Phillips in person in Las Vegas on multiple occasions. Patient A
continued to receive prescriptions for controlled substances for pain from Dr. Phillips until early
2010; however, he has not seen Dr. Phillips in person for over two years. He would talk with
Dr. Phillips by telephone and prescriptions would be called into his chosen pharmacy.

7. Although Dr. Phillips maintained records for Patient A during the time she
prescribed controlled substances to him, her records indicate that Patient A was seen in person and
his vitals were taken.

8. On April 15, 2010, Dr. Phillips wrote a prescription for Oxycodone for Patient A
which was filled at a Walgreens Pharmacy in North Las Vegas. The prescription was picked up by
Dr. Phillips’ husband. Patient A had no knowledge that this prescription was written and he did
not authorize anyone to pick up such a prescription for him.

9, Dr. Phillips’ medical records for Patient A include an entry dated April 15, 2010,
indicating that she saw Patient A on that day.

10. Patient A was verified to be out of the country on April 15, 2010. Patient A
departed the United States on April 5, 2010 and did not return until May 10, 2010.

11. Patient B is a forty-nine-year-old male. Patient B was a patient at the Las Vegas
Pain Institute (LVPI) starting in 2007 for treatment of neck and arm pain related to a work
accident. Patient B began to see Dr. Phillips at LVPI in early 2008.

12. Dr. Phillips prescribed controlled substances for pain for Patient B between March
2008 and January 2010 while Patient B was being treated by other practitioners and receiving
controlled substances from those other practitioners.

13. On February 14 2009, Dr. Phillips and Patient B were married and remain married
to date.

15. Dr. Phillips engaged in deceptive conduct when she prepared a medical record for
treatment provided to Patient A on April 15, 2010 and wrote a prescription for controlled substances
for him which was picked up by Patient B, her husband, when Patient A was out of the country on
April 15, 2010.

16. By reason of the foregoing, Dr. Phillips is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

Count II

17. NRS 630.306(2)(c) provides that a violation of a regulation adopted by the State
Board of Pharmacy is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

18. NAC 639.945(1)(o) prohibits prescribing a drug as a prescribing practitioner to a
patient with whom the prescribing practitioner does not have a bona fide therapeutic relationship
as defined by NAC 639.945(3)(a) and (b).

19. Dr. Phillips violated NAC 639.945(1)(0) when she prescribed controlled substances
for Patient A over an extended period of time but failed to physically examine Patient A for
approximately two years and therefore did not have a bona fide therapeutic relationship with him.

20. By her violation of NAC 639.945(1)(0), Dr. Phillips is in violation of NRS
630.306(2)(c) and is therefore subject to discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical
Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

Count Il

21. NRS 630.306(3) provides that prescribing any controlled substance to others
except as authorized by law is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

22. NRS 453.381(1) prohibits the prescribing of a schedule II controlled substance to a
spouse except in cases of emergency.

23. Dr. Phillips violated NRS 453.381(1) when she prescribed schedule II controlled
substances to Patient B between February 2009 and January 2010 after they were married.

24. By her violation of NRS 453.381(1), Dr. Philips is in violation of NRS 630.306(3)
and is therefore subject to discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided

in NRS 630.352.

Count IV

25. | NRS 630.3062(1) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate and
complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds for
initiating discipline against a physician.

26. Dr. Phillips violated NRS 630.3062(1) when she failed to keep accurate records for
Patient A when she failed to note in her records that she did not see Patient A in person and
instead spoke with him by phone and when she created a fraudulent record for Patient A on April
15, 2010 indicating that she had seen Patient A when in fact he was out of the country.

27. By reason of the foregoing, Dr. Phillips is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Dr. Phillips notice of the
charges herein against her and give her notice that she may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service
