and moves for Hearing Officer Jill Greiner to order Marilyn Atkins, R.R.T. (hereinafter “Ms.

Ms. Atkins admitted to the two counts alleged in the Complaint and the Board revoked

Ms. Atkins’ license to practice respiratory care in the state of Nevada, however the revocation was
stayed and Ms. Atkins was placed on probation for a period of forty-eight months with the
following conditions:

1) Respondent shall enter into and complete a contract with the PRN-PRN program through
Monte Vista Hospital and shall comply with all terms of her contract (see Exhibit 3);

2) Respondent shall sign all necessary releases with the PRN-PRN program for the board to
access her records from the PRN-PRN program;

3) Respondent shall submit to any additional random hair or urine screens as required by the
Board;

4) Respondent shall provide the Compliance Officer of the Nevada State Board of Medical
Examiners with the best and most expeditious manner of contacting her;

5) Respondent shall use no narcotic pain medication without notify the Compliance Officer
prior to such use and shall provide the Compliance Officer with a letter from her treatment provider
that use of such narcotic medication is medically indicated;

6) Respondent shall notify the Compliance Officer of where she will be practicing respiratory
care at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to starting to practice;

7) Respondent shall pay any costs associated with monitoring of her compliance with these
terms of probation. Respondent shall remit to the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners such
costs within thirty (30) days of being presented with an invoice for said compliance costs;

8) Respondent shall reimburse the Board the reasonable costs and expenses incurred in the
investigation and prosecution of this case, the current amount being $1,233.35. These costs shall be
paid to the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners within ninety (90) days of the acceptance of
this Agreement by the Board;

Ms. Atkins has failed to comply with condition 1 of the Settlement, Waiver and Consent
Agreement in that she failed to comply with her contract with PRN-PRN program in that she has
failed to attend meetings as required by section #3 of her PRN-PRN contract and as a result of this

non-compliance has been terminated from the program (see Exhibit 4). Ms. Atkins has also failed

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL

Sh

BET
Se

Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners




to comply with condition 1 of the Settlement, Waiver and Consent Agreement when she failed to
comply with her contract with PRN-PRN when that she failed to abstain from mood-altering drugs
except on prescription from her family physician after consultation with PRN-PRN as required by
section #4 of her contract. Ms. Atkins submitted to both a hair and urine screen on January 27,
2011. The results of the hair test show positive findings for methamphetamine, codeine and
hydrocodone and the results of the urine screen show positive findings for Tramadol (see Exhibit
5).

Ms. Atkins has also failed to comply with condition 5 of the Settlement, Waiver and
Consent Agreement when she failed to provide the Compliance Officer with a letter, or any other
correspondence, from her treating physician indicating that narcotic pain medications, such as

codeine, hydrocodone and/or Tramadol, were medically necessary for Ms. Atkins.

ARGUMENT
Ms. Atkins has failed to comply with the terms of the Settlement, Waiver and Consent
Agreement as alleged above. The actions of Ms. Atkins show that she cannot comply with the
terms of her contract with PRN-PRN as she has been terminated from the program for non-
compliance and her use of legal and illegal substances show that she cannot or will not comply
with the other terms and conditions of her settlement agreement with this Board. Accordingly, the
Investigative Committee believes it appropriate and just to impose the stayed revocation of Ms.
Atkins’ license to practice respiratory care in Nevada.
CONCLUSION
The Investigative Committee requests that the Hearing Officer order Ms. Atkins to appear
before the adjudicating members of the Board, at 1105 Terminal Way, Suite 301, in Reno,
Nevada, on Friday, March 11, 2011 at 9:30 a.m., or as soon thereafter as the matter may be
heard, to show cause why the stayed revocation of her license to practice respiratory care in the
state of Nevada should not be rescinded and her license should not be revoked due to her failure to
comply with the Agreement which was adopted by order on September 10, 2010. In lieu of

appearing before the Board in Reno, Ms Atkins may appear by video conference from the offices

COMPLAINT “ANINERS

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time of approval of the filing of the instant complaint, of Charles N. Held, M.D.,
Benjamin Rodriguez, M.D. and Ms. Jean Stoess, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Marilyn Atkins, R.R.T., hereinafter referred to as Ms. Atkins, has violated the provisions of
NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Ms. Atkins currently holds an active license to practice respiratory care (License
no. RC802) and was so licensed on December 7, 2002 after appearing before the Board.
Ms. Atkins received her license on the condition that she successfully continues to participate with
the Nevada Health Professionals Assistance Foundation (NHPAF) due to concerns about past
issues with prescription controlled substances.

2. In February 2008, NHPAF indicated it could no longer advocate for Ms. Atkins due
to Ms. Atkins only being in partial compliance with the program.

3. Ms. Atkins was ordered to submit to a urine and hair drug screen in March 2008 the
results of which were negative.

4. Ms. Atkins returned to the NHPAF program in April 2008, however, in June 2008,
the Board was once again notified that Ms. Atkins was out of compliance with the program. A

patient drug utilization profile in July 2008 indicated that Ms. Atkins had been receiving

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL

Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

1105 Terminal Way #301
Reno, Nevada 89502

(775) 688-2559


hydrocodone prescriptions for the past several months and Ms. Atkins admitted to Board staff that
she occasionally used the substance for various ailments.

5. In September 2008, Ms. Atkins was allowed to change drug treatment programs
and was ordered by an Investigative Committee of the Board to present to the PRN program
through Monte Vista Hospital and enter into a contract for drug treatment and monitoring.

Ms. Atkins signed a treatment contract with the PRN program on October 15, 2008.

6. In June 2009, the PRN program terminated Ms. Atkins for failing to follow her
contract with the program.

7. A recent drug utilization profile indicates that Ms. Atkins has been receiving
prescriptions for hydrocodone between January 2009 through October 2009.

Count I

8. Nevada: Revised Statute Section 630.3065(2)(a) provides that willful failure to
comply with an order of the Board or of an investigative committee of the Board is grounds for
initiating discipline against a licensee.

9. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.540(23) provides that disciplinary action
may be initiated against a respiratory therapist licensee if they have violated any provision that
would subject a practitioner of medicine to discipline pursuant to NRS 630.301 to 630.3065
inclusive.

10. Ms. Atkins failed to follow the contract she entered into with the PRN program
through Monte Vista Hospital and thus has violated NRS 630.3065(2)(a) and accordingly is
subject to discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section
630.555 of the Nevada Administrative Code.

Count II

11. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.306(1) provides that the inability to practice
medicine with reasonable skill and safety because of use of narcotics is grounds for initiating
discipline against a licensee.

12. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.540(23) provides that disciplinary action

may be initiated against a respiratory therapist licensee if they have violated any provision that

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL

Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

Reno, Nevada 89502

(775) 688-2559




would subject a practitioner of medicine to discipline pursuant to NRS 630.301 to 630.3065
inclusive.

13. Ms. Atkins has not completed a treatment program for the use of narcotic
prescription medication and continues to utilize them creating an inability to practice respiratory
care with reasonable skill and safety and thus has violated NRS 630.306(1) and accordingly is
subject to discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section
630.555 of the Nevada Administrative Code.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners fix a time and place for a
formal hearing;

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Ms. Atkins notice of the
charges herein against her, and when appropriate, the time and place set for the hearing, and the
possible sanctions against her;

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
wishes to impose for the violation or violations committed by Ms. Atkins;

4. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Ms. Atkins its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the
sanctions imposed; and

5. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners take such other and further
action as may be just and proper in these premises.
