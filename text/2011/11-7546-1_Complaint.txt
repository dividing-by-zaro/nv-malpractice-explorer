Ms. Valerie Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, and Michael Fischer, M.D. having a reasonable basis to

licensed on July 1, 1995 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A, is a forty-nine-year-old female patient who has been a regular patient of
Respondent for several years. Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her
identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this
Complaint.

3. Between February 2006 and September 2010, Respondent ordered controlled
substances and dangerous drugs from Henry Schein, a pharmaceutical wholesaler. Drugs received
from Henry Schein must either be administered or dispensed to a patient by an individual licensed

to do so in accordance with federal and state laws.

4. As a regular patient of Respondent, Patient A was prescribed both dangerous drugs
and controlled substances which were dispensed through licensed pharmacies. .

5. A licensed physician may only dispense a dangerous drug or controlled substance
in the state of Nevada if that individual holds a certificate for registration to dispense issued by the
Nevada State Board of Pharmacy in accordance with Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) 639.742(1). Respondent does not, nor has she ever held a certificate of registration to
dispense in the state of Nevada.

6. Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) section 639.745 delineates the records that
must be kept by a practitioner regarding any dangerous drugs or controlled substances dispensed
by the practitioner and the manner in which they may be dispensed. Respondent did not keep
records regarding the controlled substances and dangerous drugs she dispensed as required by law
or dispense said substances in the manner required by NAC 639.745.

7. Respondent dispensed many of the dangerous drugs and controlled substances she
purchased through Henry Schein to Patient A. Patient A would often fax Respondent a request for
the dangerous drugs and controlled substances she needed or wanted and would then pay
Respondent for the drugs.

8. Respondent also sold Patient A dexamethasone sodium phosphate, a dangerous
drug, which Patient A utilized in her physical therapy practice. Respondent knew or should have
known that that Patient A was not lawfully allowed to possess and administer dexamethasone
sodium phosphate.

Count I

9. Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) section 630.306(2)(c) provides that engaging in
conduct which is in violation of a regulation adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy is grounds

10. NAC 639.945(1)(k), a regulation adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy, provides
that performing any act, task operation for which licensure, certification or registration is required
without the required license, certificate or registration is prohibited conduct.

11. NAC 639.742(1) requires any practitioner who wishes to dispense controlled
substances or dangerous drugs to apply to the Board of Pharmacy for a certificate of registration to
dispense controlled substances or dangerous drugs.

12. Respondent dispensed controlled substances and dangerous drugs to Patient A and
possibly other patients but has never held a certificate of registration to dispense controlled
substances or dangerous drugs and therefore is in violation of a regulation adopted by the Nevada
State Board of Pharmacy and accordingly is in violation of NRS 630.306(2)(c).

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

Count II

for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

15. NAC 639.945(1)(g), a regulation adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy, provides
that supplying or diverting drugs which are legally sold in pharmacies or by wholesalers, so that
unqualified persons can circumvent any law pertaining to the legal sale of such articles is
prohibited conduct.

16. Respondent supplied Patient A with dexamethasone sodium phosphate, a
dangerous drug that Patient A is not licensed to legally procure, for use in Patient A’s physical
therapy practice and accordingly Respondent’s actions are in violation of NAC 639.945(1)(g) and
therefore her conduct is in violation of NRS 630.306(2)(c).

17. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

Count II

19. | Respondent’s actions as described in the paragraphs above show that she dispensed
both dangerous drugs and controlled substances without a certificate of registration and has failed
to comply with the provisions of NAC 639.745 in dispensing any dangerous drugs or controlled
substances and is accordingly in violation of NRS 630.306(3).

20. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:
