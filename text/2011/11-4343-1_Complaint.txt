COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and
Valerie J. Clark, Member, having a reasonable basis to believe that Gerald Wayne Dunn, M.D.,
hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby
issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as
follows:

1. Respondent's license is currently in active status (License No. 2827), and has been
so licensed since June 5, 1974 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a fifty-six year old (56) female at the time of the incidents in question.
Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On October 5, 2004, Patient A suffered a seizure and was admitted to Southern
Hills Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. After an MRI, the initial diagnosis was atypical viral
encephalitis with a differential diagnosis including low grade glioma, psuedotumor or less likely

infarct.

4, A follow-up MRI brain scan was performed on Patient A on January 6, 2005. The
radiologist stated that the MRI results were representative of atypical encephalitis versus low
grade glioma. Thus, this subsequent MRI was essentially identical with the October 5, 2004
findings. No observable changes in the MRI results indicated a tumor and ruled out encephalitis.

5. Respondent saw Patient A beginning on December 19, 2005. Respondent
continued to see Patient A four more times up through August 15, 2006.

6. At no time did Respondent compare the October 5, 2004 results to the January 6,
2005 results. Respondent also failed to review and report the results of the January 6, 2005 to
Patient A during his course of medical care. Respondent further failed to order a new MRI scan at
any time.

7. Had Respondent compared the two MRI results, reviewed the most recent MRI, or
ordered a new one, he would have been able to inform the patient of the true gravity of the

diagnosis and prognosis, inevitably fatal, and perhaps achieved a better outcome.

Count I
8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.
9. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of

a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

10. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

11. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under the same or similar circumstances when he failed and omitted to compare the results of the
two MRIs; failed and omitted to review the January 6, 2005 MRI at anytime; failed to report the
MRI results, and related diagnosis/prognosis of the January 6, 2005 MRI at anytime to Patient A;
and, failed to order another MRI scan at any time.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State

Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
