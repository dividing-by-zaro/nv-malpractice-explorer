The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),

composed of Charles N. Held, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., and Ms. Valerie Clark, BSN,
RHU, LUTCF, by and through Edward O. Cousineau, Deputy Executive Director for the Board

NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent was actively licensed to practice medicine by the Board on
July 1, 1993, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and was
so until July 1, 2009. Respondent’s current licensure status is automatically suspended.

2. Pursuant to standard procedure, the Investigative Committee, through Board staff,
requested Respondent to provide a response and records related to two matters before the
Investigative Committee. Initial requests were made in January of 2009. Similar requests were
made in April, May and August of 2009. None of these requests were met with a response.

3. On September 16, 2009, Respondent was personally served with two orders from
the Investigative Committee requesting a response and records related to the matter before the
Investigative Committee. The two orders indicated that the requested materials were to be

provided to the Investigative Committee within ten days of service of the order.
