HII



The Board, after due consideration of the record, evidence and law, and being fully advised
in the premises, makes its FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ORDER in

this matter as follows:

FINDINGS OF FACT

I

Respondent has held an active license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada since
July 29, 1980.

Il.

On February 22, 2011, the Investigative Committee filed the Complaint in this matter
alleging violations of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

III.

On September 27, 2011, a formal hearing was held before an appointed hearing officer on
the allegations contained within the Complaint. Respondent was present at the formal hearing and
represented himself. The Investigative Committee was represented by
Edward O. Cousineau, J.D., Deputy Executive Director for the Board.

IV.

Evidence presented at the formal hearing established that the underlying patient’s age,
complaints of chest pain previous to admission, and elevated troponin level should have caused
Respondent to continue with further evaluation and testing prior to discharging the patient, or in
the alternative, transferring the patient to a more advanced medical facility with invasive cardiac
intervention capability.

The preponderance of evidence in the record as a whole establishes that Respondent’s
care and treatment of the patient at issue fell below the standard of care expected in similar
circumstances.

V.

The Board finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent violated Nevada
Revised Statute 630.301(4) as alleged in the underlying Complaint.




VI.
If any of the foregoing Findings of Fact is more properly deemed a Conclusion of Law, it

may be so construed.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.

I.

The Board has jurisdiction over Respondent.

Il.

Respondent was properly served with notice of the hearing via certified mail at the address
on file with the Board pursuant to NRS and NAC chapters 630 and
NRS chapter 233B.

Il.

The Board concludes that Respondent has violated NRS 630.301(4) as described above,

and accordingly is subject to discipline pursuant to NRS 630.352.
IV.

If any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law is more properly deemed a Finding of Fact, it

may be so construed.
ORDER
Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and good cause

appearing therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:
