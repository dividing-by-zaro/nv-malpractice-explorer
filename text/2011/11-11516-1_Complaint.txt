COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed at

the time filing of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Francis Xavier Del Vecchio, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the provisions
of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent's license is currently in active status (License No. 7962), and has been so
licensed since September 6, 1996 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a sixty-seven year old (67) female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On February 11, 2007, Patient A presented to Desert Springs Hospital at about 0130
HRS. She complained of abdominal pain and had a history of diverticulitis and GI bleed. Her initial
documented blood pressure was 60/30.

4. Another documented blood pressure of Patient A was not taken until 0345 HRS when

it was 62/32. This demonstrates a failure to record Patient A's blood pressure for over two (2) hours.
