4. Previous to the preparation of this Complaint, the Board solicited the services of
an independent medical expert to review the medical records of several patients previously
treated by Respondent. The record review included those of Patients A, B, C, D and E.

5. From approximately November of 2004 to June of 2010, Patient A was prescribed
various types of controlled substances by Respondent. A review of Patient A’s medical records
by the expert determined that Respondent’s prescribing practices for Patient A were excessive
and inconsistent with the appropriate standard of care. Specifically, that Respondent prescribed
significant amounts of controlled substances to Patient A without sufficient medical justification
for Respondent’s continued prescribing of controlled substances. Further, Respondent
considered alternative means of treating the patient’s pain in very minimal instances. And, the
medical records for Patient A were lacking in adequate documentation to ascertain a diagnosis
which justified the protracting prescribing practices by Respondent.

6. From approximately November of 2004 to September of 2010, Patient B was
prescribed various types of controlled substances by Respondent. A review of Patient B’s
medical records by the expert determined that Respondent’s prescribing practices for Patient B
were excessive and inconsistent with the appropriate standard of care. Specifically, that
Respondent prescribed significant amounts of controlled substances to Patient B without
sufficient medical justification for Respondent’s continued prescribing of controlled substances.
Further, Respondent considered alternative means of treating the patient’s pain in very minimal
instances. And, the medical records for Patient B were lacking in adequate documentation to
ascertain a diagnosis which justified the proiracting prescribing practices by Respondent.

7. From approximately June of 2004 to October of 2010, Patient C was prescribed
various types of controlled substances by Respondent. A review of Patient C’s medical records
by the expert determined that Respondent’s prescribing practices for Patient C were excessive
and inconsistent with the appropriate standard of care. Specifically, that Respondent prescribed
significant amounts of controlled substances to Patient C without sufficient medical justification
for Respondent’s continued prescribing of controlled substances. Further, Respondent

considered alternative means of treating the patient’s pain in very minimal instances. And, the

medical records for Patient C were lacking in adequate documentation to ascertain a diagnosis
which justified the protracting prescribing practices by Respondent.

8. From approximately June of 2006 to July of 2010, Patient D was prescribed
various types of controlled substances by Respondent. A review of Patient D’s medical records
by the expert determined that Respondent’s prescribing practices for Patient D were excessive
and inconsistent with the appropriate standard of care. Specifically, that Respondent prescribed
significant amounts of controlled substances to Patient D without sufficient medical justification
for Respondent’s continued prescribing of controlled substances. Further, Respondent
considered alternative means of treating the patient’s pain in very minimal instances. And, the
medical records for Patient D were lacking in adequate documentation to ascertain a diagnosis
which justified the protracting prescribing practices by Respondent.

9. From approximately July of 2005 to September of 2010, Patient E was prescribed
various types of controlled substances by Respondent. A review of Patient E’s medical records
by the expert determined that Respondent’s prescribing practices for Patient E were excessive
and inconsistent with the appropriate standard of care. Specifically, that Respondent prescribed
significant amounts of controlled substances to Patient E without sufficient medical justification
for Respondent’s continued prescribing of controlled substances. Further, Respondent
considered alternative means of treating the patient’s pain in very minimal instances. And, the
medical records for Patient E were lacking in adequate documentation to ascertain a diagnosis
