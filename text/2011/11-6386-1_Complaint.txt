COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),
composed of Charles N. Held, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., and Ms. Valerie Clark, BSN,
RHU, LUTCF, by and through Edward O. Cousineau, Deputy Executive Director for the Board
and Attorney for the Investigative Committee, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Frank V. Rueckl, M.D., hereinafter referred to as "Respondent," has violated the provisions of
NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent was actively licensed to practice medicine by the Board on
October 3, 1981, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and at
all times addressed herein was so licensed. Respondent practices medicine in Las Vegas and his
indicated specialty to the Board is Dermatology.

2. Patient A was a twenty-eight-year-old female at the time of the events at issue. Her
true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A first presented to Respondent on October 6, 2005 for a consultation

regarding pigmentation and acne scars on her face. Thereafter, Patient A was started on a regime

of Accutane and it was recommended that she undergo and a non-ablative resurfacing treatment,
Rhytec Portrait treatment, for her pigmentation issue in the future. Patient A was next seen by
Respondent on November 25, 2005. At that time she was instructed to cease the use of the
Accutane two weeks prior to the Rhytec Portrait treatment, and was provided a prescription for
antibiotics to be started pre-operatively and continued after the treatment.

4. Patient A underwent the procedure on December 8, 2005. Due to continued
redness of her skin and lack of healing, Patient A was started on a new round of antibiotics
towards the end of December. Over the course of the next several months Dr. Rueckl treated
Patient A with topical treatments in an attempt to relieve redness on her face with limited results.
Ultimately, Patient A developed permanent scarring in the areas where the Rhytec Portrait
treatment was accomplished.

5. It is now alleged by the Investigative Committee that Respondent’s care and
treatment of Patient A constitutes malpractice, as Respondent inappropriately prescribed Accutane
based upon Patient A’s medical symptoms, that the performance of the Rhytec Portrait treatment
was accomplished too soon after the use of Accutane was discontinued by Patient A, and that
Respondent should have recognized the need to more thoroughly diagnosis, via cultures, Patient
A’s wounds when they failed to heal more expeditiously.

6. Malpractice is defined at NAC 630.040 as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

7. Based upon the foregoing, Respondent has violated NRS 630.301(4), and is subject
to discipline as provided by NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing;

2. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him, the time
and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions against him,

3. That the Board determine what sanctions it determines to impose for the violation

or violations committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of facts,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed;
5. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these

premises.
