Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Dr. Jianu is currently licensed in active status (License No. 8309), and was

depomedrol. Patient A noted that in the past he had felt spacey from an injection of novocaine.
After the risks were discussed with Patient A, he did agree to the injection.

5. Immediately after the injection of lidocaine and depomedrol in his left shoulder,
Patient A began having difficulty breathing, was coughing and sweating.

6. Dr. Jianu recognized Patient A was experiencing possible anaphylactic shock and
paramedics were immediately called by Dr. Jianu’s office; however Patient A did not receive any
administration of epinephrine or oxygen from Dr. Jianu or his staff although both were available in
Dr. Jianu’s office.

7. Patient A was noted to be code blue at the time the paramedics arrived, however he
was not receiving any respiratory efforts and was not being closely monitored. The paramedics
immediately gave Patient A epinephrine, shocked him three times and had to intubate him. CPR
was performed as Patient A was transported to Saint Rose Dominican Hospital- Siena Campus.

8. At the hospital, Patient A was also noted in the emergency department to be
experiencing a code blue and resuscitation efforts were attempted for twenty minutes including

multiple defibrillations and multiple epinephrine being given; however Patient A could not be

resuscitated.

9. An autopsy was performed which indicated the cause of death was systemic
anaphylaxis.

10. Dr. Jianu did prepare an electronic medical record for Patient A which was started

on August 2, 2007 at the time of Patient A’s appointment, however the record indicates that it was
not electronically signed by Dr. Jianu until June 17, 2010.
