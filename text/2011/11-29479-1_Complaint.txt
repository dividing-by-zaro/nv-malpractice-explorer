COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),
composed at the time of approving filing the complaint of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D.,
Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., and Mr. Van V. Heffner, by and through Edward O. Cousineau,
Deputy Executive Director for the Board and Attorney for the Investigative Committee, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Clayton Fuller, M.D., hereinafter referred to as "Respondent," has
violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the
Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent was actively licensed to practice medicine by the Board on
August 3, 2004, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and at
all times addressed herein was so licensed. Respondent practices medicine in Las Vegas and his
indicated specialties to the Board are family practice and emergency medicine.

2. Patient A was a sixty-two-year-old female at the time of the events at issue. Her
true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A presented to Mesa View Regional Hospital in Mesquite, Nevada on

February 19, 2008 with complaints of right wrist pain after falling. Shortly thereafter, Patient A

was evaluated by Respondent noted in the medical records distal radius tenderness and swelling of
Patient A’s wrist, and “no p[oin]t tenderness.” Of import, Respondent did not have x-rays
accomplished on Patient A’s wrist. While the medical records indicate that x-rays were deferred,
there is no documentation to indicate why x-rays were not accomplished, or the potential
benefits/risks of delaying the same. Patient A was later discharged from the hospital with her wrist
wrapped with an elastic bandage and orders to follow-up with an orthopedist nine to ten days later.

4, It is now alleged by the Investigative Committee that Respondent’s care and
treatment of Patient A constitutes malpractice, as Patient A’s age, mechanism, and the location of
pain with associated swelling, should have caused Respondent to order x-rays of Patient A’s wrist
prior to her being discharged, and that this failure led to a delay in the ultimate diagnosis that
Patient A had suffered a wrist fracture. Moreover, Respondent’s decision to discharge Patient A
with only elastic bandages to the wrist also rose to the level of malpractice, as even in the absence
of diagnostic x-rays, Patient A’s circumstance called for the use of a rigid support splint.

5. Malpractice is defined at NAC 630.040 as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

6. Based upon the foregoing, Respondent has violated NRS 630.301(4), and is subject
to discipline as provided by NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing;

2. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him, the time
and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions against him;

3. That the Board determine what sanctions it determines to impose for the violation
or violations committed by Respondent;

conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed;
5. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these

premises.
