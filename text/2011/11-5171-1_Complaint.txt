COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, comprised
of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Chairman, Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., Member, and Van V.
Heffner, Member, at the time it approved and authorized the filing of this complaint having a
reasonable basis to believe that Paul Cummings Ludlow, M.D., hereinafter referred to as
Respondent, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint,
stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent's license is currently in active status (License No. 3496), and has been
so licensed since March 4, 1978 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a sixty-two year old (62) male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On or about March 8, 2007, Patient A presented to Respondent with a ten (10) to
fifteen (15) year history of a mass in the right parotid gland. The mass was unchanged in size and
occasionally hard. A CT scan showed the mass to involve the superficial and deep lobes with
extension to the stylomastoid foramen and a question of the mass tracking along the facial nerve.

4, Physical examination on March 8, 2007 showed the mass to be 3.5 to 4.0 cm.

5. On March 13, 2007, an ultrasound guided Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy
was performed. The FNA showed nondiagnostic findings. The radiologist recommended possible
CT guidance and a core biopsy.

6. An MRI was performed that showed a large mass in the mid parotid gland
extending to the deep lobe. The MRI report did not mention the facial nerve.

7. Surgery for the removal of the mass was planned. However, there are no office
notes regarding the review of the FNA or the MRI with Patient A, and no discussions with Patient
A regarding the possible etiology of the parotid mass, any further work-up including observation
versus surgery, the detailed nature of the surgery or its risks, complications or possible
alternatives.

8. Surgery was performed on April 16, 2007. A frozen section analysis revealed a
schwannoma. The surgery sacrificed the facial nerve, so Patient A suffered a severed facial nerve.

9. Given the MRI finding, the risks of severing the facial nerve were of paramount
importance and the most feared complication from this type of surgery. The records do not
demonstrate any discussion with Patient A of the potential risks to the facial nerve.

10. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

11. | Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of
a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

12. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

13. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under the same or similar circumstances when he failed and omitted to discuss the review of the
FNA and MRI with Patient A; failed to discuss the possible etiology of the parotid mass, potential
further work-up including observation versus surgery; failed to discuss the detailed nature of the

surgery or its risks, complications or possible alternatives; and, failed to discuss the risks of
severing the facial nerve and/or related complications from this type of surgery with Patient A.

14. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
