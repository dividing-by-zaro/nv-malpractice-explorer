The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed

Ms. Valerie Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Edward Victoria, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Dr. Victoria, has violated the provisions of
NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Dr. Victoria is currently licensed in active status (License No.12452), and was
originally licensed on September 4, 2007 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

Designation served on Dr. Victoria along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A was involved in a motor vehicle accident in November 2007 while in
Seattle, WA and suffered multiple severe injuries. She had an extended hospital course while in

5. Patient A was transferred from St. Rose San Martin to Harmon Medical and
Rehabilitation Hospital on December 12, 2007 for continued tracheostomy care.

6. While at Harmon Medical and Rehabilitation Hospital, Patient A remained on
coumadin for anticoagulation due to a suspected pulmonary embolism. Patient A continued to
improve and was to be discharged home on December 24, 2007. At the time of discharge, Patient
A had an INR level of 2.7.

7. Patient A requested of Dr. Victoria that her PEG tube be removed prior to
discharge. Dr. Victoria did remove the PEG tube at Patient A’s bedside and noted little bleeding.
The tube was removed at approximately 1445 in the afternoon, however there are no further notes
regarding the removal of the PEG tube.

8. At 1530 Patient A’s discharge was halted as she was noted to be anxious,
tachycardiac and hypotensive due to hypovolemic shock. Attempts were made to stabilize her
condition but at 1550 she was transferred to the Emergency Department of Desert Springs
Hospital.

9. An emergency endoscopy was performed and a tear and clot were found at the site
of the PEG tube. Patient A was hospitalized for several days but did eventually recover.

Count I

10. Nevada Administrative Code section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a
physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under
similar circumstances.

11. Nevada Revised Statutes section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating discipline against a licensee.

12. Dr. Victoria committed malpractice as defined by NAC 630.040 when he removed
Patient A’s PEG tube too early and in an improper manner.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Dr. Victoria is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.
