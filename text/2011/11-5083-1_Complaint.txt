served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint. Patient D was a fifty-eight-year-old
male at the time of the events at issue. His true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his
privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this
Complaint. °

3. Previous to the preparation of this Complaint, the Board solicited the services of an
independent medical expert to review the medical records of several patients previously treated by
Respondent. The record review included those of Patients A, B, C and D.

4, The expert’s review of Patient A’s medical records concluded that Respondent’s
prescribing practices for Patient A were excessive and inconsistent with the appropriate standard
of care. Specifically, the expert concluded that Respondent prescribed excessively high doses and
amounts of controlled substances to Patient A without considering alternative means of treating
the patient’s pain or obtaining ancillary diagnostic testing. Further, the medical records for Patient
A were lacking in adequate documentation and did not establish sufficient medical justification for
Respondent’s continued prescribing of controlled substances.

5. The expert’s review of Patient B’s medical records determined that Respondent
prescribed a combination of high-dose controlled substances which put Patient B at extreme risk
of overdose and/or respiratory arrest, which was inconsistent with the appropriate standard of care.
Further, the medical records for Patient B were lacking in adequate documentation and did not
establish sufficient medical justification for Respondent’s continued prescribing of controlled
substances.

6. The expert’s review of Patient C’s medical records determined that Respondent’s
prescribing of controlled substances to Patient C was inconsistent with the appropriate standard of
care, in that Respondent’s medical record keeping lacked documentation to support his medical
decision making, that Respondent failed to consider other drug classes for pain relief as an
alternative to the prescribing of high doses of controlled substances with addictive toxicity, and
that Respondent failed to obtain alternate diagnostic testing to justify his continued prescribing of
controlled substances.

7. The expert’s review of Patient D’s medical records concluded that Respondent’s
prescribing practices for Patient D were inconsistent with the appropriate standard of care and
noted that the medical records for Patient D lacked medical justification for Respondent’s
prescribing of controlled substances. Moreover, the expert believes that there is a causal
connection between Respondent’s prescribing practices for Patient D and his accidental death

from acute polypharmacy intoxication.
