ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION

On August 26, 2011, Board staff presented evidence and information to the Investigative

Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners ("Board"), composed of
Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman, Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and
Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, regarding Larry Yee, M.D. Upon review of the evidence and
information presented by Board staff, the Investigative Committee hereby IMMEDIATELY
SUSPENDS the license to practice medicine of Dr. Larry Yee (hereinafter "Dr. Yee") pursuant to
NRS 630.326(1), based upon the following preliminary findings:

1. Dr. Yee is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada and was
originally licensed on July 10, 1982. Dr. Yee practices medicine in the Las Vegas area and his
primary specialty is listed with the Board as family practice.

2. Pursuant to standard procedure, the Investigative Committee (“Committee”),
through Board staff, requested Dr. Yee, on several occasions to provide responses and records
related to matters before the Committee. These matters include: confirmed instances of
increasingly erratic and inappropriate behavior as witnessed by patients, current and former staff
members of Dr. Yee, as well as Board staff; questionable prescribing practices and the obtaining
and attempting to obtain prescription medications, including controlled substances, for himself
through staff and patients; and his failure to comply with previous orders of the Committee to
address concerns that could affect his ability to provide appropriate and safe patient care.

3. Dr. Yee previously failed to comply with these requests and subsequently an order
to appear before the Committee in August 2010 was served on Dr. Yee. Dr. Yee failed to appear
before the Committee as ordered. Subsequently, a formal complaint (10-6816-1) was filed
charging Dr. Yee with one count of failing to comply with an order of a committee of the Board, a
violation of NRS 630.3065(2)(a). The matter is pending settlement before the Board.

4. Attempts were again made to secure responses and records regarding matters before
the Committee and subpoenas were eventually issued to obtain the requested materials. Dr. Yee
failed to comply with the subpoenas and any attempts of Board staff to obtain the materials
requested.

5. In the interim, it was confirmed that Dr. Yee’s erratic and inappropriate behaviors
have continued to escalate. An order was served on Dr. Yee, through his counsel. on July 27,
2011, ordering his appearance before the Committee to discuss his failure to respond to repeated
attempts of the Committee to secure materials needed to complete an investigation and review of
these serious matters before they could affect patient safety.

6. On August 26, 2011, Dr. Yee failed to appear before the Committee as ordered to
discuss the matters being considered by the Committee.

As a result of the foregoing, the Investigative Committee believes that due to Dr. Yee’s
confirmed continuing erratic and inappropriate behavior, his prescribing practices and attempts to
obtain prescription drugs, including controlled substances, through others, his failure to comply
with previously issued Committee orders and his continual failure to comply with requests or
orders of the Committee to address these serious matters, that the health, safety and welfare of the
public is at imminent risk of harm and that a summary suspension of Dr. Yee’s license to practice
medicine is necessary to remove said risk of imminent harm to the health, safety and welfare of the
public.

Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
of Larry Yee, M.D. (License No. 4655) is hereby suspended until further order of the Investigative

Cominittee or Board; and,

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing be set within forty-five (45) days of this
Order regarding this matter, pursuant to NRS 630.326(2), to determine whether this suspension
may continue, unless the parties mutually agree to a longer period of time. |
