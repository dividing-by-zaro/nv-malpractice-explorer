5. Patient A was seen by Dr. Mathis at 1910. A physical examination was performed
and x-rays of the clavicle and ribs were taken. During the physical examination Patient A reported
no complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or shortness of breath.

6. Radiology readings reported that Patient A as having a fracture of the left clavicle
and fractures of the left second through seventh ribs. The radiology report also noted a suggestion
of an upper left lobe pulmonary contusion and could not exclude a small effusion.

7. No further imaging was completed nor was any lab work ordered. Patient A was
not examined again and was discharged with stable vital signs at 1940 with a prescription for pain
medications and instructions to follow up with his physician within four days.

8. Patient A was found unconscious in his home on November 26, 2006 and was
unable to be resuscitated by emergency personnel.

9. An autopsy was performed which indicated the cause of death as splenic lacerations
with hemoperitoneum due to blunt force of torso. Contributing factors were noted as severe
obesity and therapeutic use of warfarin.
