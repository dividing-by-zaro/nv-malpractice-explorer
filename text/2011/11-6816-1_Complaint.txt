MEDICAL EXAMINERS

COMPLAINT
The Investigative Committee ("IC") of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners,

composed at the time filing of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D. having a reasonable
basis to believe that Larry Yee, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the
provisions of NRS Chapter 630, and hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative
Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently in suspended status (License No. 4655), by the Nevada
State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada
Revised Statutes.

2. An order of the IC was served upon Respondent, through his counsel, on
July 27, 2011 ordering his appearance before it to discuss his repeated failures to respond to
repeated attempts to secure materials needed to complete an investigation and review of the
matters before it.

3. On August 26, 2011, Respondent failed to appear before the IC as ordered.

4, A previous order of the IC was served upon Respondent on May 27, 2010 ordering
a second psychiatric evaluation, assessment and/or examination of his overall competency to
practice medicine in conjunction with a previous compliance agreement from June, 2008.

5. Under the June, 2008 compliance agreement, the IC was to receive psychiatric
reports every three (3) months on Respondent's progress and medical practice for an entire year.
After one (1) year, reporting was to continue every six (6) months for the remainder of
Respondent's life. These reports have stopped, and the IC does not know the reasons why. The
IC's lack of knowledge and information is due mainly to Respondent's repeated failures to appear
before the IC and cooperate with it. Further, Respondent didn't return for his second appointment
with the psychiatrist in June, 2010.

6. This is, importantly, the continuation of a pattern of willful failures by Respondent
to appear and cooperate with the IC. His failure to appear and cooperation has, and continues to,
interfere with the IC's duty: to investigate pending complaints received about Respondent and
protect the public. His pattern of willful failure to appear before, and cooperate with, the IC is
now ongoing for over two (2) years.

7. Respondent on several occasions has admitted to refilling and taking patient
prescriptions for his own personal use. He also has admitted to asking patient(s) to fill
prescriptions for his own personal use.

8. Respondent has also falsely asserted on numerous occasions, including but not
limited to while being interviewed on the Las Vegas morning talk show "The Morning Blend",
that he is Board certified with the American Board of Family Medicine when he is not. He has not
been Board certified with them since 1999.

Count I

9. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference as
though fully set forth herein.

10. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(9) provides that the engaging in conduct
that brings the medical profession into disrepute is grounds for initiating discipline against a
licensee.

11. Respondent's continued pattern of failing to appear and cooperate with the IC;
failing to maintain compliance with the 2008 agreement with the IC; asking patients to fill

prescriptions for his personal use and taking patients prescriptions for personal use; and,

communicating that he is Board certified in family medicine when he is not, all constitute conduct

for his personal use constitute conduct which was intended to deceive.

Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the
Nevada Revised Statutes.

Count II

17. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set

willful failures to comply with an Order of a committee designated by the Board.

20. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
