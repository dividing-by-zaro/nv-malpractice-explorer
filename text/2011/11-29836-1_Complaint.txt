COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing was approved of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Beverly Neyland, M.D. and
Ms. Donna Ruthe, having a reasonable basis to believe that Nauman Jahangir, M.D. hereinafter
referred to as Dr. Jahangir, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its
formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Dr. Jahangir is licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada (License No.
11295), and was originally licensed on January 11, 2005 by the Nevada State Board of Medical
Examiners pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a sixty-seven-year-old female at the time of the incident in question.
Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A presented to Dr. Jahangir in early February 2007 for management of her
varicose veins. Patient A had undergone vein stripping in the past and did not wish surgical
intervention but rather opted to undergo injection of sclerosant for treatment of her varicose veins.

4, On February 13, 2007, Dr. Jahangir performed bilateral injection of sclerosant on
Patient A at Sunrise Hospital under local anesthesia. According to the procedure note, the sites of!

varicosities had been marked and after infiltration of a quarter percent bupivacaine with

epinephrine, 98% alcohol was injected at all sites around the veins, but not any direct intravenous
administration of the veins occurred.

5. At Patient A’s post-procedure visit to Dr. Jahangir, she was noted to have necrotic
skin over the injection sites and pain at her right ankle. She was provided with oral antibiotics as
well as antibiotic ointment.

6. Patient A continued to have some wound problems requiring follow-up treatment
by Sunrise Comprehensive Wound Care.

Count I

7. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

8. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds for initiating discipline
against a licensee.

9. Dr. Jahangir committed malpractice as defined by NAC 630.040 when he used
98% alcohol as the sclerosing agent and injected in the tissue surrounding Patient A’s varicose
veins rather than injecting the veins and accordingly is in violation of NRS 630.301(4).

10. By reason of the foregoing, Dr. Jahangir is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NAC 630.555.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Jahangir notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service
of the Complaint.

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a
formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
determines to impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical
Practice Act (Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 630) committed by Dr. Jahangir; and

4. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
