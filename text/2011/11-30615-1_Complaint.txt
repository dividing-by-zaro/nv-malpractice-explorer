COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, comprised
of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and Valerie J. Clark,
Member, at the time it approved and authorized the filing of this complaint having a reasonable
basis to believe that Jocelyn Quebral Ivie, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has
violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the
Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent's license is currently in active status (License No. 11553), and has been
so licensed since August 1, 2005 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a thirty year old (30) female at the time of the incidents in question.
Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On or about April 11, 2005, Patient A when 39 weeks pregnant presented to
Respondent's office for a non-stress test on April 11, 2005. Patient A demonstrated a fetal heart
rate between 160 and 175 bpm with two decelerations down to 130 to 150 bpm for ninety (90) to
one hundred ten seconds (110) and two uterine contractions. As a result, Patient A was admitted

to the hospital at around 1830 hours that evening.

4. At 1900 hours, the fetal heart rate decelerated to as low as 60 bpm lasting at least
one minute. For seventeen (17) straight hours, the fetal heart rate remained tachycardic with little
or no variability. Periodic variable decelerations also occurred that should have alerted the
physician(s) and/or staff to problems with the fetus.

5. At this point, an examination should have been performed with an artificial rupture
of membranes to induce labor. This would have demonstrated whether the baby would tolerate
labor. If not, a cesarean delivery ("C-section") should have been performed.

6. As the patient continued to be monitored, there never was a reassuring fetal heart
rate. It included a flat tachycardic fetal heart beat with poor to no variability and intermittent
decelerations.

7. At 0730 hours on April 12, 2005, Dr. Ivie took over care of Patient A at the
hospital. She performed an examination and reviewed the fetal heart rate tracing.

8. The baby showed a thick meconium and an abnormal presentation of face mentum
anterior. This abnormal presentation makes delivery very difficult. Respondent should have taken
immediate action to deliver the baby by C-section.

9. Instead, Respondent continued to observe Patient A's labor that showed a continued
deteriorating fetal condition. Significant deep variable decelerations with contractions and a flat
fetal heart rate persisted from 1040 hours to 1140 hours on April 12, 2005.

10. A little later at 1200 hours, Patient A had minimal cervical change, and the baby
still exhibited a face presentation. Despite this, Respondent began Pitocin to make labor stronger.
This was contraindicated in the presence of the acute fetal distress.

11. That same day at 1600 hours, Respondent performed another examination on
Patient A. The cervix was dilated to 5 c.m., and the abnormal face presentation remained. At this
time, Respondent finally scheduled the C-section.

12. Unfortunately, the baby's heart finally gave up at this late hour. After twenty-one
(21) hours of observed non-reassuring fetal heart tracing, the baby's heart stopped. An emergency
C-section was carried out, and neonatal death resulted.

a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

15. | Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

12, 2005 at 0730 hours after the examination and review of the heart tracing; ordered Pitocin for
Patient A when it was contraindicated in the presence of this acute fetal distress.

17. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

Respondent its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the
