COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing was approved of, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Ms. Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU,
LUTCF, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., having a reasonable basis to believe that
Sami Salih Zamzam, M.D. hereinafter referred to as Dr. Zamzam, has violated the provisions of
NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Dr. Zamzam is licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
(License No. 10242), and was originally licensed on July 5, 2002, by the Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS).

2. Dr. Zamzam specialty of practice is listed as anesthesiology and practiced in the
Reno/Sparks area until early 2011 when Dr. Zamzam relocated out of state.

3. While in Nevada, Dr. Zamzam also worked as the on-site medical director of
Radiance Medical Spa in Reno, Nevada, which included allowing the non-physician owners and
staff of Radiance Medical Spa to obtain dangerous drugs for administration at Radiance Medical
Spa using his physician information.

4, When Dr. Zamzam relocated out-of-state, he did not sever his relationship with
Radiance Medical Spa, and continued on as medical director/consultant to the Medical Spa as he
was available by telephone. There was no other licensed physician, physician assistant or
advanced practitioner of nursing on site after Dr. Zamzam’s departure, however a registered nurse
who had worked at Radiance Medical Spa prior to his departure remained.

5. Dr. Zamzam consulted with and approved of a protocol for Human Chorionic
Gonadotropin (HCG) injections for weight loss which included allowing a registered nurse to
perform patient consultations for the use of HCG injections and to agree to said injections for
patients. HCG is a compounded drug which is a controlled substance.

6. Dr. Zamzam allowed his DEA license number and medical license to be used to
procure controlled substances and dangerous drugs while acting as the “on-site medical director”
and took no actions to ensure that this practice did not continue after leaving the state.

7. Utilizing Dr. Zamzam’s information, unlicensed individuals at Radiance Medical
Spa procured as well as dispensed and administered both dangerous drugs and controlled
substances to patients of Radiance Medical Spa while he was out of the state.

Count I

8. NRS 630.305(1)(e) provides that aiding, assisting, employing or advising, directly
or indirectly, any unlicensed person to engage in the practice of medicine is grounds for the
initiation of discipline.

9. Dr. Zamzam advised unlicensed individuals, directly or indirectly, to engage in the
practice of medicine when he continued acting as a medical director/consultant after leaving the
state, approving a protocol for HCG injections which did not require a patient to be seen by an
individual licensed to practice medicine and when he took no action to ensure his DEA license and
medical license were not utilized to procure any dangerous drugs or controlled substances.

10. Accordingly Dr. Zamzam is in violation of NRS 630.305(1)(e) and is subject to
discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.
