Ce
COMPLAINT .

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),

composed of Charles N. Held, M.D., Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, and
Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., at the time of the authorization of filing this formal complaint, by and
through Edward O. Cousineau, Deputy Executive Director for the Board, and counsel for the
Investigative Committee, having a reasonable basis to believe that Henry Landsman, M.D.,
hereinafter referred to as "Respondent," has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby
issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as
follows:

1. Respondent was originally issued a license to practice medicine in the state of
Nevada on March 29, 1980. Respondent’s licensure status is currently active, and at all times
alleged herein, Respondent was licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630
of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a seventy-six-year-old male at the time of the events at issue. His
true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A presented to Desert View Regional Medical Center, located in Pahrump,

Nevada, at approximately 0015 on July 12, 2006 with complaints of mid-sternal chest pain.

Medical records indicate that Respondent undertook the initial evaluation of Patient A.
Respondent ordered various laboratory tests, an echocardiogram, a chest X-ray, and the
administration of aspirin and nitroglycerin. The initial echocardiogram was non-specific for a
myocardial infarction; however, the laboratory tests showed elevated troponin levels.

4. Patient A was discharged less than fours hours after he first presented with a
discharge diagnosis of “chest pain” and he was directed to follow up with a cardiologist within a
week. At approximately 1630 on July 12, 2006, Patient A again presented to Desert View
Regional Medical Center in cardiac distress. Patient A was transferred via helicopter to Valley
Hospital in Las Vegas soon thereafter for emergent cardiac intervention.

5. It is now alleged by the Investigative Committee that Respondent’s care and
treatment of Patient A constitutes malpractice, as Patient A’s age, complaints of chest pain for
six-plus hours pervious to his admission, and elevated troponin level should have caused
Respondent to continue with further evaluation and testing prior to finalizing disposition, or in
the alternative, transferred Patient A to a medical facility with invasive cardiac intervention
capability.

6. Malpractice is defined at NAC 630.040 as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

7. Based upon the foregoing, Respondent has violated NRS 630.301(4), and is subject
to discipline as provided by NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing;

2. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him, the time
and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions against him;

3. That the Board determine what sanctions it determines to impose for the violation
or violations committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of facts,

conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed;

these premises.
