FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC)! of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Aaron Bart Fricke, Esq., Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for
the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Asher Shahzad, M.D. (Respondent), violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and the Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its First Amended Complaint
(Complaint), stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a licensed medical doctor
holding an active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 13790).
Respondent was originally licensed by the Board on January 5, 2011.

2. Patient A was a 25-year-old female at the time of the incidents in question. Her
name is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A gave birth to premature twins on or about May 11, 2013.

4. Following discharge from the hospital, on or about May 18, 2013, Patient A
presented to the emergency department with a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit.


'The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Chairman, Aury Nagy,
M.D., and Michael C. Edwards, M.D., FACS.

5. On May 23, 2013, Patient A presented with fever, was seen by a doctor other than
Respondent, and was referred to another doctor for evaluation of possible mastitis. The physician
to whom she was referred evaluated her for mastitis on or about May 29, 2013, and referred her to
Respondent’s practice partner at Clinical Infectious Disease Specialists, Dr. Shah, for an
infectious disease evaluation.

6. From May 31, 2013 through June 12, 2013, Dr. Shah treated Patient A with various
antibiotics, including intravenous antibiotic treatment, for an abdominal wound infection and
recurring fever after the infection had resolved.

7. On June 20, 2013, Patient A was admitted to the hospital with complaints of fever,
weakness, dizziness and confusion. She was seen by Respondent. Upon information and belief,
Respondent discussed with Patient A and her husband whether she had been screened for
tuberculosis; however, Respondent’s medical records do not reflect any such conversation.

8. On June 30, 2013, Patient A was transferred to UCLA Medical Center.

9. On July 1, 2013, Patient A died. An autopsy confirmed that Patient A had
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which was the cause of her death.

COUNT I
NRS 630.3062(1)(a)
(Failure to Maintain Timely, Legible, Accurate and Complete Medical Records)

10. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

11. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds
for initiating discipline against a licensee.

12. Respondent failed to maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete medical
records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A, in that he failed to document
discussions he had with Patient A and/or her husband on or about June 20, 2013 regarding
tuberculosis risk factors, and whether Patient A had previously been screened for tuberculosis.
