The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

reasonable basis to believe that Syed F. Rahman, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of

(collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and
allegations as follows:

lL. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10030). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on November 17, 2001.

2. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

Respondent was the attending physician for Patient A, who was receiving all nourishment and
non-intravenous medication through a gastric feeding tube (PEG tube), which was administered at
Sunrise.

4. On July 5, 2015, Patient A’s PEG tube was displaced, and an attempt was made to
replace the PEG tube with a Foley catheter placed into the site from which this PEG tube had been
displaced. Tube feedings were discontinued, as Respondent ordered a Total Parental Nutrition (TPN),
and a gastroenterology (GI) consult. Patient A’s blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 24 and keratinize
(Cr) was 0.94, reflective of an adequate hydration level, and of proper renal function.

5. On July 9, 2015, the GI consultant ordered to continue to hold all tube feedings, and
continue with the previously ordered TPN.

6. On July 10, 2015, the BUN was 39, and the Cr was 0.89, indicating less hydration.

7. On July 12, 2015, the BUN was 45, and the Cr was 0.87, indicating inadequate
hydration.

8. On July 14, 2015, the BUN was 53, and the Cr was 1.03, indicating worsening
hydration and possible renal degradation in function.

9, On July 16, 2015, the BUN was 66, and the Cr was 1.21.

10. On July 17, 2015, the BUN was 86, and the Cr was 1.57, indicating worsening renal
function or failure due to the rising BUN/Cr ratio of greater than 50. TPN was the sole source of
nutrition and hydration for Patient A.

11. On July 18, 2015, Patient A was transterred back to Sunrise. Patient A’s BUN was
105 and the Cr was 2.19. Under Respondent’s care, Patient A’s renal function worsened, suffered
from malnutrition and dehydration.

14. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

15. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he provided medical services to Patient A based upon his inadequate management and resolution
of the PEG tube, his inadequate management of worsening renal failure as indicated by the rising
BUN/Cr Ratio.

16. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.3062(1)(a)
(Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records)

17. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

18. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

19. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to document his actions when he treated Patient A,
whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

20. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

22. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for imitating
disciplinary action against a licensee pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

23. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.

24. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition of dehydration and of renal failure, and Respondent should have consulted with an
appropriate care provider to address the aforementioned worsening conditions, and such a
consultation could have enhanced Patient A’s declining medical condition of renal failure and
dehydration.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

l. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;
