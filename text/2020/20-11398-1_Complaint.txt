COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Robert Kilroy, Esq., General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that William Douglas Smith, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges
and allegations as follows:

L. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 7897). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 17, 1996.

2. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On July 22, 2012, Patient A was initially seen by Respondent, who noted her
symptoms had worsened, with hyperreflexia findings in her lower extremities, and beats of clonus in
the left calf. Respondent recommended a T2-T3 costotransversectomy with a complete discetomy,
and interbody fusion with decompression of the thecal sac. On August 9, 2012, during a follow-up

visitation, Respondent recommended a C5-C6 foraminotomy procedure in addition to the T2-T3

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), at the time this
formal Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chairman,
Ms. April Mastroluca, and Aury Nagy, M.D.

costotransversectomy procedure. Both procedures were planned for August 15, 2012. On August 15,
2012, according to the operative report, Respondent made an incision, “on the right side” down at
Patient A’s T2-T3, and the disk (at T2-T3) was removed, and a partial removal of the vertebral body at
T2 was completed. On October 4, 2012, Patient A’s myelopahty improved.

4. On February 25, 2014, Patient A complained to Respondent of increasing pain, and
there was found an image of a large hyperreflexia lesion at the T2-T3 region. Respondent suggested
that this image at the T2-T3 region was an osteoma, and recommended a left compression and partial
vertebrectomy, as the osteoma showed an anterior cord compression on the upper thoracic cord of
Patient A’s back. On April 23, 2014, Respondent performed a revision of the cervical foraminotomy
at the C5-C6 location, and another partial vertebrectomy at T2 and T3, with a complete facetectomy
and excision of the rib head on the right. Following these two procedures by Respondent, Patient A
complained in the recovery room to the nurses that she was having difficulty moving her extremities.
Respondent reviewed an emergent MRI of Patient A, and he felt that Patient A had an anterior spinal

artery infarct which (he believed) could not be rectified surgically, but had caused Patient A’s acute

paraplegia.

COUNT Ul
NRS 630.3062(1)(a)
(Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records)

10. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

Ll. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

12. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to document his actions when he treated Patient A,
whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT HI

NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2)
(Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation)

14. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

15. Violation of a standard of practice established by regulation of the Board is
grounds for imitating disciplinary action against a licensee pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

16. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.

17. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition of her having difficulty moving her lower extremities, and Respondent should have
consulted with an appropriate care provider to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of this
condition, and such a consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis.
