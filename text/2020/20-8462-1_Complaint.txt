94. _ All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

95. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

96. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient H, by failing to document his actions in complying with the Model
Policy, including, but not limited to, failing to document the following: physical examinations
before prescribing opioid analgesics; queries of the PMP before prescribing opioid analgesics;
urinalysis before and after prescribing opioid analgesics; support for his diagnoses with physical
examination findings; treatment objectives to evaluate treatment progress; monitoring and
adapting his treatment plan; progress toward discontinuation of opioid therapy.

97. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

I. Respondent’s Investigative Committee Order to Appear.

98. On June 15, 2020, Respondent was sent an Order to Appear (Order) by certified
mail to his registered address on file with the Board. Due to Covid-19 protocols, Respondent’s
appearance was changed to a telephonic appearance. On July 15, 2020, Respondent was sent an
email to his email address on file with the Board and the IC requested a good telephone number so
that he could be called when his appearance time occurred. On July 17, 2020, a letter was sent to
Respondent’s office containing the same message as the July 15, 2020 email. On July 27, 2020,
the assigned investigator called, and communicated with Respondent’s office manager (spouse)
and she stated that Respondent had received the Order and the July 17, 2020, letter. This office
manager provided the IC’s requested Respondent’s phone number. Again, this investigator
communicated the IC’s Order that Respondent appear via telephonic means. Respondent failed to

answer his number at the appointment time, as stated in the Order, after being informed of the

time, date and manner of this appearance Order. Multiple attempts to communicate with
Respondent were conducted, but he refused to answer the IC’s call to him for his appearance.
Several calls were placed to the office manager of the Respondent, but she failed to answer the
IC’s call for Respondent’s appearance after she had been informed and acknowledged the time,
date and manner of this appearance Order. Respondent never appeared or called back despite
several voice mails being left.

COUNT XVII

NRS 630.3065(2)(a) (Failure to Comply with Investigative Committee Order to Appear)

99. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

100. Pursuant to NRS 630.3065(2)(a), the following act of knowingly or willfully failing
to comply with an Investigative Committee Order to appear is grounds for initiating a disciplinary
action against a licensee of this Board.

provided in NRS 630.352.
