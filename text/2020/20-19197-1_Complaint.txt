MD, United States District Court, District of Nevada, Case No.

:13-cr-0041-APG-CWH, the
Court entered its Judgment in a Criminal Case, adjudging Bruce guilty of violating 21 USC §§

(46) months of imprisonment, among other sanctions.

5. On December 31, 2014, the Board revoked Bruce’s previous license to practice
medicine (License No. 8652) pursuant to a Settlement Agreement and Order entered by the Board

application for licensure and preceptor plan. After an appearance by Bruce and Respondent before

Brice an “Active-Restricted” license to practice medicine for the express purpose of permitting
him to participate in a preceptorship with Respondent, whereby Respondent was to supervise the
medical activities of Bruce and report to the Board regarding Bruce’s competence to practice
medicine. The Board ordered Bruce to complete a one-year preceptorship with Respondent, and
explicitly restricted Bruce from prescribing controlled substances for a minimum of twenty-four
(24) months or until his probation period lapses, whichever is greater, and subject to prior
approval of the Board.

7. Respondent, at all times relative to this Complaint, was the proprietor of “Bernard
Addo-Quaye, MD PC,” dba “TruCare Medical Center” (“TruCare”). TruCare is located at 2290
