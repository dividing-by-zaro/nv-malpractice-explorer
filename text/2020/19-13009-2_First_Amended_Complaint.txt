FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(“Board”) hereby issues this formal Complaint against Jon L. Siems, M.D. (hereinafter referred to
as Respondent), a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the
Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is currently, and was at all times relevant to this Complaint, licensed in
active status (License No. 9250). Respondent was issued his license from the Board on December
20, 1999, pursuant to the provisions of NRS Chapter 630.

Patient A

2. Patient A was between the ages of forty-six (46) years old and fifty-four (54) years
old during the time of the events at issue. Her true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her
privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of
this Complaint.

3. Patient A initially saw Respondent on or about July 26, 2007, for a Lasik

evaluation. .

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, and Aury Nagy, M.D..

4. Respondent diagnosed Patient A with keratoconus based on orbscans performed by
Respondent.

5. Respondent implanted Intacs for Patient A soon thereafter reportedly to stabilize
her corneas.

6. Patient A reported to Respondent’s office on or about August 24, 2007 for her
surgery to implant the Intacs and signed an informed consent.

7. The informed consent made no mention of corneal instability but referred to
implantation of Intacs to correct nearsightedness.

8. Over the next six years, approximately, Patient A visited Respondent and his
associates 27 times, during which she complained of poor vision and recurrent episodes of corneal
inflammation, requiring treatment with ocular lubricants, topical steroids, and both corrective and
bandage contact lenses.

9. On or about June, 21, 2012, Respondent diagnosed Patient A with peripheral
corneal vascularization and protein deposits around the Intacs.

10. Patient A’s last visit to Respondent was October 12, 2013, with best corrected
vision of 20/50 with doubling of myopia to -6.00 diopters in both eyes.

11. Patient A continued to have discomfort and vision problems following her final
visit to Respondent.

12. Patient A sought relief through other eye care professionals for a period of
approximately two more years.

13. One of those doctors removed the Intacs from Patient A’s left eye on June 11,
2015, and from her right eye on August 1, 2015, at which time her vision improved and the
corneal vascularization began to dissipate.

14. The medical records Respondent provided fail to document clearly defined
indications and documentation for the diagnosis and treatment of keratoconus.
