mother of a minor female patient (AC) regarding a dermatologic examination performed by
Respondent in which she complained that Respondent’s actions and statements made her daughter
uncomfortable.


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Chairman,
