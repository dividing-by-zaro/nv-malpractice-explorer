FILED

GARY C. RIDENOUR, M.LD., MAY 26 2020
NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

Respondent. MPBICAL EXAMINERS

Against

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Robert Kilroy, Esq., General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Gary C. Ridenour, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and
allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 4525). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on April 3, 1982. Respondent placed his license in an “inactive”
status on October 24, 2019.

2. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3, On October 31, 2016, Patient A was seen at the Spine Nevada Institute (SNI), with
a diagnosis of chronic neck and back pain with a possible reticular etiology. No opioid treatment
for Patient A was indicated within Patient A’s medical records.

4, On January 25, 2017, Patient A saw Respondent to establish care at the High

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal Complaint
was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Dr. Rachakonda D.Prabhu, M.D., Chairman, Dr. Victor
M. Muro, M.D., and Ms. April Mastroluca.

Desert Clinic (Clinic). Respondent reviewed the SNI evaluation of Patient A. Respondent’s
medical records indicated Patient A slipped on ice and had an ankle sprain; however, these
medical notes do not indicate or explain why Respondent treated Patient A in the way that he did,
and the Nevada Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) report shows that another provider (not
Respondent) prescribed and filled a 27 MME (morphine milligram equivalents) dosage of codeine
(an opioid). Further, Respondent’s medical records do not document consideration of non-opioid
therapy, a discussion of risks and benefits, and a review of the PMP data for Patient A. Lastly,
there is no medical justification indicated for Patient A’s opioid treatment.

5. On February 7, 2017, Patient A filled a prescription for 30 tablets of temazepam
written by another car provider as indicated in the PMP for Patient A.

6. On February 9, 2017, Patient A saw Respondent for foot & ankle pain, headaches
and back pain. Here, within a handwritten note, Respondent advised a consult with SNI, not to
exceed the prescribed doses of medication and that Norco would be prescribed due to recent leg
pain. The PMP report for this date indicated Patient A obtained a prescription and filled 15 MME
of hydrocodone-acetaminophen by another care provider. Respondent’s notes state “PMP clean,”
but such an entry demonstrates that Respondent failed to see that an opioid drug was prescribed
with a benzodiazepine drug (temazepam) from the PMP report for February 7, 2017.

7. On February 23, 2017, Patient A was seen by an unidentifiable care provider at the
Clinic. The Respondent’s name was at the top of the medical record encounter and it is unsigned.
‘The PMP report indicates Patient A obtained 78 MME of oxycodone and codeine. Such an

amount of MME is a substantial increase of dosage from the previous encounter (2/9/2017) by

two other providers from the Clinic. The medical record does not document any consideration of
the use of non-opioid therapy, a discussion of risks and benefits, or a review of the PMP data.
There is no evidence of medical decision-making to justify the dose escalation to using potentially
excessively high doses of opioid therapy.

8. On March 21-23, 2017, the PMP report indicates that Patient A obtained
prescriptions from two other providers under the employ of the Respondent, Dr. Bargen, and Mr.

Braddix, Advance Practice Registered Nurse (APRN), from the Clinic, and the medical records do

not have any consideration of the use of non-opioid therapy, a discussion of risks and benefits, or
a review of the PMP data. There is no evidence of medical decision-making to justify the dose
escalation to using potentially excessively high dosages of opioid therapy.

9. On April 20, 2017, Patient A was seen by an unknown provider at the Clinic; the
medical records indicate Patient A was in the ER (emergency room) for pancreatitis and was also
seeing a GI specialist. There is no provider name or signature on that record. The PMP report
indicates that Patient A obtained and filled 90 MME of oxycodone and codeine. This 90 MME

daily dosage of an opioid is another substantial increase in the opioid therapy treatment plan.

The medical records do not have any consideration of the use of non-opioid therapy, a discussion
of risks and benefits, or a review of the PMP data. There is no evidence of medical decision-
making to justify the dose escalation to using potentially excessively high dosages of opioid
therapy.

10. On May 18, 2017, Patient A was seen by an unknown provider at the Clinic and
was treated with an injection into the right lower back. The PMP for this date indicates Patient A
obtained and filled a 108 MME of oxycodone and codeine, and another 30-day supply of
temazepam from another provider from the Clinic. This 108 MME daily dosage of an opioid is

another substantial increase in the opioid therapy treatment plan. The medical records do not

have any consideration of the use of non-opioid therapy, a discussion of risks and benefits, or a
review of the PMP data. There is no evidence of medical decision-making to justify the dose
escalation to using potentially excessively high dosages of opioid therapy.

11. On May 23, 2017, Patient A was seen by an unknown provider at the Clinic and
was given an injection of kenalog to the left lower back.

12. On June 20, 2017, Patient A was seen by an unknown provider at the Clinic. The
medical record indicates that she was recently in the ER (Emergency Room) for possible
pancreatitis. There is no provider name or signature on the medical record.

13. On June 28, 2017, Patient A was seen by an unknown provider at the Clinic. This
date is unclear as the medical record appears to have a “28” scribbled over to read “20""” does not

show the provider’s name, and the signature is illegible, but was signed “6-28-17.” The PMP

report indicates Patient A received a 120 MME prescribtion of oxycodone written by Mr. Braddix.

This 120 MME daily dosage of an opioid is another substantial increase in the opioid therapy

treatment plan. The medical records do not have any consideration of the use of non-opioid
therapy, a discussion of risks and benefits, or a review of the PMP data. There is no evidence of
medical decision-making to justify the dose escalation to using potentially excessively high
dosages of opioid therapy.

14. On July 19, 2017, Patient A was seen by an unknown provider at the Clinic. The
medical records do not indicate the provider’s name and the signature is illegible. This medical
record contains discussion about using a short-acting oxycodone in an attempt to discontinue
another form of the same opioid.

15. OnJuly 19, 2017 through July 24, 2017, the PMP indicates that Patient A received
a 250 MME prescription of oxycodone written by Mr. Braddix. Additionally, Patient A received
prescriptions for zolpidem (10 tablets, #30) and received another refill of 18 MME of codeine

from Dr. Bargen. This 250 MME daily dosage of an opioid is another substantial increase in the

opioid therapy treatment plan. The medical records do not have any consideration of the use of
non-opioid therapy, a discussion of risks and benefits, or a review of the PMP data. There is no
evidence of medical decision-making to justify the dose escalation to using potentially excessively
high dosages of opioid therapy.

16. On August 16, 2017, Patient A was seen by an unknown provider at the Clinic.
The medical records do not indicate the provider’s name and the signature is illegible. The PMP
report indicates Patient A received a 280 MME prescription for oxycodone written by Mr.
Braddix, plus a prescription for zolpidem 10 tablets, #30. This 280 MME daily dosage of an

opioid is another substantial increase in the opioid therapy treatment plan. The medical records

do not have any consideration of the use of non-opioid therapy, a discussion of risks and benefits,
or a review of the PMP data. There is no evidence of medical decision-making to justify the dose
escalation to using potentially excessively high dosages of opioid therapy.

17. On September 13, 2017, Patient A Patient A was seen by an unknown provider at

the Clinic. The medical records do not indicate the provider’s name and the signature is illegible.

The PMP report indicates Patient A received a 280 MME prescription of oxycodone written by
Mr. Braddix, plus a prescription for zolpidem 10 tablets, #30. This 230 MME daily dosage of an

opioid is another substantial increase in the opioid therapy treatment plan. The medical records

do not have any consideration of the use of non-opioid therapy, a discussion of risks and benefits,
or a review of the PMP data. There is no evidence of medical decision-making to justify the dose
escalation to using potentially excessively high dosages of opioid therapy.

18. On September 27, 2017, Patient A was seen by an unknown provider at the Clinic.
The medical records do not indicate the provider’s name and the signature is illegible. The PMP
report indicates on September 28, 2017, Patient A filled a 360 MME prescription for oxycodone

written by Mr. Braddix. This 360 MME daily dosage of an opioid is another substantial increase

in the opioid therapy treatment plan. The medical records do not have any consideration of the use
of non-opioid therapy, a discussion of risks and benefits, or a review of the PMP data. There is no
evidence of medical decision-making to justify the dose escalation to using potentially excessively
high dosages of opioid therapy.

19, On October 11, 2017, Patient A was seen by an unknown provider at the Clinic.

plus a prescription for zolpidem 10 tablets, #30, plus 18 MME of codeine prescribed by Dr.
Bargen on August 16, 2017. This 270 MME daily dosage of an opioid is a substantial decrease in

the opioid therapy treatment plan. The medical records do not have any consideration of the use of
non-opioid therapy, a discussion of risks and benefits, or a review of the PMP data. There is no
evidence of medical decision-making to justify the dose de-escalation to using potentially
inadequate dosages of opioid therapy.

20. On October 24, 2017, the PMP report indicates that Patient A filled a 180 MME
prescribtion of oxycodone, written by Mr. Braddix on this same date. There is no medical record

opioid therapy, a discussion of risks and benefits, or a review of the PMP data. There is no
evidence of medical decision-making to justify the dose escalation to using potentially excessively
high dosages of opioid therapy.

25. On December 11, 2017, Patient A died. The Churchill County Sheriff/Coroner
certificate states that “based upon the considerations of the circumstances surrounding death,
review of available medical history/records, autopsy examination, toxicological analysis, and
other ancillary testing, the death of [Patient A] is ascribed to multiple drug toxicity (venlafaxine,
amitriptyline, oxycodone and zolpidem). Based upon the circumstances of death as currently
known, there is insufficient evidence to suggest suicidal intent; hence, the manner of death is best
classified as accident.” The Churchill County Sheriff's Office Report (Form 42) Supplement
indicates that there were three bottles of controlled substances (baclofen, oxyocodone, nexium)
prescribed by Respondent found at Patient A’ s residence and such inspection of the found

containers indicated the following:
