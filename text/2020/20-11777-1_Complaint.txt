At 7:48 a.m., Patient A delivered via a Caesarian section with the baby’s APGARs at zero
(0) at minute one, one (1) at five minutes, one (1) at ten minutes and three (3) at 15 minutes.
Infant was delivered approximately one (1) hour and six (6) minutes after the bradycarida
developed, and suffered from hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

At the time of the aforementioned FHR abnormalities, Patient A was already fully dilated,
and, yet Respondent did not attempt any vaginal/C-section delivery until these FHR abnormalities
lasted more than one hour. Respondent spent too much time on intrauterine resuscitative
measures when an extrauterine resuscitation could have been more expedient and perhaps more
effective. According to the medical records, there was about 20 minutes of bradycarida and
Patient A’s baby suffered from hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
