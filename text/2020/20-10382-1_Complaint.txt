Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

I. Respondent is currently, and was at all times relevant to this Complaint, licensed in

identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy but is disclosed in the Patient Designation
served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A presented for an initial mammogram on or about June 5, 2013, which

showed a new abnormality mass.

| The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), at the time the filing of

4, On or about July 12, 2013, Respondent first saw Patient A, who was diagnosed
with invasive ductal carcinoma, Grade 1.

5. On or about July 26, 2013, Respondent performed what he called a modified
radical mastectomy with lymph node sampling.

6. Pathology returned showing no tumor present, no biopsy site, and no clips in the
specimen. One of two lymph nodes were positive with a micro metastasis.

7. There is no documentation indicating that Respondent discussed with Patient A
either the pathology report or that no residual tumor was identified in the specimen.

8. On or about July 28, 2014, Patient A underwent a mammogram, which showed a
residual mass with two biopsy clips present with ultrasound showing a mass.

9. Patient A was then referred to another surgeon who completed the mastectomy and
performed a node dissection.

10. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference
as though fully set forth herein.

11. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

12. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.

with a radiologist to determine if there was any residual mass, following surgery to remove Patient
A’s breast cancer.

14. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as in
