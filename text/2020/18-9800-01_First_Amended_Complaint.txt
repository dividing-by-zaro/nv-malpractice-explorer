In the Matter of Charges and

Complaint Against

CARLOS ENRIQUE FONTE, M.D.,

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this First Amended Complaint (Complaint) against Carlos Enrique Fonte, M.D.
(Respondent), a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC’ has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively the
Medical Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent was licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical
Practice Act, on August 25, 1990, and is currently licensed in active status (License No. 6114).

Z. Patient A was a 90-year-old female at the time of the incidents in question. Her
name is not disciosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with a copy of this First Amended
Complaint.

3. At the time of the events in question, Patient A was a resident of a nursing home in
Las Vegas, Nevada, and suffered from dementia, among other conditions.


'The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time of filing of this First
Amended Complaint was approved, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Chairman, Aury Nagy,
M.D., and Michael C. Edwards, M.D., FACS.

4. On October 7, 2014, at a location outside of the nursing home, Respondent
implanted a pacemaker for Patient A, with no apparent complications at that time.

a: On October 20, 2014, Patient A complained of pain in her left hip and staff
reported a popping noise from the hip area upon movement of her left leg. An x-ray was ordered,
which showed no fracture or acute dislocation.

6. On October 21, 2014, nursing staff at the nursing home noted that Patient A’s left
foot was cool to the touch and exhibited skin color changes.

a On October 21, 2014, a venous duplex ultrasound was performed. It revealed no
evidence of a deep vein thrombosis. However, on the same date, an arterial duplex ultrasound
revealed “no flow present” in Patient A’s left proximal superficial femoral artery, left popliteal
artery, left anterior and posterior tibial arteries, and left dorsalis pedis artery. The report stated
that there was “severe mild atherosclerotic plaquing in the left lower extremity with no detectable
flow beyond the distal thigh.” Further evaluation with a computed tomography (CT) angiogram
was recommended.

8. From October 21, 2014 through October 29, 2014, Patient A’s progress notes
indicated that Patient A’s left leg was cool to the touch, exhibited skin color changes and Patient

A continued to experience pain in her left leg. Patient A was treated for pain.

0, On October 24, 2014, Patient A had a follow-up visit with Respondent for the

pacemaker implant. Upon information and belief, Respondent had limited medical records from

visit. Her primary care provider also had not contacted Respondent regarding Patient A’s recent
condition since October 20, 2014 and did not alert him to any concerns regarding Patient A’s leg.
10. Respondent’s medical records for the October 24, 2014 follow-up visit with Patient
A do not reflect the pain she had been experiencing in her left leg and do not indicate the pain
medication she had been taking since October 20, 2014. Respondent’s medical records of October
24, 2014, further reflect that Respondent examined Patient A’s legs and noted that pulses were
palpable and symmetrical, even though the arterial duplex ultrasound on October 21, 2014,

detected no flow present in Patient A’s left leg below the femoral artery. Respondent’s medical

records of October 24, 2014, listed eleven medications that Patient A was taking, but omitted the
hydrocodone she had been prescribed since October 20, 2014.

11. On October 29, 2014, Patient A was taken by ambulance to the emergency
department.

12, On October 29, 2014, Patient A underwent an ultrasound of her lower left leg and
an emergency angiogram, which showed total occlusion of the left limb aortic stent graft, left
common iliac, external iliac and common femoral arteries. The attending surgeon’s initial
assessment was that the leg would have to be amputated either above or below the knee.

13. On October 30, 2014, Patient A was taken to surgery for a bilateral, common
femoral endarterectomy, left profunda femoral endarterectomy, and a right femoral to left femoral
Gore-Tex graft, which surgery was successful and ultimately saved Patient A’s leg from

amputation.
COUNT I
(Failure to Maintain Timely, Legible, Accurate and Complete Medical Records)
14. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

reference as though fully set forth herein.
15. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate and

complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds for
initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

i6. Respondent failed to keep accurate and complete medical records when he
documented, inter alia, that Patient A’s left leg had palpable and symmetrical pulses, normal
dorsalis pedis pulses, and normal posterior tibial pulses, in spite of an arterial duplex ultrasound
that only days earlier detected no flow beyond the femoral artery, and Respondent failed to keep
accurate and complete medical records, as demonstrated by the fact that Respondent’s medical
records further listed 11 medications that Patient A was taking, but omitted the hydrocodone that
she had been prescribed since October 20, 2014.

17. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
