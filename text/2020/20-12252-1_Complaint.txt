IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

2. Bernard Kofi Addo-Quaye, M.D. (Addo-Quaye) was at all times relative to this
Complaint a licensed medical doctor holding an active license to practice medicine in the State of

six (46) months of imprisonment, among other sanctions.

4. On December 31, 2014, the Board revoked Respondent’s former license to practice
medicine (License No. 8652) pursuant to a Settlement Agreement and Order entered by the Board
on December 8, 2014.

5. Following Respondent’s release from incarceration, Respondent submitted to the
Board an application for licensure and preceptor plan. After an appearance by Respondent and
Addo-Quaye before the Board at a public meeting on September 7, 2018, and good case
appearing, the Board issued Respondent an “Active-Restricted” license to practice medicine for
the express purpose of permitting him to participate in a preceptorship with Addo-Quaye, whereby
Addo-Quaye was to supervise the medical activities of Respondent and report to the Board
regarding Respondent’s competence to practice medicine. The Board ordered Respondent to
complete a one-year preceptorship with Addo-Quaye, and explicitly restricted Respondent from
prescribing controlled substances for a minimum of twenty-four (24) months or until his probation
period lapses, whichever is greater, and subject to prior approval of the Board.

6. Addo-Quaye held, at all times relative to this Complaint, a controlled substance
registration, Certificate of Registration No. CS10103, issued by the Nevada State Board of
Pharmacy (Pharmacy Board).

7. Respondent, at all times relative to this Complaint, did not hold a controlled
substance registration, or any other kind of license to prescribe controlled substances or dangerous
drugs, issued by the Pharmacy Board.

8. Addo-Quaye, at all times relative to this Complaint, was the proprietor of “Bernard
Addo-Quaye, MD PC,” dba “TruCare Medical Center” (“TruCare”). TruCare is located at 2290
McDaniel Street, Suite 2A, North Las Vegas, Nevada.

9. Respondent was engaged as a contractor or otherwise employed by TruCare from
September 2018 to present.
