In the Matter of Charges and Complaint

Against

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Robert Kilroy, Esq., General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Ibrahim Fakhouri, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and
allegations as follows:

1, Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 14038). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 26, 2011.

2. On March 29, 2016, Respondent and fellow Board licensee Gary Manley, PA-C
(PA-C Manley) (License # PA1209) entered into a supervision of physician assistant agreement
(PA Supervision Agreement) pursuant to the Medical Practice Act.

3. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Respondent supervised PA-C Manley,
pursuant to a formal notice of supervision provided to the Board in accord with NAC 630.360(4),
wherein Respondent certified that he had read and was aware of all provisions of NRS Chapter

630 and NAC Chapter 630 concerning his duties as a physician supervising PA-C Manley.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal Complaint
was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Chairman, Aury Nagy, M.D., and
Michael C. Edwards, M.D., FACS.

4, Pursuant to NAC 630.370(5), Respondent was required to develop and carry out a
program to ensure the quality of care provided by PA-C Manley, and to maintain accurate records
and documentation regarding his program of supervision of PA-C Manley.

A. Respondent’s Supervision of PA-C Manley’s Treatment of Patient A

5. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his or her privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

6. Patient A was treated by PA-C Manley from May 31, 2016 through September 28,
2017, and PA-C Manley was supervised in his care of Patient A by Respondent, who reviewed
and signed off on all of PA-C Manley’s care of Patient A during this aforementioned time, often
with the notation of “I have reviewed the visit, discussed the case with the NP/PA/Resident and
agree with the findings and plan” in the medical records of Patient A.

7. PA-C Manley treated Patient A, who presented with a subjective complaint of 20
years of chronic back pain. With only a musculoskeletal examination at the initial visit, and the
majority of follow-up visits only documenting a condition of a “normal gait,” Patient A was
prescribed doses of opioids equivalent to 180 MME (Morphine Milligram Equivalents). From
August 2, 2016 through December 1, 2016, Patient A’s history of present illness, review of
systems, physical examination and the subjective information documented appears to be a series
of “cut-and-pastes” from visit to visit, and the following was indicated in the medical records:
“pain meds allow her to work...she is a dealer struggling to do her job.”” On July 5, 2016, Patient
A received a trigger point injection, but there was no documentation of why such procedure was
medically justified, location of such injection and how it (the injection) was tolerated nor if there
was improvement from such treatment. Additionally, the only documentation supporting the
aforementioned injection was that physical examination on July 5, 2016, that stated “normal gait,
right lumbar area lumbar TTP.” This aforementioned examination entry into the medical records
was the only musculoskeletal examination documentation throughout Patient A’s encounters with
PA-C Manley, for but the constant cut-and-paste entry “normal gait.”” On December 1, 2016,
Patient A received another trigger point injection despite Patient A’s medical records indicating an

unremarkable history, negative review of systems and negative physical examination. On

March 28, 2017, almost 10 months after receiving treatment from PA-C Manley, Patient A
provided a UDS (urine drug screen test), and these test results indicated a “negative” for
Temazepam (prescribed), a “positive” for Alprazolam (not prescribed) and a “positive” for
Methadone and Oxycodone (both prescribed). PA-C Manley took no subsequent actions or
informed the Patient of these UDS results, as this specific UDS was the one documented in the
medical record. PA-C Manley prescribed two benzodiazepines, Temazepam for insomnia and
Diazepam for psoriasis. Patient A did not execute an informed consent or patient education form
discussing the known risks with opioid dosages greater than 90 MME and current use of
benzodiazepines.

8. From June 26, 2017 through August 28, 2017, PA-C Manley did not inquire about
Patient A’s pain condition, yet PA-C Manley continued to write monthly (greater than 90 MME)
pain medications at each visit. Medical records note that PA-C Manley prescribed monthly
opioids and benzodiazepines without determination of how much Patient A required from the
previous month, and there was minimal evaluation of response or pain level inquiry from month to
month. Medical records of Patient A do not contain any clear rationale or medical justification,
and do not contain any physical or diagnostic evidence of chronic back pain. PA-C Manley, in his
care of Patient A, did not attempt to obtain any previous or current diagnostic evidence of Patient
A’s physiologic source of pain, did not request previous medical records, copies, or previous
imaging, did not order additional imaging, adjuvant therapies, and there was no consideration of a
referral to a pain management specialist. Only one Nevada Prescription Monitoring Program
(PMP) report was obtained for the duration of Patient A’s visits, but was not indicated in the

medical records.

B. Respondent’s Supervision of PA-C Manley’s Treatment of Patient B

30. Patient B’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his or her privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.
Patient B was treated by PA-C Manley from April 1, 2016 through September 8, 2017. PA-C
Manley was supervised in his care of Patient B by Respondent, who reviewed and signed off on
all of PA-C Manley’s care of Patient B during this aforementioned time, often with the notation
of: “I have reviewed the visit, discussed the case with the NP/PA/Resident and agree with the
findings and plan.”

31. | PA-C Manley treated Patient B, who at the initial visit stated that her pain was due
to a bodily assault and motor vehicle accident, and was found to have “lumbar and gluteal
tenderness” based upon PA-C Manley’s physical examination. Patient B was prescribed doses of
opioids equivalent to 225 MME (Morphine Milligram Equivalents) without physical or diagnostic
evidence of Patient B’s chronic pain condition.

32. On March 23, 2017, after more than 17 months of treatment under PA-C Manley’s
care, Patient B provided only one UDS, which indicated a toxicity screen consistent with
Respondent’s prescribed opioids and benzodiazepines, but inconsistent for codeine and
cannabinoids. PA-C Manley did not address these UDS results with either Patient B or in the
medical records. On April 18, 2017, Patient B complained of headaches not being controlled by
pain medications; this encounter is the first that there is a subjective pain assessment. A review of
symptoms from the medical records was for headache, back pain, and anxiety, which was not
consistent with the diagnoses and disproportionate opioid medication prescription therapy. From
October 26, 2016 through September 8, 2017, according to the medical records, the review of
symptoms for Patient B was negative for back pain and anxiety.

33. Patient B’s anxiety disorder was treated by PA-C Manley, who prescribed
Diazepam (10mg) (3x daily) without evaluation of her use, function or consideration of a
behavioral health referral. The medical records of Patient B do not indicate how or whether she
took the medicine as prescribed. Had PA-C Manley reviewed the PMP, then such would have

indicated that Patient B was not filling the aforementioned prescription, and perhaps this

Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(775) 688-2559



medication treatment was not required, or he would have recognized Patient B’s inconsistent
filling of excessive benzodiazepines and inquired about her use. PA-C Manley’s evaluation of
Patient B’s anxiety issues was “she presents with a history of depression with anxiety and she has
had an official diagnosis of anxiety disorder in the past by a medical professional.” From June
2016 to May 2017, Patient B filled the aforementioned quantities of Diazepam monthly; during
this aforementioned time, PA-C Manley did not inquire about this medication, nor further explore
her anxiety issues nor attempt to refer her to an appropriate mental health provider.

34. Patient B’s hypothyroid disorder was treated by PA-C Manley for at least six (6)
months without testing for the Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH). When this thyroid testing
was obtained, it indicated exogenous hyperthyroid, which can cause clinical manifestations such
as deceased bone density, increased fracture risk, mcreased incidence of atrial fibrillation,
increased heart rate and contractility, insomnia and anxiety. The treatment was to simply reduce
the thyroid medication therapy, but PA-C Manley did not address such with Patient B. From
month to month, PA-C Manley added the following assessment and plan to Patient B’s medical
record: “acquired hypothyroidism, medications with no change to current regimen.” One year
later, Patient B’s TSH results indicated a constant state of hyperthyroid. This test result was never
addressed in the medical records, and there was no change in her thyroid medication dosing,
which could have exposed Patient B to risks of osteoporosis, increased anxiety and cardiac
arrhythmias.

35. Patient B’s medical records do not contain any clear rationale or medical
justification, and do not contain any physical or diagnostic evidence of chronic pain. PA-C
Manley, in his care of Patient B, did not attempt to obtain any previous or current diagnostic
evidence of Patient B’s physiologic source of pain, did not request previous medical records,
copies, or previous imaging, did not order additional imaging, adjuvant therapies, and there was
no consideration for a referral to a pain management specialist. Nominal PMPs were obtained for
Patient B’s visits, and there was no informed consent or counseling of the risks of opioid drug

treatment.
