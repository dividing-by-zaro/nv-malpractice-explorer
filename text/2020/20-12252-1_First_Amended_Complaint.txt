FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC)' of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Aaron Bart Fricke, Esq., Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for
the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Victor Ronald Bruce, M.D. (Respondent),

2. Bernard Kofi Addo-Quaye, M.D. (Addo-Quaye) was at all times relative to this

entered its Judgment in a Criminal Case, adjudging Respondent guilty of violating 21 USC §§
846, 841(a)(I) and (b)(I)(C), conspiracy to distribute oxycodone, and sentencing him to forty-six
(46) months of imprisonment, among other sanctions.

4. On December 31, 2014, the Board revoked Respondent’s former license to practice
medicine (License No. 8652) pursuant to a Settlement Agreement and Order entered by the Board
on December 8, 2014.

5. Following Respondent’s release from incarceration, Respondent submitted to the
Board an application for licensure and preceptor plan. After an appearance by Respondent and
Addo-Quaye before the Board at a public meeting on September 7, 2018, and good case
appearing, the Board issued Respondent an “Active-Restricted” license to practice medicine for
the express purpose of permitting him to participate in a preceptorship with Addo-Quaye, whereby
Addo-Quaye was to supervise the medical activities of Respondent and report to the Board
regarding Respondent’s competence to practice medicine. The Board ordered Respondent to
complete a one (1) year preceptorship with Addo-Quaye, and explicitly restricted Respondent
from prescribing controlled substances for a minimum of twenty-four (24) months or until his
probation period lapses, whichever is greater, and subject to prior approval of the Board.

6. Addo-Quaye held, at all times relative to this Amended Complaint, a controlled
substance registration, Certificate of Registration No. CS10103, issued by the Nevada State Board
of Pharmacy (Pharmacy Board).

7. Respondent, at all times relative to this Amended Complaint, did not hold a
controlled substance registration, or any other kind of license to prescribe controlled substances,
issued by the Pharmacy Board.

8. Addo-Quaye, at all times relative to this Amended Complaint, was the proprietor of
“Bernard Addo-Quaye, MD PC,” dba “TruCare Medical Center’ (“TruCare”). TruCare is located
at 2290 McDaniel Street, Suite 2A, North Las Vegas, Nevada 89030.

9. Respondent was engaged as a preceptee of Addo-Quaye at TruCare from
September 2018 to present.

10. Addo-Quaye was out of the country from September 1, 2019, to

September 20, 2019.
COUNT I
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(3)
(Violation of Statutes and Regulations of the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy)

11. All of the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1-10 above are hereby incorporated
by reference as though fully set forth herein.

12. Respondent is a practitioner as defined by NRS 639.0125(1), as a physician, who
holds a license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada.

13. NRS 630.306(1)(b)(3) provides that engaging in conduct that violates a provision
of chapter 639 of NRS, or a regulation adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy pursuant thereto,
that is applicable to a licensee who is a practitioner, as defined in NRS 639.0125, is grounds for
initiating discipline against a licensee.

14. The Nevada State Board of Pharmacy adopted NAC 454.060, which sets forth
requirements for written prescriptions for dangerous drugs. NAC 454.060 incorporates and

includes the prescription requirements of NRS 454.223. In part, NRS 454.223(2)(a) provides:

2. A written prescription must contain:
(a) The name of the practitioner, the signature of the
practitioner if the prescription was not transmitted orally and
the address of the practitioner if not immediately available to
the pharmacist;

15. Respondent violated NAC 454.060 in that, as Addo-Quaye’s preceptee, and while
Addo-Quaye was out of the country from September 1, 2019, to September 20, 2019, Respondent
prescribed dangerous drugs by using Addo-Quaye’s blank prescription pads having Addo-Quaye’s
name pre-printed on the prescription forms. Respondent failed to cross-out Addo-Quaye’s name
on the prescription forms and write in his own name prior to Respondent signing his own name on
the prescription for dangerous drugs, in violation of NAC 454.060, a regulation of the State Board
of Pharmacy, because the above-referenced prescription did not contain Respondent’s name
(although it did contain Respondent’s signature), as required by NRS 454.223(2)(a) which is
incorporated by NAC 454.060, a regulation adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy.

16. _ By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Amended Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Amended Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an
Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it finds and concludes that
there has been a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, to include sanctions to be imposed; and

5. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these
premises.
