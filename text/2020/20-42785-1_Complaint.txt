6. Respondent admitted the following in the Colorado Medical Board action:

a. On or about February 3, 2015, Respondent examined Patient A for a Division
of Workers’ Compensation Independent Medical Examination (IME).

b. Respondent contacted Patient A by text and phone and by these means
engaged in communications of a sexual nature with Patient A between February 3, 2015 to
February 6, 2015.

¢. nor about February 7, 2015, Respondent filed his report regarding Patient
A’s IME.

d. Respondent had an obligation to be objective and impartial.

e. The Division of Workers’ Compensation (DWC) rules provide that a physician
shall “{n]ot evaluate an IME claimant if the appearance of an an actual conflict of interest exists.”

f. The DWC rules state: “During the IME process, there shall be no
communication allowed between the parties and the IME physician unless approved by the Director,
or an administrative law judge.”

& Contacting Patient A and engaging in communications of a sexual nature with
Patient A between February 3, 2015 and Feburary 6, 2015 breached appropriate professional
boundaries under the circumstances and thus fell below the generally accepted standards of medical
practice.

h. Respondent failed to meet the generally accepted stgandards of medical
practice, and thus engaged in unprofessional conduct by contacting Patient A after an IME and prior to
submission of his report regarding that IME and having conversation and sending text messages of a
sexual nature.

i. Respondent admitted that these acts and/or omissions constitute unprofessional
conduct as defined in Colorado law.

j. Respondent stipulated that discipline against him was authorized pursuant to
Colorado law.
