being hypotensive with a blood pressure of 103/86 mmHg and having supraventricular
tachycardia with a heart rate of 168 beats per minute (bpm) with atrial flutter after being

dosage with adenosine, Patient A’s heart rhythm converted to atrial fibrillation, and was then
administered with amiodarone.

an echocardiogram to be obtained the next morning.

and atrial fibrillation, Respondent gave hospital staff a verbal order to administer to Patient A
125mg of Cardizem, a negative inotropic medication, and 400mg amiodarone. Respondent then
ordered 50mg of verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, which was infused at or about
11:11 am. Additionally, Patient A received 250mcg of digoxin, and more verapamil and
Cardizem.
