Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

Ls Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 19826). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on April 29, 2020.

2. Patient A? was a forty-four (44) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3h, On March 7, 2023, Patient A presented to Respondents office for a pre-operative
evaluation for cosmetic surgery scheduled surgery on March 8, 2025. Patient A’s records
demonstrate she paid for the “mommy makeover” which includes breast augmentation, breast lift,
two (2) areas of liposuction. Patient A also requested and paid for chin liposuction.

4. Respondent did not see Patient A during the pre-operative visit, or at any time prior
to performing surgery March 8, 2025.

5. On March 8, 2025, Patient A presented to Respondent for surgery. Respondent’s
operative note document that the procedures performed were abdominoplasty, suction assisted
lipectomy of bilateral flanks and chin, mastopexy, and augmentation mammoplasty. According to
Respondent, Patient A requested the chin liposuction be substituted for liposuction of the mons
pubis. This was a conversation and a change in the surgical plan that is not documented in Patient
A’s medical records by Respondent. Moreover, the procedural note does not document that
Respondent performed liposuction of the mons pubis or chin, despite Patient A paying for three (3)
areas of liposuction.

6. At no time, prior to performing surgery, did Respondent perform a full physical

evaluation of Patient A prior to scheduling specific surgeries and collecting payment for those

surgeries.
