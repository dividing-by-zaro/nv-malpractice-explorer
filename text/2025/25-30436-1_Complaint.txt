drug (NSAID) to manage her knee pain, and also prescribed an opioid, Tylenol #3
(acetaminophen and codeine), in case the NSAID did not adequately manage her pain.

5. On October 29, 2014, Patient A underwent an x-ray of her right knee, which
demonstrated evidence of arthritis and/or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate disease (CCPD)

6. On November 4, 2014, Patient A underwent laboratory bloodwork that revealed
evidence of renal insufficiency, making her unable to tolerate long term pain management with
NSAID therapy.

7. On December 18, 2014, March 3, 2015, and March 17, 2015, Respondent
continued to recommend that Patient A use NSAIDs to manage her knee pain flare-ups, in
addition to Tylenol #3.

8. Respondent continued to prescribe opioids from 2014 until at least October 2021 to
manage Patient A’s right knee pain Over the course of this treatment, Patient A first prescribed
Tylenol #3, then switched to Tylenol #4, then switched to Norco (acetaminophen and
hydrocodone), and then to Percocet (oxycodone).

9. Respondents’ medical records concerning Patient A do not mention exploration of
non-pharmacologic options to treat Patient A’s right knee inflammation and pain prior to
prescribing opioids, such as referral to an orthopedic surgeon or referral to physical therapy.
Patient A’s medical records further do not mention if Respondent performed an arthrocentesis
with joint fluid analysis to confirm the diagnosis of CPPD, or if Respondent referred Patient A to
a rheumatologist or orthopedic specialist to perform the arthrocentesis with joint fluid analysis

10. Additionally, the mainstay of CPPD treatment consists of antiinflammatory agents
to reduce the inflammation generated by deposition of the calcium pyrophosphate crystals
Opioids generally do not effectively treat joint inflammation resulting from arthritis and/or CPPD.

11. Starting on or about October 2, 2014, Respondent also began prescri

benzodiazepines to Patient A in order to manage her anxiety and/or stress
12. Respondent's medical records concerning Patient A do not mention any referrals to
counseling prior to prescribing benzodiazepines. Additionally, Respondent's medical records

concerning Patient A do not mention a trial of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) prior

to prescribing benzodiazepines, even though SSRIs are less likely to cause sedation, cognitive side
effects, and/or risk of dependence than benzodiazepines.

13. Between October 2014 and October 2021, Respondent repeatedly prescribed
benzodiazepines and opioids concomitantly to Patient A, an older adult, at least twenty (20) times.
Respondent prescribed the opioid medications and NSAIDs for Patient A’s right knee
inflammation and pain and benzodiazepines for anxiety and/or stress. Patient A filled
prescriptions from Respondent for both Percocet and alprazolam consistently between 2020 and
2021.

14. Concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids by older adults increases the risk of
sedation and respiratory depression.

15. Additionally, between 2017 and 2021, Respondent prescribed opioids listed in
schedule II, III, or IV to Patient A over several intervals greater than ninety (90) days without
accessing the Nevada State Pharmacy Board’s Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) report.

16. Between 2011 and 2021, Respondent's records and notes concerning Patient A
were typically handwritten and barely legible.
