4. At 5:14 p.m, initial vital signs were taken, which included a temperature of 97.7
degrees Fahrenheit, a heart rate of 84 beats per minute (bpm), a measured blood pressure of
195/92, respiratory rate of 18, and pulse oximetry of 91% on room air

5. At 5:32 p.m., an electrocardiogram (EKG) was completed, which demonstrated a
sinus rhythm heart rate of 75 bpm.

6 At 5:41 p.m,, a nursing triage assessment note described “Pt experienced ‘racing
heart’ while walking to shuuttle [sic] for work this morning. Endorses a similar event 2 weeks
ago, as well as periods of heart palpitations [sic] ‘skipping a beat’ A straining feeling occurs
from bicep to L wrist occurs with heart palpatations [sic].” The note goes on to describe “SOB”
(shortness of breath) that “occurs during racing heart episode.” Patient A communicated to the
nurse that “[i]t hurts when I take a deep breath.” Lastly, Patient A was noted to be “speaking in
full sentences” with “even and unlabored” respirations

eA Repeat vital signs were taken for Patient A at 6:16 p.m. and included a heart rate of
83 bpm, a blood pressure of 136/80, respiratory rate of 14, and a pulse oximetry of 90% on room
air.

8. Patient A was evaluated by Respondent at 6:32 p.m., and Respondent documented
that Patient A stated he experienced a twenty-five (25) minute episode of “elevated heart rate with
associated chest discomfort which radiated down his left arm while walking to work this.
morning,” and the symptoms, “resolved after he arrived here and laid down.”

9. Patient A described three (3) episodes of heart palpitations that occurred two (2)
nights prior to his presentation at the ED. In one episode, Patient A described his experience as
palpitations accompanied by discomfort down the left arm, and in another episode, he experienced
palpitations accompanied by discomfort on the right side of his neck. Additional complaints
included three (3) weeks of respiratory congestion and pain with deep breathing, and insomnia
which he attributed to his work schedule. Patient A denied any family history of heart attacks, use
of any medications, and the use of drugs or alcohol.

10. Patient A’s physical exam was notable for a few reasons. First, he had a room air

pulse oximetry of 90%, second, he had a weight of 346.4 pounds (Ibs.) with a body mass index

(BMI) of 43 29. A cardiac exam demonstrated that Patient A had a regular rate and rhythm
without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Patient A was further described as breathing comfortably with
no respiratory distress and his Jungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, without any wheezes or rales.
Patient A's extremities had intact distal pulses without any clubbing, cyanosis, or edema, and his
skin was warm and dry.

11. A peripheral IV was established, and Patient A was placed on cardiac monitoring
with pulse oximetry. The medical decision-making documented by Respondent at 6:32 p.m.,
indicates that he made Patient A aware “...his palpitations may be caused by premature
ventricular contractions (PVC’s) which may be caused by stimulants such as caffeine use and
decreased sleep... he will likely need to follow up with cardiology to have a halter [sic] monitor
evaluation.”

12. At 6:46 p.m., Respondent ordered diagnostic studies which were comprised of a
complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an initial two (2) hour troponin level test,
and a chest x-ray.

13. The EKG was interpreted by Respondent as a “normal ECG” with “no significant
changes” compared with a prior baseline EKG from August 17, 2011.

14. At 7:00 p.m., repeat vital signs demonstrated a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure
of 128/77, respiratory rate of 20, and pulse oximetry of 92% on room air.

15. The chest x-ray was interpreted by the radiologist in the diagnostic report as
demonstrating “no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality” with “no evidence of infiltrate or other
acute process” and “no obvious pleural effusion.”

16. The initial laboratory results were unremarkable, with a normal highly sensitive
troponin I of 0.01 ng/mL.

17, At 8:51 p.m., according to the medical decision-making documentation by
Respondent, he “...[iJnformed the patient that his initial lab results are reassuring and do not
indicate any signs of a heart attack within the last two days, however I am repeating it at this time
to further evaluate. I discussed the risk factors for heart disease which he is on the low end of the

scale, Given this, and that he has not had any more palpitations since arriving here, its [sic]

i


unlikely his symptoms are secondary to a heart attack and are more likely secondary to benign
PVC’s.” Respondent goes on to write, “[rJecommended that he stop any caffeine intake and
reduce stimulation and focus on getting more sleep to help reduce these palpitations. Once his
second troponin lab returns, and if it is benign, he will be discharged with referral to cardiology to
have a halter [sic] monitor evaluation performed.”

18. At 9:07 p.m., a two (2) hour repeat sensitive troponin test was collected, and at
9:13 p.m, Respondent entered a nursing communication order indicating “[iJf second troponin is
negative may discharge.”

19. Vital signs at 9:30 p.m, demonstrated a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of
125/82, and pulse oximetry of 94% on room air.

20. At 9:45 pm., the repeat highly sensitive troponin J returned normal at 0.01 ng/mL.

21. Vital signs at 10:00 p.m. demonstrated a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of
117/76, respiratory rate of 14, and pulse oximetry of 92% on room air.

22. Further decision-making documentation by Respondent includes, “{cJlinically the
patient appears well and there is [sic] no significant abnormalities, The patient’s heart score is 1
which makes him a low-risk candidate for acute coronary syndrome. 2 troponins were obtained
there [sic] were both negative. Chest x-ray is normal on [sic] current EKG is normal and the
patient's been asymptomatic since he has been here.” Respondent then concludes, “{mly
impression is the patient is having a sensation of palpitations Could very well be PVCs or PACs
[premature atrial contractions] he did not have any other symptoms since he was in the hospital so
I could not see any of those findings. At this point I recommend after for the patient to follow-up
with cardiology for outpatient reevaluation to include a Holter monitor and return as needed. At
this point I do not feel the patient requires admission [to] the hospital for further stratification. 1
feel the patient is stable for discharge.”

23. An “After Visit Summary” was printed at 10 06 p.m., that included standardized
discharge instructions pertaining to “Palpitations”.

24. Patient A was discharged home with a final impression of “Palpitations,” and was

referred for follow-up in one (1) week with the Renown Institute for Heart and Vascular Health.

25. On March 26, 2019, two (2) days after Patient A’s initial presentation at Renown,
he was evaluated by a cardiologist at the Renown Institute for Heart and Vascular Health. Vital
signs taken at 4:15 p.m, included a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 124/70, and pulse
oximetry of 90% on room air. The cardiologist noted that with walking, Patient A’s heart rate
increased to 127 bpm and pulse oximetry decreased to 77%. At that time, the cardiologist ordered
a d-dimer test, an echocardiogram, overnight pulse oximetry, and a referral to pulmonology, with
a plan for close clinical follow-up.

26. Less than twelve (12) hours later, at 3:20 a.m., on March 27, 2019, Patient A was
transported via ambulance to the ED at Renown Regional Medical Center with a chief complaint
of shortness of breath and cough, and a reported pulse oximetry of 83% on room air. At that time,
Patient A was noted to have non-pitting edema of the left lower extremity. Laboratory blood tests
were ordered, and CT pulmonary angiography tests were ordered.

27. Pursuant to the blood panel results, Patient A’s troponin level was 0.53 ng/mL
[normal range: 0.00-0.04] and d-dimer level was elevated at 10.11 meg/mL [normal range: 0.00-
0.50], with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level showing normal at 36.

28. Per the radiologist’s interpretation, CT pulmonary angiography revealed
“[e}xtensive pulmonary thromboemboli right greater than left with evidence of right heart strain...
Multifocal consolidation mostly on the left is likely related to infarction... 4.3 cm ascending aortic
aneurysm.”

29. Patient A was placed on a heparin drip and treated with tissue plasminogen
activator (TPA) for submassive pulmonary embolus with right heart strain and was admitted to the
intensive care unit.

30. A venous Doppler ultrasound of the left lower extremity revealed acute venous
thrombosis of the popliteal and proximal posterior tibial veins.

31. Patient A underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter and was
subsequently discharged home three (3) days later, with a plan for six (6) months of oral
anticoagulation treatment.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice
32. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

33. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for i

iting,
disciplinary action against a licensee.

34. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

35. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when.
rendering medical services to Patient A, by failing to address Patient A’s multiple abnormal pulse
‘oximetry readings to rule out a pulmonary embolism. Further, the records reflect that Respondent
had already made the decision to discharge Patient A from the hospital at 9:13 a.m., when he
entered a nursing communication order indicating “If second troponin is negative may discharge,”
assuming the troponin test would be normal instead of pursuing a differential diagnosis of|
pulmonary embolism.

36. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

1, That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630,.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been

a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;
