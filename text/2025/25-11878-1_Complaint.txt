Against:

OVIDIU BRESCAN, M.D.,

FILED

MEDICAL EXAMINERS.

Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attomey for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Ovidiu Brescan, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter
630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC's charges
and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 8359). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on August 14, 1997, and has a specialty in anesthesiology.

2. Patient A? was a fifty-two (52) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. On November 27, 2017, Patient A presented to Summerlin Hospital for a
vitrectomy of the left eye with plans for anesthesia to be administered by Respondent, an
anesthesiologist.

4, Prior to the procedure, Respondent noted several potential anesthesia problems for

Patient A, including morbid obesity and a Mallampati IV scored airway, which 1s the highest

difficulty of an airway. Respondent further noted that Patient A had sleep apnea, hypertension,
and diabetes mellitus type I.

5. On the morning of November 27, 2017, Patient A entered the operating room for
the vitrectomy. When Respondent began induction of the anesthesia, Patient A became hypoxic
with bradycardia and the eye procedure was aborted.

6. Respondent attempted to intubate Patient A with an endotracheal tube, and then
used a laryngeal mask airway. Respondent took approximately forty-five (45) minutes to intubate
Patient A. During this time, Respondent administered multiple doses of atropine and epinephrine.

7. Also, during this time, Patient A developed hypotension and his oxygen saturation
was recorded between approximately 70% and 80%.

8. After Patient A’s airway was secured, at approximately 8:30 a.m., Patient A was
brought to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) intubated and sedated, with plans to admit
Patient A to the intensive care unit (ICU)

9. After arriving in the PACU, Patient A underwent an arterial blood gas (ABG) test
at approximately 8:41 a.m., which demonstrated a low Ph level of 7.3, an elevated partial carbon
dioxide (PCO2) level of 60.1, a partial oxygen (PO2) level of 390, and a bicarbonate (HCO3)
level of 29.3.

10. Patient A’s ABG results collectively were indicative of acute, non-compensated
hypercapnia’ and respiratory acidosis*.

11. Further, Patient A’s PO2 level at this time was falsely elevated due to mechanical
ventilation with 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi02).

12. Respondent performed a post-anesthesia evaluation at approximately 9:22 a.m. and
then left the PACU.

13, According to Respondent's notes, approximately ten (10) minutes after leaving the
PACU, a nurse called Respondent back to assess Patient A. The nurse told Respondent that

Mt

3 Hypercapnia is defined by abnormally elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood
“ Respiratory acidosis occurs when blood becomes too acidic due to the lungs failing to remove enough
carbon dioxide,

Patient A was awake, and Respondent evaluated Patient A and found that Patient A followed
Respondent’s commands.

14, Patient A’s recent ABG results indicating acute, non-compensated hypercapnia and
respiratory acidosis, and Patient A’s history of significant obesity and comorbidities, suggested
that Patient A likely would have suffered respiratory failure without the aid of ventilatory support

at this time, due to the probable inability to expel carbon dioxide and normalize acid base status.

15. Respondent extubated Patient A on November 27, 2017, at approximately
9:32 a.m.

16. Prior to extubation, Respondent failed to take steps to ensure Patient A met the
criteria for extubation at this time, such as performing a spontaneous breathing trial, including

repeat ABG tests, to ensure that Patient A had normal respiratory mechanics.

17. Further, Patient A did not have a stable clinical picture prior to the extubation, due
to possible pulmonary conditions caused by recent and significant periods of hypoxia,
hypotension, and extreme hypertension due to multiple doses of epinephrine and atropine.
Respondent's decision to extubate Patient A did not allow for further time to assess Patient A’s
pulmonary conditions under the controlled environment of a ventilated airway.

18. Respondent further did not discuss the plan to extubate Patient A with the wider
medical team of ICU physicians who had yet to evaluate Patient A, prior to extubating Patient A.

19. Patient A’s first post-extubation ABG was drawn at approximately 10:30 a.m.,
showing a Ph level of 7.31, PCO2 level of 44, a PO2 level of 54, 85% oxygen saturation, and an
HCO3 level of 29.3. Another post-extubation ABG was drawn at 11:56 a.m., showing a Ph level
of 7.31, a PCO2 level of 50, a PO2 level of 73, 93% oxygen saturation, and an HCO3 level of 25

20. At approximately 12:09 p.m., on November 27, 2017, PACU staff noted that
Patient A was not following commands and was desaturating. A pulmonary ICU team armved at
the PACU and determined that Patient A was in acute hypoxic respiratory failure, The ICU team
then intubated Patient A

21. Over the next several hours, Patient A developed a fever and a clinical picture

consistent with aspiration pneumonia, as well as altered mental status concerning for:

anoxic/hypoxic brain injury, both scenarios which could be directly related to Patient A’s
challenging intraoperative course and subsequent failure to remain extubated in the PACU.

22. Patient A thereafter underwent a prolonged hospital course. On December 8, 2017,
Patient A passed away, with his cause of death listed as acute cardiopulmonary arrest due to
severe sepsis, pneumonia, and unknown etiology.

23. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein

24. — NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating

25. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

26. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
treating Patient A on November 27, 2017, by prematurely extubating Patient A, when Patient A’s
recent ABG test results, medical history, and recent difficult intraoperative course indicated that
Patient A should have remained intubated at the time.

27. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

30. | NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

31. On November 27, 2017, Respondent failed to seek consultation with another health
care provider, such as an ICU physician, in a doubtful or difficult case, prior to extubating Patient
‘A. Such a consultation may have enhanced the quality of medical care provided to Patient A with
regard to the decision to extubate Patient A.

32. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complamt herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been

a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;
4, That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;
5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
