The above-referenced matters came for hearing on October 21, 2024 through October 24,
2024. The hearings were held by video conferencing between the State of Nevada Board of

Medical Examiners’ Reno and Las Vegas offices, with counsel for the Investigative Committee of
the State of Nevada Board of Medical Examiners (the “IC”), Sarah A. Bradley, and the
undersigned hearing officer appearing in Reno, and Respondent Dr. Matthew Obim Okeke
(“Respondent”) appearing from Las Vegas along with his counsel Liborius Agwara, Esq. The
matters were presented out of sequence commencing with Matter 4. For purposes of ease for
drafting this Findings and Recommendations, the matters will be addressed in the same order,
Matter 4

Matter 4 is premised upon a Complaint for seven claims for relief. Count I is Malpractice,

a violation of NRS 630.301(4), premised upon the allegation, in summary, that is was improper

for Respondent to prescribe a benzodiazepine (specifically alprazolam, the brand name of which


cer an a wWN


is Xanax) when he knew or should have known that the patient was also taking opioids; and/or
that Respondent failed to consider outside medical records regarding the patient’s use of opioids;
and/or by failing to properly document the patient’s treatment.

Count II alleges a violation of NRS 630.3062(1)(a), Failure to Maintain Complete Medical
Records, and is premised upon the allegations that the patent records at issue were copied and
pasted with data from other patients; and/or backdated; and/or failed to document review or
discussion of the patient’s Prescription Monitoring Program (“PMP”) report; and/or failed to
ensure the patient medications were updated and accurate each visit; and/or failed to document
any attempt to obtain outside medical records related to the patient’s use of opioids as prescribed
be any other provider.

Count Il is a charge of Engaging in Conduct that is Intended to Deceive, a violation of
NRS 630.306(2)(b)(1), and is premised upon the allegation that Respondent was not forthright
when representing to the Investigative Committee of the Nevada Board of Medical Examiners
(the “IC”) that he had only seen the subject patient twice.

Count IV alleges a violation of NRS 630.254(3), Failure to Notify the Board Regarding
Office Closure and Location of Patient Records as related to Respondent’s closing of his office
referred to as “Grand Desert.”

Count V, Failure to Notify the Board Regarding Change of Mailing Address, a violation of
NRS 630.254(1), is self-explanatory and relates to the closing of Respondent's office.

Count VI is for Failure to Provide Patient Records to Patient Upon Request, a violation of
NAC 630.230(2), and is premised upon the allegation that requested patient records had not been
timely provided and that the location of the records remains unknown.

The final charge, Count VII, is for Knowing or Willful Failure to Comply with a Provision
of NRS Chapter 630, a violation of NRS 630.3065(2)(c), and is premised upon Respondent’s
alleged knowingly and willful failure to have provided contact information upon the closure of his
office and his failure to disclose the location of the patient records that are the subject of Count
VI.

BSRRRBBREBSBVLBSERWIARRERES

Throughout the course of the hearing, IC Exhibits 1 through 10 were admitted.

The IC’s first witness was the IC’s Chief Investigator Ernesto Diaz, who authenticated
exhibits and through whom Exhibits 1-5 were admitted. Mr. Diaz also supported Count III,
Engaging in Conduct that is Intended to Deceive, a violation of NRS 630.306(2)(b)(1), by
testifying that medical records contradict Respondent’s response to IC inquiries regarding having
only seen Patient A twice.

The IC’s next witness was Bryan Czerniski, M.D., a licensed Nevada psychiatrist, who
testified to his credentials (see Exhibits 9-10, which were admitted), and opined that Respondent
fell below the standard of care by prescribing a benzodiazepine, specifically alprazolam, to a
patient who was on opioids and by further failing to document related risk factors, Transcript pp.
47-50 (abbreviated hereafter as “T” with page numbers following). According to Dr. Czerniski,
Respondent should have checked the patient’s PMP report before prescribing any controlled
substance. T 50. Dr. Czerniski further testified that the combination of a benzodiazepine with an
opioid can lead to respiratory distress and increase the chances of “mortality by tenfold,” (T 53-
54), and that alprazolam (a benzodiazepine) should not be utilized long-term for someone with
anxiety due to the state of withdrawal causing more anxiety, especially if there is a history of
alcohol use disorder because the withdrawal can induce alcohol cravings, T 56-57, 63-65, 86. Dr.
Czerniski expressed concern about the alprazolam prescription due to a history of seizures and the
withdrawal increasing the chance of seizures. T 57-58. Based upon these risks, Dr, Czerniski
testified that the alprazolam should have been tapered off. T 59.

According to Dr. Czerniski, Respondent’s records indicate that after Respondent checked
the PMP report, he did decrease the alprazolam dosage but did so too abruptly without proper
titration and then inexplicably bumped the dosage back up. T 60-61, 107. Dr. Czerniski further
testified that there is no indication that Respondent collaborated to establish a shared treatment
program with the patient’s other provider(s) in light of the alprazolam he had prescribed and
opioid prescription another provider had prescribed, nor did Respondent document the basis for

his alprazolam prescription and dosage changes, T 62, 99,

Cet AH a wD

BRRRRERRBEBSVERRARRRBEEREES

As to Respondent’s medical records, Dr. Czerniski noted concerns about notations being
cloned, meaning copied and pasted from other records. T 66, 71-3. He also expressed that the
medication list was unclear due to duplication and dosages, and that date entries were either auto-
populated after the visit or subject to having been changed, which is contrary to records being
required to be maintained as they were made after they are finalized. T 67-68, 71.

Adverse reactions as a result of the benzodiazepine prescription of alprazolam with the
opioids as specific to Patient A was brought out in cross-examination, as to which Dr. Czerniski
testified that the adverse reactions resulted in twelve emergency department visits, with ten of
those during times the PMP report was kept, and eight of those having followed within two days
of the Xanax prescription (alprazolam, which again, is a benzodiazepine). T 78-79. Notes related
thereto provide “[p]rofound sedation due to medication of substances” but there is no way of
knowing if the patient was compliant with medication instructions; although, the description is
consistent with an overdose of alprazolam or a mixture of alprazolam and opiates, which Dr.
Czerniski opined was the cause, T 79-83.

It was established on cross-examination that the patient had already been prescribed
benzodiazepines by another provider, Dr. Kroegel, in 2019, and that when Respondent saw the
patient three years later in September 2021 and October 2021, according to Dr. Czerniski,
Respondent should have taken the patient off the alprazolam in consultation with the patient’s
other providers by tapering the patient off in consideration of the patient’s seizure disorder and
“rebound anxiety.” T 89-96, 99-100.

The IC’s next witness was Darla Zarley who is the Prescription Monitoring Program
Administrator for the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy. T 120. Relevant to the charges, Ms.
Zarley testified that the PMP records indicate that Respondent first ran a PMP inquiry for the
patient on September 16, 2021, at which time Respondent prescribed the patient alprazolam (a
benzodiazepine) despite the patient already being prescribed oxycodone (an opioid). T 123.

The next to testify was Johnna LaRue, the Deputy Chief of Investigations and Compliance
Officer for the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners. T 131. Ms. LaRue testified that

Respondent’s license was moved from active to inactive on June 9, 2023 in accordance with


we eo rIAA HA AWD

BRNRRKREBRRFESVERRARDRTARES

admitted Exhibit 6, which is an email from Respondent’s counsel requesting that Respondent’s
license be moved to inactive. Exhibit 7, which is an allegation letter regarding Respondent’s
failure to provide Patient B his or her records, was also admitted through Ms. LaRue. T 136-38.
Exhibit 8, which is an envelope marked undeliverable to Respondent’s address on file with the
Board was also admitted. T 138-39. Ms, LaRue further testified that Patient B’s records were
never provided despite having been requested. T 140. On cross-examination, Ms. LaRue
indicated that she did not follow up on the returned mail with Respondent by calling him but that
she had tried to email him with no response. T 142-43,

Respondent for his case presented only his testimony, by which he testified that it is not
his practice to prescribe benzodiazepines but will continue such prescriptions for existing users (T
146); Respondent lowered the patient’s benzodiazepine prescription because he was not
comfortable with the amount currently prescribed (T 148-49); the patient was not prescribed the
benzodiazepine by him originally (T 149); that the reduction he gave was drastic so he increased it
again to help the patient cope (T 150); and that he still maintains the address where his practice
was located and that the Board has on file but there was no one there to sign for the mail the
Board sent that was returned (T 150).

On cross-examination, Respondent acknowledged that he did not note any reasoning for
the changes to the benzodiazepine prescription dosages. T 151. Then on re-direct, Respondent
testified that the two times he saw the patient in 2021 and 2022 he was just covering and,
therefore, did not want to make drastic changes to the patient’s prescriptions. T 153.

and II

As to whether Respondent committed malpractice by prescribing benzodiazepines while
he knew or should have known that the patient was taking opioids, the rub is that the patient was
already prescribed benzodiazepines when the patient was seen by Respondent, who testified he
was covering for another provider, Per the IC’s expert, although it was inappropriate to allow the
benzodiazepine prescription to continue, that being Xanax in particular, it also was not
appropriate to cease the prescription altogether. Given the foregoing, I cannot recommend a

finding that Respondent committed malpractice by continuing to prescribe the benzodiazepine.


we ern anaeawn

BRRRREKRBRRESVSITABRRBREKS

However, it remains that Respondent’s records are not appropriately reflective of the basis for his
actions with respect to the continuing prescription, its increase and decrease, and there is no
indication that he took care to address the problems that arise with the prescription in
consideration of concurrent opioid use. The records also have cloned entries. The manner by
which the records tracked prescriptions is also problematic in that, as testified to by Dr. Czerniski,
the medication list was unclear due to duplication and dosages, and that date entries were either
auto-populated after the visit or subject to having been changed, which is contrary to records
being required to be maintained as they were made after they are finalized. T 6-68, 71. The failure
to make and maintain appropriate medical records is pleaded as the basis for malpractice claim as
well as the failure to maintain complete medical records claim. Given the duplicity, I recommend
finding a violation on Count II.

Count IIL

Count III is engaging in conduct that is meant to deceive and is premised upon
Respondent’s written response to the IC’s investigation whereby Respondent indicates that he
only saw the patient at issue twice, which was not accurate. Respondent actually saw the patient
eight times - twice in 2021 and six times in 2018. T 102; Exhibit 3.

The letter upon which Count II is based was written by Respondent’s counsel but was
adopted by Respondent and his signature appears on it. See Exhibit 2. The letter from the IC that
the Respondent was answering referenced treatment of the patient “for years” and was focused on
the prescription of narcotics to the identified patient. See Exhibit 1. The times that Respondent
saw the patient and prescribed narcotics were the two visits in 2021.

In reviewing the statute, NRS 630.306, it is focused on actions that are the basis for
initiating an investigation and, if warranted, disciplinary proceedings, and is not tailored to
responding to the IC once an investigation is underway; but, even assuming the statute could be
applied in such an instance, given the context of the inquiry and the timeframe Respondent could
assume was at issue, I cannot find that Respondent referencing the two recent visits rises to the
level of an intentional deception, particularly when Respondent provided all the records that
included the visits from 2018. T 37-38.


BNRRRBBREBSEPSBWIABRDESERRS

Counts d VI

Counts IV, V, and VI are for failure to notify the Board about the office closure and
location of records; failure to notify the Board regarding a change of address; and failure to
provide patient records to a patient upon request. Respondent did not defend his failure to provide
patient records, As to the office closure and change of address, Respondent testified that he
maintains that address although he closed his practice.

Given Respondent closed his practice, mail sent by the Board was returned, and the patient
records remain unaccounted for, I submit that Respondent should be held accountable for each of
these three counts. If a practitioner closes an office and cannot be reached by the Board by
certified mailing, that is a problem and is the exact problem the mandates outlined in the counts
are meant to address, It is particularly unacceptable that the patient records at issue in Count VI
remain unaccounted for.

Matter 1

Matter 1 commenced upon the amendment of the Complaint as provided for on the record.
A true and correct copy of the Complaint as amended was filed on October 29, 2024. The exhibits
were also addressed and updated on the record, The parties stipulated that Respondent was out of
the country from February 26, 2017 through March 11, 2017; September 27, 2017 through
October 2, 2017; and June 30, 2018 through July 7, 2018; and November 9, 2018 through
November 23, 2018, as stated in paragraph two of the Complaint as amended.

Counts 1-66 are for malpractice, a violation of NRS 630.301(4), as alleged with regard to
patients A through NNN, and is premised upon the allegation that Respondent failed to use the
reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when rendering
medical services because he billed for services not rendered, prescribed controlled substances via
paper prescriptions when he was out of the country, failed to check the PMP as required by
Nevada law, and failed to examine patients prior to writing prescriptions for controlled
substances.

Counts 67 through 79 relate to patients A through M and are for failure to maintain
complete medical records, a violation of NRS 630.3062(1\(a), premised upon Respondent’s




alleged failure to completely and correctly document medical care and treatment and/or by over-
reliance on templated material in the records, causing the same to be untimely, illegible,
inaccurate, and incomplete.

Counts 80 through 136 relate to patients C, E, and J through NNN excluding L and M, and
are premised upon alleged violations of statutes and regulations of the Nevada State Board of
Pharmacy, a violation of NRS 630,306(1)(b)(3), specifically Respondent's alleged failure to run
PMP reports as required to prescribe controlled substances.

Counts 137 through counts 197 plead violations of NRS 630,3062(1)(b)(3), Fraudutent,
Illegal, Unauthorized, or Otherwise Inappropriate Prescribing of Controlled Substances Listed in
Schedule Il, III, or IV, in relation to patients C, E, G, and I through NNN, alleging that
Respondent pre-signed prescription pads for his staff or other practitioners to utilize while he was
out of the country.

Counts 198 to 204 are premised upon alleged violations of Engaging in Conduct that is
Intended to Deceive, a violation of NRS 630.306(2)(b)(1), in relation to patients A, B, D, E, F, G,
and H based upon providing services under his name and NPI number that he did not provide,
which is deceptive.

Counts 205 through 211, relate to alleged violations of NRS 630.305(1)(d), Charging for
Services Not Rendered, for allegedly charging patients A, B, D, E, F, G, and H for services that
were not rendered.

The parties stipulated to numerous exhibits as identified on the record and removed others
based upon Respondent’s stipulation to not running PMP’s for 57 patients as is relevant to Counts
80-136.

The IC’s first witness was Emesto Diaz, the Board’s Chief Investigator, who testified as to
Respondent’s National Provider Identification number and to patient visit records of November
12-14, 2018 and November 20-21, 2018 — dates Respondent was out of the country. Transcript of
October 22, 2024, pp. 50-56, The same testimony was given for the dates of February 28, 2017;
September 27, 2017; November 24, 2018; November 9-10, 2018; November 16-19, 2018, in


BRRRFERPBBRSEVCRSETABRDREBRES

addition to some overlap of prior dates. T 57-59. On cross-examination, Respondent implied the
visits were by “telemed.” T 60-62.

The IC then called Dr. Jayleen Chen, a psychiatrist, who testified as to her qualifications
and that Respondent did not meet the standard of care by failing to have established a “bona fide
patient/prescriber relationship” when having purportedly seen patients and prescribing controlled
substances while out of the country, as well as failing to write progress notes to support the
prescriptions. T 62, 67-71.

Per Dr. Chen, billing records indicate that the visits were office visits, that being that the
place of service was the office; and, if the visits were by telehealth, that should have been noted.
T 75-79, Dr. Chen also testified that electronic prescriptions, ‘versus paper, are now the norm for
prescribing controlled substances but, in relation to this matter, Respondent purported to have
issued paper prescriptions while out of the country. T 80. It was surmised by Dr. Chen that the
paper prescriptions were dated in such a manner as to be issued while Respondent was out of the
country (T 81-86) as opposed to being filled out with “do not fill” until a certain date, which is the
proper manner to issue future prescriptions. T 83. Dr. Chen also testified that it is not allowed for
someone other than Respondent to have given the paper prescriptions to the patients. T 87. Dr.
Chen further testified that Respondent’s records contained copying and pasting and duplicate
medication listings with differing dosages. T 89-91, 107. Dr. Chen also confirmed that a check of
the PMP database was not undertaken when it should have been. T 93. On cross-examination, Dr.
Chen was questioned about other care workers who are part of a treatment team billing under
Respondent’s Medicare billing code, which was referenced as “14.” T 102-103. On redirect Dr.
Chen testified that compromised prescribing credentials must be reported. T 110.

Respondent testified and addressed his experience (T 118-19); that he did not run the
required PMP inquiries based upon his electronic medical record program giving the same
information (T 119-21, 123-26, 138); and that, at the time at issue, it was acceptable to “postdate”
written prescriptions (that being to write a future date), which is what Respondent did so that his
patients would not run out of their prescriptions and face withdrawal symptoms (T 121, 126, 140-
42). Respondent also testified that he was on the telephone with the provider seeing his patients



BNRERRRBRRESSREARRRESEEES

on unidentified occasions when the provider treating the patient had questions (T 122-23), and
that other levels of providers would bill Medicaid under a general billing number that was also
reflective of the number he used and, therefore, the usage of that number was not necessarily
identifying as to him (T 126-131). On cross-examination, Respondent testified that a billing code
“20” as opposed to a “14” would be the other psychiatrist affiliated with the office or the nurse
practitioner but likely the nurse practitioner because the other psychiatrist would have put their
name (T 136-37),

After Respondent’s testimony, Darla Zarley of the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy was
recalled as a witness by the IC, and testified that Respondent’s EMR system was not integrated
with the PMP system until July of 2020 (T of October 23, 2024, pp. 6-7) and reiterated that a PMP
report was required to be run as of January 1, 2018. T 9.

Counts I=LXVI

Counts J-LXVI are for malpractice, defined by NAC 630.040 as “the failure of a physician
. .. in treating a patient to use reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used for similar
circumstances,” and are premised upon billing for services not rendered, prescribing controlled
substances via paper prescriptions while out of the country, failing to run PMP reports as required
by law, and failing to examine patients prior to writing prescriptions for controlled substances.

Respondent stipulated to being out of the country for the dates at issue and, therefore, did
not examine the patients (and only conferring by phone with providers who did see them on
occasion per his own testimony); admitted to not running the PMP reports as required by law;
postdated prescriptions without complying with NAC 453.450(4), which applies to Schedule II
substances, and otherwise postdated written prescriptions for controlled substances outside of
Schedule II substances; and billed for treatment of the identified patients as demonstrated by
billing records that, regardless of the PT code (which Respondent referred to as a Medicaid code
that could apply to other levels of providers), reference Respondent as the provider by and



BAR KFSSSF SVU RAR ATHAHES

through his name, electronic signature, and NPI Code, As such, I recommend finding against
Respondent for these counts.!
Co -LXxXIX

These counts allege that Respondent failed to maintain timely, eligible, accurate and
complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of the identified patients
by failing to completely and correctly document his care and treatment for each of the patients at
issue and/or over-relying on templated material. The only direct testimony regarding the same
came from Dr. Chen who substantiated the allegations and, therefore, I suggest finding against
Respondent on these counts.

Counts LXXX — CXXXVI

These counts are for violation of statutes and regulations of the Nevada State Board of
Pharmacy and is premised upon failure to run the PMP reports as addressed in counts I- LXVI.
Based upon Respondent’s admission to failing to run the PMP reports, Respondent should be
found to have violated these counts.

Counts C: Il-CXCVII

These counts are for fraudulent, illegal, unauthorized, or otherwise inappropriate
prescribing of controlled substances listed in Schedule IL, III, or IV and are based upon the
postdating of the prescriptions as was addressed in counts I ~ LXVI; however, the premise is that
Respondent postdated the prescriptions and then provided them to office staff or other
practitioners to hand out while he was out of the office. There is no testimony that was proffered
to substantiate that and, contrary thereto, Respondent indicates that he postdated the prescriptions
and himself provided them during previous appointments. October 22, 2024 T 139-40. This was
not refuted by the IC and, therefore, I cannot recommend that Respondent be held in violation of
these counts as pleaded.
Mt

' There are numerous patients at issue and, given the parties treated them as a block to which all allegations and
defenses apply, the undersigned hearing officer likewise did so and, therefore, did not address each patient
individually in making the above findings. This applies to all of the counts addressed with respect to Matter 1.

“1


BRBPRBRRBRBSEBEBRRRETBHE SB

Counts CXCVIII —- CCIV and Counts CCV - CCXT

These counts are in relation to seven identified patients who Respondent purported to
provide services to while he was out of the country and are premised upon engaging in conduct
intended to deceive and charging for services not rendered.? As set forth herein, I find that
services were purportedly rendered and billed for that did not take place. To the extent that is
deceptive, I recommend a finding that Respondent violated these counts.

Matter 2

This matter is similar to Matter 1 in that it alleges malpractice based upon prescribing an
identified patent benzodiazepines when the patient was taking opioids and also prescribing five
patients controlled substances by paper prescription when he was out of the country; failing to run
each patient’s PMP report; and failing to examine the patients prior to writing the prescriptions.
The complaint also alleges counts for failure to maintain complete medical records in the same
manner as addressed in Matter 1, that being over reliance upon templated material and/or cutting
and pasting; counts premised upon violation of statutes and regulations of the Nevada State Board
of Pharmacy for the failure to run the PMP reports; counts for fraudulent, illegal, unauthorized, or
otherwise inappropriate prescribing of controlled substances listed in Schedule II, III, or IV by
pre-signing paper prescriptions and providing them to staff and/or other practitioners to provide to
patients while he was out of the country; and counsel for engaging in conduct that is intended to
deceive by making misleading statements in response to the IC investigation. Matter 2 was heard
on October 23, 2024 and continued through October 24, 2024 and is summarized as follows.

The IC’s first witness was its Chief Investigator Ernesto Diaz who authenticated records
and addressed Respondent’s response to the IC investigation letter whereby Respondent indicated.
that he never authorized Dr. Victor Bruce to write any prescriptions. October 23, 2024 Transcript,
pp. 20-41. Mr. Diaz also testified that as of his time at the IC, since March 2020, he had not ‘

received any information about Respondent’s prescribing credentials being compromised. T 43.

2 The IC’s statutory citation at to counts CXCVIIL - CCIV is “NRS 630.306(2)(b)(1)” but is apparently meant to be
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(1).


we or annawn

BRRRFRERBRRKESSERVTABRDTESEEKS

On cross-examination Mr. Diaz was asked about the scope of any investigation he personally
performed, T 46-49.

The IC next called Darla Zarley, the Prescription Monitoring Program Administrator with
the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy who testified that the PMP reports run for the patients at
issue were not run within the time period at issue as required by law. T 51-54. Ms. Zarley also
testified that she was not notified of Respondent’s prescribing credentials having become
compromised. T 55. On cross-examination, Ms. Zarley testified that the PMP report showed that
Respondent prescribed controlled substances to the patients subject to the complaint (T 57), and
that the prescription should have been called in by the prescriber who saw the patient (T 59). As
to Exhibit 20 in particular, Ms. Zarley testified that it looked like a person named “Mary” called
the prescription in on behalf of Respondent, T 59-60. In response to questioning from the
undersigned hearing officer, Ms. Zarley further testified that the prescribing credentials would
come from whoever called in the prescription and, as to Exhibit 20, the number given was not
Respondent’s but could have been written down wrong. T 61-64, Respondent’s prescribing
credentials were then identified for the record. T 64-65. It was then established that a prescriber
would not necessarily know if his or her credentials were being improperly used, which is why
prescribers are required to run their related reports every six months to ensure their credentials are
related solely to prescriptions they have issued. T 65-66. In follow up it was established that
Exhibit 17 contains Respondent’s credentials, as is the case for Exhibit 25, and a query for
Respondent attributes Exhibit 20 to him. T 67-70. As for each of the prescriptions in Exhibits 17,
20, and 25, they were called in and would have been written down by the pharmacist. T 71.

The IC’s next witness was Jayleen Chen, M.D., a psychiatrist who testified to her
credentials and experience. Dr. Chen then testified that she opined that Respondent fell below the
standard of care by prescribing benzodiazepines to Patient A who has been receiving opioids from
another provider as well as having failed to run the PMP and took issue with the clarity and
accuracy, by way of copying and pasting, of Patient A’s records. T 79-91, 97-98, 101, 109-10,
126-27. Dr. Chen then addressed Respondent prescribing a controlled substance to Patient B on a
date Respondent should have seen the patient to properly do so but was out of the country and for


Cc mar nna vn

BNRRRBRRESSEREAVAEBDRESEREES

which no PMP inquiry was made, T 113-15. Moving to Patient C, Dr. Chen testified that Patient
C was prescribed a controlled substance on a date when Respondent was out of the country and,
therefore, undertook the prescription without having seen the patient and for which no PMP report
was run. T 115-18. The same testimony was also given for Patient D and Patient E, each action
testified to by Dr. Chen having been deemed by her to fall below the appropriate standard of care.
T 118-23. Dr. Chen then expressed ongoing concern about the clarity of the records and cutting
and pasting versus providing tailored notations for different visits. T 124-26.

On cross-examination, Respondent represented that Sana Behavior Health is a treatment
facility or hospital of which he was the medical director and, therefore, his role was to oversee
treatment of all patients. T 130-31, 134. It was also established that three of the five patients at
issue were Respondent’s patients, T 132-33; October 24, 2024 T S. As to Patient D in particular,
by reference to Exhibit 21, Dr. Chen testified that she attributed that patient’s care to Respondent
because Respondent was listed as the psychiatrist on the record and a prescription was written
under Respondent’s name (which patients were Respondent’s was never sorted on the record). T
133-36, Dr. Chen testified that when the prescription for Patient D that is part of the record as
Exhibit 20 was written, Respondent was out of the country and, therefore, someone else wrote the
prescription and Dr. Chen assumes it was authorized by Respondent; however, under questioning
she acknowledged that the pharmacist writes the physician’s name and could have put the primary
doctor as opposed to the physician that ordered the prescription. T 138-41. Dr. Chen then testified
that she was assuming Respondent was the attending physician for Patient D and that if that was
not the case and was the medical director then she “could see that being ok,” referring to
Respondent not being present to provide care given his role of overseeing patient care. October
24, 2024 T 6. With Respondent not having left to go out of the country until the evening of
November 8, 2019, Dr. Chen also testified that the prescription for Patient B could have been
issued by Respondent that day (T 7-8), and that her main concern with Patient A was
Respondent's failure to run a PMP report and lack of appropriate record documentation but agreed
that it was not appropriate for Respondent to run a PMP for a patient that was not his (T 9-10).



BRRRREBRARKBSESERADREBSREKS

On redirect, Dr. Chen reiterated that to prescribe a controlled substance, a PMP report
must be run by the prescriber and that the prescriber must see the patient. T 12-13. As to Patient
B, looking at Exhibit 14, the attending physician for October 10, 2019 was Respondent and for
November 8, 2019 was Debra Perkins and it was surmised that Respondent provided the
prescription dated for November 8, 2019 on October 10, 2019, which is inconsistent with
Respondent's statement in Exhibit 4 that he did not postdate the November 8, 2019 prescription. T
13-15.

On recross, Respondent established that Exhibit 17 was a written prescription that was
undertaken while Respondent was out of the country and, therefore “had nothing to do with
[Respondent]” and that Dr. Chen did not “have a problem with whatever role, if any, that
[Respondent] played with respect to these exhibits (17, 20, and 25],” which Dr. Chen agreed with.
T 17-18.

On final redirect, Dr. Chen reiterated the requirement for post-dating prescriptions at the
time, that being that they had to have the date of the day they were undertaken and had to provide
“do no fill” until a certain date with no more than three prescriptions from the same issuing date.
T 19-20.

When the undersigned hearing officer attempted to clarify Dr. Chen’s testimony with
respect to whether it was appropriate that the called in prescriptions were attributed to Respondent
even though he was out of the country when they were issued, Dr. Chen stated that it was
appropriate because Respondent was the medical director. T 20-22.

Counts I-V

These are malpractice claims based upon several allegations, the first of which is that
Respondent prescribed Patient A benzodiazepines while she was taking opioids. This was
attributed to Respondent having failed, admittedly, to run a PMP report.

Exhibit 7 contains Patient A’s medical records and Respondent is consistently listed as her
attending physician from 2013 to 2019. As such, Patient A does not present a scenario where
Respondent was covering for another provider or was unfamiliar with her prescription history.

Thus, to the extent it was not refuted that Patient A should not have been prescribed


cor AH a wHN

eax nh dk oONReE SODA A HA RF ONES

benzodiazepines while taking opioids, I recommend that Respondent be held accountable for this
portion of this count,

The remaining basis of the malpractice claim is that Respondent prescribed controlled
substances to Patients A through E while he was out of the country, without checking a PMP
report, and without conducting corresponding examinations. As to Patient A, the record does not
reflect, so far as undersigned has been able to determine, that Patient A was prescribed any
controlled substances while Respondent was out of the country and without conducting
corresponding examinations, although he did not run PMP reports in conjunction with prescribing
controlled substances for other dates and should be held accountable for that reason. With respect
to Patient B, it was determined that Respondent could have personally seen that patient to
facilitate the prescription but, again, did not run the PMP report, for which he should be held
accountable. As to Patients C, D, and E, those were Sana Behavioral Health patients and, per
testimony, their prescriptions could have been appropriately linked to Respondent as the Medical
Director and not necessarily as the attending physician, which Dr. Chen testified was not
problematic.> The fact that the burden was not met as to those patients as to each of the counts
(not just the malpractice counts) was somewhat conceded by the IC on the record. T 31-32. To the
extent that what remains of this count is duplicative of what remains of counts XI-XVI as to
Patients A and B, undersigned recommends that these violations be accounted for in the latter
counts and not encompassed in allegations of malpractice.

Counts VI-X

These counts relate to patients A through E and are premised upon Respondent’s failure to
maintain complete medical records in that such records were lacking in relevant notations,
reflected copying and pasting, etc. This was a consistent concern throughout each of the hearings

and the state of the records was no different in relation to this matter. As such, Respondent should

3 Undersigned was surprised to hear Dr. Chen testify, and even clarify when queried by undersigned, that
prescriptions could be called in under Respondents name as the facility Medical Director when he was not the
physician who saw tho patient or directed the prescription. I do not believe this to actually be accurate but that is what
the record bore out and I have rendered this recommendation in accordance with the record and the testimony
provided,


wer AnH RF WY

BRRFERRBREBSSCSEAARARREEREES

be held accountable for these counts in relation to Patients A and B (with the counts as to Patients
C, D, and E being excluded for the reasons set forth above).
Counts XI-XV1

These counts are for violation of pharmacy regulations related to Respondent’s admitted
failure to run PMP reports in relation to Patients A through E. To the extent Respondent is
responsible therefore in relation to Patients A and B, Respondent should be held accountable.

Counts XVII-XX

These counts are for fraudulent, illegal, unauthorized, or otherwise inappropriate
prescribing of controlled substances for allegedly pre-signing prescriptions and would be relevant
as to Patients C, D, and E. For the reasons set forth above, the burden of proof for these counts
have not been satisfied.

Counts XXI-XXIV.

These counts are based upon Respondent's statements in response to investigative inquires
by the IC that he checks “the PMP regularly” and in relation to what he guessed may have taken
place with regard to Patients C, D, and E. As noted elsewhere herein, undersigned does not
interpret the conduct complained of as a violation of NRS 630.306(1)(b)(3), but which is
presumably meant to refer to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(1), because undersigned does not interpret the
statute to include conduct or statements made in response to an already pending IC investigation.
The statute states that deceitful conduct “constitutes grounds for initiating disciplinary action.”
Given disciplinary action had already commenced by way of an opened investigation, I do not
find that this conduct is actionable as pleaded. How I interpret that statute is that deceitful conduct
can be the basis to open an investigation and subject a physician to subsequent consequences.
That being said, there is no doubt that such misrepresentations support a lack of credibility and
support related culpability.

Matter 3

This matter involves a patient with whom Respondent admittedly had a personal/sexual

relationship and entails counts for malpractice; failure to maintain complete medical records;

violation of statutes and regulations regarding the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy; unsafe or



PRePPRRRBERBTEER BERR BE
2Iranan & ne So OIA HB WN eS

unprofessional conduct; disreputable conduct; violation of a patient’s trust and exploitation of
physician/patient relationship for financial or personal gain; and fraudulent, illegal, unauthorized,
or otherwise inappropriate prescribing of controlled substances,

The parties stipulated to the admission of exhibits 1-6, 10, and 11.

The IC’s first witness was Ernesto Diaz, the Chief of Investigations for the IC who
testified to having reviewed text messages between Respondent and the Patient dated February
2021 through June 2021.

The IC next called Darla Zarley, the administrator of the Prescription Monitoring Program,
who testified that a prescribing physician is required to run a PMP report each time a controlled
substance is prescribed and every 90 days thereafter, October 24, 2024 transcript, p. 29. Ms.
Zarley also testified to Exhibits 4 and 5, which demonstrated that Respondent ran two PMP
reports in relation to the Patient on March 18, 2022 as reflected in Exhibit 4 despite having
prescribed controlled substances to her on several other occasions (Exhibit 5). T 27-29.

The IC then called Jayleen Chen, M.D., a psychiatrist who testified to her credentials and
who further testified to the impropriety of having a romantic relationship with a patient. T 32-37.
Dr. Chen expressed concern regarding medications being prescribed with no premise therefore
being documented, high dosages, and failure to run PMP reports, as well as concern about
Respondent’s romantic relationship with the patient and incomplete records that were, at times,
hard to follow and included inapplicable diagnosis and cutting and pasting. T 38-48.

Respondent testified that he was already dating the Patient when he began to treat her and
admitted it was wrong for him to do so, indicating that the Patient then began to threaten and
extort him, including threatening to report him to the Nevada States Board of Medical Examiners,
and that he had been negatively financially impacted as a result of his relationship and the
Patient’s demands upon him. T 53-57.

Count I

This is a count for malpractice, a violation of NRS 630.301(4) and is based upon
Respondent having treated the Patient while having a personal relationship with her; prescribing
controlled substances without running corresponding PMP reports; and failing to justify in his



BRRRFRTESERRSEUCRARARTBERES

medical records a prescription for Ambien and a prescription for Adderall, which was
overprescribed, These allegations have been substantiated and Respondent should be held
accountable.
Count II
This count is premised upon failure to maintain accurate and complete medical records, a
violation of NRS 630.3062(1)(a). Dr. Chen’s testimony was that the records kept were insufficient
and her testimony was not disputed. Respondent should be held accountable for such.
Count IT
Count III is for violation of statutes and regulations of the Nevada State Pharmacy Board,
a violation of NRS 630.306(1)(b)(3), and is premised upon Respondent's failure to run PMP
reports, which was established and for which Respondent should be held accountable.
Count IV
This count is for unsafe or unprofessional conduct, a violation of NRS 630.306(1)(p), and
is based upon the overprescribing of Adderall and engaging in a personal relationship with the
Patient and/or prescribing her controlled substances. This conduct was established and unrefuted.
Respondent should be held accountable accordingly.
Count V
Disreputable conduct as set forth in NRS 630,301(9) is conduct that brings the medical
profession into disrepute, including, without limitation, conduct that violates any provision of a
code of ethics adopted by the Board by regulation based on a national code of ethics, Having a
sexual relationship with a patient is patently unethical and is a violation of the same statute,
subsection (5), “engaging by a practitioner in any sexual activity with a patient who is currently
being treated by the practitioner.” While not charged under section 5, which is exactly on point, it
remains that the same conduct brings the medical profession into disrepute and is a violation for
which Respondent should be held accountable.
Count VI
Count V1 is for violation of patient trust and exploitation of the physician and patient
relationship for financial or personal gain, a violation of NRS 630.301(7). Respondent’s position


eo eran a wn


was that he was the victim of exploitation at the hands of the Patient in that the Patient utilized
their relationship to exploit Respondent for financial gain; however, it cannot be overlooked that it
was Respondent that put himself into that position for personal gain — that being the benefits of an
ongoing personal/sexual relationship. Regardless of the fact that Respondent may have already
been dating the Patient when he started treating her, her reliance upon him for medications and/or
treatment that then becomes tied to an ongoing sexual relationship is exploitive, cannot be
condoned, and was unequivocally a breach of trust regardless of any unfavorable actions the
Patient may have responded with.
Count VII
The final count is for the fraudulent, illegal, unauthorized or otherwise inappropriate
prescribing of controlled substances, a violation of NRS 630.3062(1)(h). Prescribing controlled
substances to a patient without whom Respondent was personally involved was inappropriate and
Respondent should be held accountable accordingly.
Matter 5
Matter 5 was dismissed by and through an Order for Dismissal With Prejudice, filed on
October 29, 2024, and signed by Brett W. Frey, M.D., Chair of the IC.
BASED UPON THE FOREGOING, in summary, it is recommended that Respondent be
held accountable for the following:
Matter 1: Counts I-LXVI;
Counts LXVII-LXXIX;
Counts LXXX-CXXXVI;
Counts CKCVIII-CCIV; and
Counts CCV-CCXI
Matter 2: One count of Counts I-V for prescribing benzodiazepines to Patient A
