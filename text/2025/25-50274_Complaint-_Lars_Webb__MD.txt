was prescribed dexamethasone, 0.75mg (a glucocorticoid drug), to be taken daily for an indefinite

7. Patient A was steroid dependent at the time of consulting with Respondent, as his
body had no ability to create the affected hormones without taking the medication he was prescribed.
Patient A took the medication daily, however, he was instructed by Respondent to discontinue the
medication ten (10) days prior to his scheduled gastric sleeve surgery.

bradycardic, with a heart rate of $2. In speaking with Patient A, the nurse noted that Patient A had

low heart rate. Patient A was taken to the operating room at 7:18 a.m.

10. Patient A was still bradycardic when on the operating room table, and the
anesthesiologist gave Patient A atropine, but his body did not respond. He was then given
epinephrine and became tachycardic and hypertensive, and thus was given labetalol, which

normalized his vital signs. Patient A was then induced under anesthesia; however, the end tidal
