4. Patient A’s cosmetic treatment included Botox injections for wrinkles, laser
treatment for the removal of a neck tattoo, and laser treatment for the removal of a skin
discoloration (birthmark) on her breast area.

5. Starting August 6, 2014, Respondent became the Primary Care Physician (“PCP”)
for Patient A, and he began treating Patient A for multiple issues including chronic wrist/hand
pain due to tendinitis, chronic back pain, major depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and
continuing acne treatment. Patient A also saw Respondent for acute issues including acute upper
respiratory infections.

6. Respondent was Patient A’s PCP from August 6, 2014, to July 30, 2019, when
“[he] terminated the doctor-patient relationship by certified mail leaving her time to find another
physician,” as Patient A’s medical insurance was no longer accepted by Respondent's medical
practice and Patient A had accrued sizeable medical debt

7. Throughout the course of Respondent’s treatment of Patient A, many, if not most,
of the medical issues Patient A saw Respondent for were psychiatric in nature.

8. Respondent is not a psychiatrist, rather, he is the sole practitioner of Reno Sparks
MedSpa, which offers, “state of the art technology to help you improve the appearance of your
skin,” and he is certified in Internal Medicine and (previously) Geriatric Medicine. Despite this,
Respondent never consulted with a psychiatrist or referred Patient A to a physician specializing in
that field.

9. In 2018, Respondent wrote prescriptions for Patient A, which included, nine
hundred and forty-two (942) Oxycodone 10mg (a Schedule II controlled substance), six hundred
and forty-two (642) Dextroamphetamine 20mg (a Schedule II controlled substance), eight hundred
and ninety-five (895) Clonazepam Img (a Schedule IV controlled substance), and one hundred
and twenty (120) Zolpidem 10mg (a Schedule IV controlled substance). All of these medications
are controlled substances.

10. During the period of January 3, 2019, to August 11, 2019, Patient A filled
prescriptions written by Respondent for three hundred and twenty-five (325) Oxycodone 10mg,

2mg, one hundred and twenty (120) Clonazepam Img, and twenty-one (21) Hydrocodone 10 mg.

11. During the approximately five (5) year period that Respondent was Patient A’s
PCP, there were no documented drug toxicity tests, Patient Risk Assessments, nor is there
documentation of informed written consent for controlled substances,

12, Further, there is no documentation for a Risk of Abuse Assessment or a
Prescription Medication Agreement.

13. Despite this, Respondent continued to prescribe controlled substances for over
three hundred and sixty-five (365) days, he prescribed opiates and benzodiazepines together, and
he never completed a self-query of his prescriptions.

14. Additionally, there was evidence of prior opioid abuse and/or dependence and on
July 23, 2018, Patient A was prescribed Tramadol for use for pain associated with withdrawal
symptoms (withdrawal from oxycodone per the chart notations).

15. Despite the symptoms of withdrawal when not using oxycodone, the medication
was continued with no other interventions.

16. On January 10, 2020, Patient A self-referred herself to a psychiatrist. with
complaints of an opioid addiction and depression. The psychiatrist diagnosed Patient A with
Opioid Use Disorder, and she was started on Buprenophine. Patient A was also diagnosed with an
unspecified mood and anxiety disorder

17. On September 17, 2020, Patient A’s psychotherapist charted that Patient A had a
serious prescription pain pill addiction, costing her an estimated one hundred fifty dollar ($150)
per day,

18. On September 10, 2021, Patient A began regular psychotherapy visits.

19, Respondent's treatment of Patient A resulted in, among other things, her
developing a severe opioid addiction requiring long-term psychiatric care and a treatment program
with Buprenorphine.

medications, benzodiazepines, and amphetamines over an extended period of time, ultimately
leading to Patient A’s need for opioid addiction treatment and long-term psychiatric care.

24, Further, Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge used

treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions when he treated
Patient A, by, among other things, not documenting any Drug Toxicity Tests, any Patient Risk
Assessments, informed written consent for Patient A’s long-term use of controlled substances, a
Prescription Medication Agreement, as well as a Risk of Abuse Assessment. Thus, Respondent's
medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

OUNT III

condition from August 6, 2014, to July 30, 2019, and Respondent should have consulted with an

a timely consultation would have confirmed or denied a particular diagnosis that would likely

psychiatric condition.

34, By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
