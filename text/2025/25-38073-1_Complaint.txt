4. During the January 19, 2021, visit, Respondent had access to Patient A’s lab results
from January 14, 2021, and Patient A agreed to bio-identical hormone replacement theory (BHRT).
Respondent also discussed a 21-day purification program with Patient A.

5. Patient A’s Free T4 was 0.93, her Free T3 was 2.6, and TSH was 0.896 (all
considered in the normal range). Despite Patient A’s normal test results, Respondent still prescribed
a thyroid hormone as a primary treatment for Patient A’s self-described “hormone imbalance”
depression, anxiety, and fatigue.

6. On January 21, 2021, Patient A had telehealth visit with Respondent's nurse
practitioner, who confirmed she would start BHRT protocol per Respondent.

7. On February 16, 2021, Patient A had a telehealth visit with Respondent. Patient A
stated some improvement in symptoms, but had a couple of episodes of heart palpitations, and some
morning fatigue. The plan that Respondent documented was to increase Patient A’s progesterone
prescription medication to 250mg SR (sustained release).

8. On March 18, 2021, Patient A had a telehealth visit with Respondent who reviewed
Patient A’s March 16, 2021, lab results. Patient A noticed some improvement in symptoms and
said she had been taking the medications as instructed. Patient A’s lab results were optimal thyroid
profile, normal CBC (complete blood count), improved MCV (mean corpuscular volume) level,
optimal DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), optimal vitamin D, improved ferritin and iron levels, low
normal and free testosterone. ‘The plan Respondent implemented in this visit was to decrease Patient
A's progesterone medication to 225 mg SR, increase her testosterone medication to Smeg, decrease
her DHEA SR to Smg and increase her NP thyroid to 90mg.

9. On April 14, 2021, Patient A had another telehealth visit with Respondent and noted
she was doing well on BHRT and had been taking the prescribed medications as instructed.
However, Patient A complained of fatigue and nausea prior to her menstrual cycle. The plan noted
by Respondent was to make no changes to Patient A’s medication regimen.

10. On May 24, 2021, Patient A had her last visit with Respondent, which was also by
telehealth means. Patient A told Respondent that she was still taking her medications as instructed.

10 mg, and start NP thyroid 120 mg qam (every morning).
COUNTI
NRS 630.306(1)(g) - Continual Failure to Exercise Skill or Diligence

11. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

12. Continual failure by the Respondent to exercise the skill or diligence or use the
methods ordinarily exercised under the same circumstances by physicians in good standing
practicing in the same specialty or field are grounds for disciplinary action against a licensee
pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(g).

13. Respondent continually failed to exercise skill or diligence as demonstrated by his
repeated inability to appreciate the complications presented in Patient A, in addition to improperly
evaluating the laboratory results.

14. In January 2021, Respondent failed to exercise skill or diligence when he diagnosed
Patient A with hypothyroidism and prescribed her thyroid hormone replacement, despite her thyroid
lab results being normal and her complaint was regarding depression, anxiety, and fatigue.

15. In March 2021, Respondent failed to exercise skill or diligence when, despite
writing in his records that Patient A had an “optimal thyroid profile,” he increased her NP thyroid
to 90 mg daily, when her lab results showed evidence of iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis. Increasing her
dose of NP thyroid put Patient A at a greater risk of having many serious adverse events, including
heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease.

16. In May 2021, Respondent failed to exercise skill or diligence when he made an.
improper recommendation to Patient A to increase the NT Thyroid to 120 mg, despite Patient A
indicating that her heart would race and she experienced shortness of breath when taking that dose.

17. During this time, Respondent improperly relied on Patient A’s subjective symptoms
rather than objectively evaluating her for tremors, weight loss, DTR (deep tendon reflex), or check
her pulse.

18. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
COUNT IT
NRS 630,306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation

19. All of the allegations contamed in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

20. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

21. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

22. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition from January 2021 through May 2021, and Respondent should have consulted with an
appropriate care provider such as a physician specializing in endocrmology to address the
doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition and such a timely consultation would
have confirmed or denied a diagnosis and may have enhanced the quality of medical care provided
to Patient A with regard to her complaints of depression, anxiety, and fatigue. Further, Respondent
should have encouraged Patient A to seck psychiatric evaluation given two (2) of her major
complaints were depression and anxiety.

23. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.306(1)(e) - Practice Beyond Scope of License

24. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

25.  NRS 630.306(1)(e) provides practicing or offering to practice beyond the scope

permitted by law or performing services which the licensee knows or has reason to know that he or

she is not competent to perform, or which is beyond the scope of his or her training constitutes
grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

26. Respondent has not demonstrated to the Board that he has the requisite training in
endocrinology but has shown evidence that he did not understand how to treat Patient A’s thyroid
issues. Respondent has also not demonstrated to the Board that he has the requisite training in
psychiatry.

27. Patient A was treated with hormone replacement therapies for a thyroid disorder and
other hormone disorders which are not within the scope of practice for a physician that has listed
obstetrics and gynecology as their specialty which is what Respondent has listed as his specialty
with the Board.

28. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

tL That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
