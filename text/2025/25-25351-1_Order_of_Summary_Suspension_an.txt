Hestdalen, M.D. (Respondent) from the practice of medicine, pursuant to the Board’s authority to
regulate the practice of medicine in the State of Nevada pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes

Prior to the preparation of this Order of Summary Suspension, Board Staff presented to the
IC the following:

1 Respondent is a medical doctor licensed to practice medicine in the State of
Nevada (License No. 10215). The Board issued her license on July 1, 2002.

change from inactive to active status. Respondent’s license was inactive during a period when she
was seeking treatment for substance abuse. She was in recovery at that time and wished to re-enter
the practice of medicine.

3. Following the June 5, 2024, meeting, the Board issued an Order Granting License.
with Conditions with the requirement that Respondent successfully complete a preceptor plan for
twelve (12) months under the supervision of Dr. Byron Czerniski, a Senior Psychiatrist at Lakes
Wy

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this Summary

Crossing (“Board Order”). She was further notified that she must return to the Board to request.
that the conditions be removed from her license.

4. Dr. Czemiski agreed to report on Respondent’s progress and notify the Board of|
any concerning pattern in work performance, attendance, documentation, or clinical decision
making.

5. Dr. Czerniski has notified the Board of his concerns with Respondent’s work
performance and attendance. Specifically, on January 3, 2025, Respondent was late arriving to
work at Lakes Crossing and seemed to be in an altered status. Respondent entered the monthly
staff meeting seemingly disorganized, in addition to coworkers observing that she smelled of|
alcohol.

6. Additionally, on the evening of January 3, 2025, Respondent texted Dr. Czerniski
and stated that she had relapsed in her sobriety.

7. As of January 6, 2025, Respondent no longer works at Lakes Crossing. As such,
Dr. Czerniski notified the Board of the termination of the preceptorship.

8 Respondent’s failure to complete the preceptorship under Dr. Czerniski is a
violation of the conditions of the Board Order.

= Based on the foregoing, the IC finds that Respondent has willfully and knowingly
violated the Board Order and is immediately suspended from the practice of medicine in the State
of Nevada. See NRS 630.326(1).

10. Accordingly, the IC issues this Order of Summary Suspension based on its
determination that Respondent's failure to comply with the Board Order puts the health, safety or
welfare of the public at risk of imminent harm pursuant to NRS 630.326(1) and
NRS 233B.127(3).

ORDER

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the License of Kristin Adele Hestdalen, M.D. (License
No. 10215) is SUMMARILY SUSPENDED until further order of the IC or Board, and Licensee
is prohibited from engaging in any acts that constitute the practice of medicine pursuant to
NRS 630.020; and
