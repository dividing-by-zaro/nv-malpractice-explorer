NEVADA STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY,
CASE NO. 21-183-CS-S
Petitioner,
v.
SHARRON THOMPSON, M.D., FINDINGS OF FACT,
Certificate of Registration No. CS31142, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW,
AND ORDER
Respondent,

This matter came before the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy at its regularly scheduled meeting
on Wednesday, December 6, 2023. Gregory L. Zunino, Senior General Counsel, prosecuted the case
before the Board. Respondent Sharron Thompson, M.D., Certificate of Registration No. CS31142,
failed to appear after being properly noticed of the time, date, and place of the hearing. Pursuant to
NRS 622A.350(2) and NRS 638.244(2), the Board adopted, as its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of
Law, the allegations, averments, and legal conclusions stated in the Notice of Intended Action and
Accusation on file herein. Those allegations, averments, and legal conclusions are restated below with
minor conforming changes, as appropriate, to reflect the Board’s determination to impose professional
discipline in this case.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1, The Nevada State Board of Pharmacy (“Board”) has personal jurisdiction over
Respondent Sharron Thompson, M.D. (“Thompson”), because Thompson holds a certificate of
registration issued by the Board that authorizes her to prescribe controlled substances in Nevada.
Thompson holds certificate of registration no. CS31142, which was issued by the Board pursuant to
NRS 453.226 and NRS 453.231,

2. The Board has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this accusation because, at the time
of the violations alleged herein, Thompson was engaged in the “practice of pharmacy” as that term is

defined at NRS 639.0124.

i
3. Copies of the Notice of Intended Action and Accusation, and the accompanying
Statement to the Respondent and Notice‘of Heating, were properly served upon Thompson at her last-
known address on record with the Board.

4, Thompson is a physician licensed by the Nevada Board of Medical Examiners to
practice medicine in Nevada. In 2021, Thompson practiced medicine at the Las Vegas Comprehensive
Pain Management Center (“LVCPMC”, located at 8930 West Sunset Road, Suite 350, in Las Vegas,
Nevada.

5. At all times relevant fo this case, Thompson was a “practitioner” as that term is defined
at NRS 639.0125 and NRS 453.126,

6. Tn 2021, Thompson worked in partnership or association with, or was employed by
David James Smith, M.D. (“Smith”), who then identified himself as the “Medical Director” of the
LVCPEMC. *

7. Smith has never held a certificate of registration issued by the Board. Thompson has
held her certificate of registration since December 15, 2020.

8 In 2019 and 2020, Smith held a financial interest in Direct Compounding and
Outsourcing, LLC (“Direct Compounding”), which owned and operated a compounding pharmacy in
Henderson, Nevada, In 2021, the Board revoked Direct Compounding’s pharmacy license due to
mismanagement and lack of drug security.

9. Smith relied upon Thompson to procure and prescribe any controlled substances that
were administered or dispensed to patients of the LVCPMC.,

10. Thompson permitted Smith to use Thompson’s name and credentials to prescribe and/or
dispense controlled substances to patients of the LVCPMC. Thompson did so by signing prescription
blanks and then leaving them at the LVCPMC in an area where Smith could access them, complete the
necessary information on the blank, and then transmit the completed prescriptions to pharmacies.

11. Thompson knew or should have known that Smith used Thompson’s name and

credentials to prescribe and/or dispense controlled substances to patients of the LVCPMC,


12, On September 2, 2021, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched and/or
occupied the premises of the LVCPMC based on suspicions that Smith had over-prescribed fentanyl
and other controlted substances.

13. Board Investigator Kenneth Scheuber accompanied federal agents as they searched
and/or occupied the premises of the LVCPMC on September 2, 2021. While on the premises,
Investigator Scheuber discovered prescription blanks that had ostensibly been signed by Thompson.
Three signed prescription blanks contained no date, no patient information, and no drug information.
A fourth signed prescription was dated and contained patient information, but it contained no drug
information.

[4. While on the premises of the LVCPMC, Investigator Scheuber photographed the areas
where the LVCPMC stored dangerous drugs and controlled substances, Investigator Scheuber later
asked Thompson to respond to his written questions about the storage and labeling of the dangerous
drugs and conttolled substances depicted in the photographs, some of which had been purchased from
Direct Compounding.

15, In her written communications with Investigator Scheuber, Thompson admitted to a
lack of familiarity with LVCPMC’s practices and procedures concerning the procurement, storage, and.
disposal of dangerous drugs and controlled substances. Thompson stated that questions would be more
appropriately directed to Smith.

16. While on the premises of the LVCPMC, Investigator Scheuber observed several vials
and containers with labels indicating that their drug contents had been held beyond their expiration
dates. When asked about these expired drugs, Thompson could not explain why the expired drugs were
commingled with other non-expired drugs, or why the expired drugs had not been destroyed,

17. According to their fabels, the expired drugs at the LVCPMC included fentanyl,
clonidine hydrochloride, baclofen, dexamethasone, and injectable vitamin solutions. Fentanyl is
classified as a controlled substance under both state and federal law. See 21 C.F.R. § 1308.11; NAC
453.520(3). The others are “dangerous drugs” as that term is defined at NRS 454,201.


18, In her written statement dated March 27, 2023, Thompson generally acknowledged that
the LVCPMC had improperly stored and/or had failed to label dangerous drugs and controlled
substances, Thompson attributed blame to Smith and stated that she had terminated her employment
with the LVCPMC,

19, | Thompson admitted that she had signed prescription blanks before filling them out.

20, Between January 1, 2021, and September 2, 2021, Thompson commingled or allowed
persons under her supervision to commingle expired drugs and controlled substances with non-expired
drugs and controlled substances.

21, The expired and non-expired drugs and controlled substances were commingled in an
area where LVCPMC maintained its stock of useable drugs and controlled substances.

22, Between January 1, 2021, and September 2, 2021, Thompson stored or allowed persons
under her supervision to store unlabeled dangerous drugs and/or controlled substances in an area where
LVCPMC maintained its stock of useable drugs and controlled substances. These dangerous drugs
and/or controlled substances were “nonsterile compounded drug products” as that term is defined at
NAC 639.6665,

23. When asked about the unlabeled drugs and/or controlled substances, Thompson could
not identify them or confirm their origin.

24, Between January 1, 2021, and September 2, 2021, Thompson possessed at least 3
prescription blanks that she had signed before filling them out. During the same time frame, Thompson
possessed at least 1 signed prescription that contained no drug information. This supports an inference
that Thompson planned to allow other persons at the LVCPMC, including Smith, to use her name and
credentials to prescribe controlled substances in her absence.

25. As the holder of a certificate of registration issued by the Board, Thompson had a legal
duty to understand and comply with Nevada's statutes and regulations governing the storage, labeling,

prescribing, and dispensing of dangerous drugs and controlled substances,

v.

SHARRON THOMPSON, M.D.,
Certificate of Registration No. CS31142,

Respondent.

CASE NO. 21-183-CS-S

NOTICE OF INTENDED ACTION
AND ACCUSATION

J. David Wuest, in his official capacity as Executive Secretary of the Nevada State Board of

Pharmacy, files the following document that will serve as both a notice of intended action under NRS

233B.127(3) and an accusation under NRS 622A.300(1) and NRS 639.241.

JURISDICTION

1. The Nevada State Board of Pharmacy (“Board”) has personal jurisdiction over

Respondent Sharron Thompson, M.D. (“Thompson”), because Thompson holds a certificate of

registration issued by the Board that authorizes her to prescribe controlled substances in Nevada.

Thompson holds certificate of registration no. CS31142, which was issued by the Board pursuant to

NRS 453.226 and NRS 453.231.

2. The Board has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this accusation because, at the time
of the violations alleged herein, Thompson was engaged in the “practice of pharmacy” as that term is
defined at NRS 639.0124.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

3. Thompson is a physician licensed by the Nevada Board of Medical Examiners to
practice medicine in Nevada. In 2021, Thompson practiced medicine at the Las Vegas Comprehensive
Pain Management Center (“LVCPMC”), located at 8930 West Sunset Road, Suite 350, in Las Vegas,
Nevada.

4. At all times relevant to this accusation, Thompson was a “practitioner” as that term is
defined at NRS 639.0125 and NRS 453.126.

5. In 2021, Thompson worked in partnership or association with, or was employed by
David James Smith, M.D. (“Smith”), who then identified himself as the “Medical Director” of the
LVCPMC.

6. Smith has never held a certificate of registration issued by the Board. Thompson has
held her certificate of registration since December 15, 2020.

7. In 2019 and 2020, Smith held a financial interest in Direct Compounding and
Outsourcing, LLC (“Direct Compounding”), which owned and operated a compounding pharmacy in
Henderson, Nevada. In 2021, the Board revoked Direct Compounding’s pharmacy license due to
mismanagement and lack of drug security.

8. On information and belief, Smith relied upon Thompson to procure and prescribe any
controlled substances that were administered or dispensed to patients of the LVCPMC.

9. On information and belief, Thompson permitted Smith to use Thompson’s name and
credentials to prescribe and/or dispense controlled substances to patients of the LVCPMC. On
information and belief, Thompson did so by signing prescription blanks and then leaving them at the
LVCPMC in an area where Smith could access them, complete the necessary information on the blank,

and then transmit the completed prescriptions to pharmacies.


10. On information and belief, Thompson knew or should have known that Smith used
Thompson’s name and credentials to prescribe and/or dispense controlled substances to patients of the
LVCPMC.

11. On September 2, 2021, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched and/or
occupied the premises of the LVCPMC based on suspicions that Smith had over-prescribed fentanyl
and other controlled substances. On information and belief, Smith has since been indicted by a federal
grand jury in California on charges related to his prescribing activity. Smith is also the subject of
pending disciplinary action by the Nevada Board of Medical Examiners.

12. Board Investigator Kenneth Scheuber accompanied federal agents as they searched
and/or occupied the premises of the LVCPMC on September 2, 2021. While on the premises,
Investigator Scheuber discovered prescription blanks that had ostensibly been signed by Thompson.
Three signed prescription blanks contained no date, no patient information, and no drug information.
A fourth signed prescription was dated and contained patient information, but it contained no drug
information.

13. While on the premises of the LVCPMC, Investigator Scheuber photographed the areas
where the LVCPMC stored dangerous drugs and controlled substances. Investigator Scheuber later
asked Thompson to respond to his written questions about the storage and labeling of the dangerous
drugs and controlled substances depicted in the photographs, some of which had been purchased from
Direct Compounding.

14, In her written communications with Investigator Scheuber, Thompson admitted to a
lack of familiarity with LVCPMC’s practices and procedures concerning the procurement, storage, and
disposal of dangerous drugs and controlled substances. Thompson stated that questions would be more
appropriately directed to Smith.

15. While on the premises of the LVCPMC, Investigator Scheuber observed several vials

and containers with labels indicating that their drug contents had been held beyond their expiration

dates. When asked about these expired drugs, Thompson could not explain why the expired drugs were
commingled with other non-expired drugs, or why the expired drugs had not been destroyed.

16. According to their labels, the expired drugs at the LVCPMC included fentanyl,
clonidine hydrochloride, baclofen, dexamethasone, and injectable vitamin solutions. Fentanyl is
classified as a controlled substance under both state and federal law. See 21 C.F.R. § 1308.11; NAC
453.520(3). The others are “dangerous drugs” as that term is defined at NRS 454.201.

17. Inher written statement dated March 27, 2023, Thompson generally acknowledged that
the LVCPMC had improperly stored and/or had failed to label dangerous drugs and controlled
substances. Thompson attributed blame to Smith and stated that she had terminated her employment
with the LVCPMC.

18. Thompson admitted that she had signed prescription blanks before filling them out.

19, Between January 1, 2021, and September 2, 2021, Thompson commingled or allowed
persons under her supervision to commingle expired drugs and controlled substances with non-expired
drugs and controlled substances.

20. The expired and non-expired drugs and controlled substances were commingled in an
area where LVCPMC maintained its stock of useable drugs and controlled substances.

21. Between January 1, 2021, and September 2, 2021, Thompson stored or allowed persons
under her supervision to store unlabeled dangerous drugs and/or controlled substances in an area where
LVCPMC maintained its stock of useable drugs and controlled substances. On information and belief,
these dangerous drugs and/or controlled substances were “nonsterile compounded drug products” as
that term is defined at NAC 639.6665.

22. When asked about the unlabeled drugs and/or controlled substances, Thompson could
not identify them or confirm their origin.

23. Between January 1, 2021, and September 2, 2021, Thompson possessed at least 3
prescription blanks that she had signed before filling them out. During the same time frame, Thompson

possessed at least 1 signed prescription that contained no drug information. This supports an inference

that Thompson planned to allow other persons at the LVCPMC, including Smith, to use her name and
credentials to prescribe controlled substances in her absence.

24, As the holder of a certificate of registration issued by the Board, Thompson had a legal
duty to understand and comply with Nevada’s statutes and regulations governing the storage, labeling,
prescribing, and dispensing of dangerous drugs and controlled substances.
