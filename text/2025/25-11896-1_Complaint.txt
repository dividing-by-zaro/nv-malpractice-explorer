4. On August 17, 2019, Patient A underwent in-office sinus surgery by Respondent
which included: bilateral frontal sinuplasty, bilateral maxillary balloon sinuplasty, bilateral
sphenoid balloon sinuplasty; bilateral nasal polypectomy; bilateral intranasal lysis, bilateral
endoscopic submucosal resection of the inferior turbinates, bilateral submucosal resection of nasal
swell bodies, and a lysis of adhesions.

5. Patient A saw Respondent on three (3) occasions between August 20, 2019, and
October 10, 2019, for post-surgical follow-up and endoscopic debridement. Endoscopic findings
noted in the record were unchanged from preoperative notes, with the exception to note that crusts
were debrided.

6. After Patient A’s October 10, 2019, visit, Respondent scheduled surgery on
December 14, 2019, for a second endoscopic sinus surgery.

7. On December 14, 2019, Patient A again underwent sinus surgery by Respondent
which included: bilateral frontal sinus exploration, bilateral maxillary antrostomy and removal of
tissue from the maxillae, bilateral sphenoidotomy, bilateral ethmoidectomy, polypectomy,
bilateral frontal balloon sinuplasty, bilateral maxillary balloon sinuplasty, bilateral swell body
endoscopic resection, spreader graft valve repair, bilateral submucous resection of the inferior
turbinates, septoplasty, and lysis of adhesions.

8. Patient A saw Respondent on four (4) occasions between December 19, 2019, and
February 6, 2020, for post-surgical follow-ups and endoscopic debridement. A repeat CT scan
obtained on February 6, 2020, showed significant sinus disease, with enlarged turbinates, swell
bodies, and a deviated septum, identical to the first CT scan results obtained on August 1, 2019.

9. On May 1, 2020, Patient A underwent sinus surgery by Respondent for a third time
which included: repeat bilateral frontal balloon sinuplasty, repeat bilateral maxillary balloon
sinuplasty, repeat bilateral sphenoid ballon sinuplasty, submucosal resection of the inferior
turbinates, bilateral submucosal resection of the swell bodies. In the operative record, no use of
Merocel packing placement is identified.

10. Patient A saw Respondent on five (5) occasions between May 5, 2020, and July 30,

2020, for additional post-surgical follow-ups and endoscopic debridement. A repeat CT scan

obtained on July 30, 2020, showed a foreign body. The foreign body is not mentioned in the
physician interpretation of the CT, which was identical to the previous two CT scans performed
on August 1, 2019, and February 6, 2020.

11. Respondent’s records for these visits were incomplete, and did not include
evaluations for chronic conditions that would require modification in management or properly
evaluate the etiology of Patient A’s worsening condition.

12. On October 9, 2020, Patient A underwent sinus surgery with a different physician
after seeking a second opinion. During the surgery, a maxillary sinus foreign body was identified,
which was a non-absorbable Merocel sponge from the May 1, 2020, operation.
