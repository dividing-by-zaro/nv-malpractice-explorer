COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Matthew Audet Can, M D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 18925). Respondent was originally
licensed by the Board on May 30, 2019.

2. Patient A? was a fifty-three (53) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. On April 18, 2023, Patient A presented to Respondent, a cardiologist, concerning
Patient A’s history of recurrent atrial fibrillation. After discussion, Patient A elected to undergo
radiofrequency (RF) ablation, wherein catheters would be used to deliver radiofrequency energy to
destroy the heart tissue causing the atrial fibrillation (hereinafter, the “ablation procedure”).

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Chowdhury H. Ahsan, M.D., Ph.D., FACC, Ms.

4. Patient A presented to Renown Regional Medical Center (Renown) on
June 23, 2023, for the ablation procedure, to be performed by Respondent.

5. At approximately 8:00 a m. that day, the attending anesthesiologist induced general
anesthesia with propofol 200mg followed by systemic neuromuscular blockade with rocuronium
60mg. The anesthesiologist intubated Patient A at 8:04 a.m. and placed an ultrasound probe at
8:08 a.m, Throughout the procedure, anesthesia was maintained with repeated administration of}
rocuronium and consistent delivery of inhaled sevoflurane.

6. Throughout the procedure, the anesthesiologist obtained blood pressure readings via
a noninvasive blood pressure cuff every two (2) to three (3) minutes, Respondent also recorded the
systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures as well as Patient A’s heart rate every one (1) to three
(3) minutes.

7. Upon information and belief, Respondent was aware of Patient A’s blood pressure
and heart rate readings during the ablation procedure.

8. Respondent began the surgery at approximately 8:19 a.m. The procedure lasted until
approximately 11 51 a.m.

9. At9:00 a.m., Patient A’s blood pressure ranged between 97/70 mmHg and 126/83
mmHg.

10. During the procedure, Patient A experienced episodes of critically low blood
pressure (hypotension), wherein his blood pressure was lower than 90/60 mmHg. A blood pressure
reading of 70/32 mmHg was recorded at 10:19 am.

11. Patient A further demonstrated blood pressure readings of 77/39 mmHg 10:25 a.m.,
66/33 mmHg at 11:01 a.m., 69/40 mmHg at 11:02 a.m., and 82/57 mmHg at 11:19 a.m.

12, Additionally, between 10:29 a.m. and 11:17 a.m., Patient A demonstrated episodes
of tachycardia, where his heart rate was recorded as over 100 beats per minute, indicating the
potential for significant hypertension.

13. At approximately 10 29 a.m., the anesthesiologist began administering vasoactive
medications in an attempt to treat Patient A’s hypotension episodes. These medications consisted

of intravenous phenylephrine boluses, which were administered at 10:29 a.m., 10:47 a.m., 10:57

1 |} am, and 10:59 a.m,, and a norepinephrine infusion was started at 11 07 a.m. and subsequently
2 |) stopped at 11:51 am.
3 14. However, Patient A continually demonstrated episodes of hypotension throughout
4 |} the remainder of the procedure, as recorded by the blood pressure monitoring, Despite Patient A’s
5 || significant hypotension, which remained uncorrected even with pharmacologic interventions,
6 |] Respondent continued the ablation procedure between 10:19 a.m. and approximately 11:17 a.m.
7 15. Despite the evidence of significant hypotension starting at approximately 10:19 a.m.,
8 |] Respondent did not promptly place an arterial catheter for continuous direct blood pressure
9 || monitoring. This intervention would likely have helped guide further therapy to correct ongoing
10 || severe hypotension in a prompt, timely manner since mitial treatments were unsuccessful, and
11 ]| would likely have helped guide Respondent to emergently cardiovert Patient A for his unstable
12 ]] condition rather than allow Patient A’s blood pressure to remain critically low for one (1) hour.
13 16. Respondent completed the procedure, Patient A was extubated at 11:48 a.m., and
14 ]| norepinephrine was stopped at 1°51 a.m. Patient A was then taken to the post-anesthesia care unit.
15 17. Patient A was then soon after found to be unresponsive and obtunded. A stroke alert
16 || was activated and Patient A required re-intubation to secure his airway. Patient A was then
17]| transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he was followed by neurology and internal
18 || medicine.
19 18. Patient A underwent an MRI of the brain on June 24, 2023, which demonstrated
20 |} ischemic injuries consistent with anoxic bram inyury, i.e. Patient A’s brain was completely deprived
21 || of oxygen. Patient A also demonstrated evidence of organ disruption consistent with hypoperfusion.
2 19. Patient A remamed in the acute care setting at Renown through July 19, 2023.

23 |} Patient A was subsequently transferred to a skilled nursing facility for long-term care,

21 NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

22. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances ”

23. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlned facts, on June 23, 2023,
Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances when rendering medical services to Patient A, by continuing Patient A’s ablation
procedure from approximately 10:19 a.m to 11°17 a.m., despite evidence of significant hypotension
that remained uncorrected, despite pharmacologic interventions, and by not promptly addressing
the significant hypotension. Such failure to address the significant hypotension included, but was
not limited to, failure to (1) promptly place an arterial catheter for continuous direct blood pressure
monitoring; and/or (2) emergently cardiovert Patient A for his unstable condition rather than allow
his blood pressure to remain critically low for one (1) hour.

24, By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early Case
Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been a
violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4, That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this case
as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact, conclusions
of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
