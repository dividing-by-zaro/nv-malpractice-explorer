COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Zia Uddin Khan, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

i Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 8956) Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on April 13, 1999, and has specialties in cardiovascular diseases
and intemal medicine.

2. Patient A? was a sixty-six (66) year-old female when she first presented to
Respondent.

3. Respondent, a cardiologist, initially evaluated Patient A on June 21, 2019, for
discolored feet, chills, and swelling of the foot and ankle. Patient A was noted to have type 2

diabetes. Respondent also diagnosed Patient A with peripheral vascular disease, unspecified.

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authonzed for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Col. Eric D. Wade,
USAF (Ret), and Carl N. Williams, Jr, M D..

2 Patient A's true identity 18 not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but 18 disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint

4. Patient A presented to Respondent at least three (3) times between June 21, 2019,
and June 26, 2020, to address her foot and ankle swelling and the discoloration of her feet, as well
as muscle aches and muscle weakness. Patient A underwent multiple ultrasound tests during this
period, which did not demonstrate significant arterial disease. Patient A also underwent lower
extremity arterial testing on June 9, 2020.

5. On June 26, 2020, Patient A presented to Respondent for a follow-up visit. Patient
A again reported having discoloration of her feet. At this visit, Respondent advised that an
aortogram with possible stenting was necessary to further assess Patient A’s apparent stenosis in
her lower extremities.

6. However, up to this point, from June 21, 2019, to June 26, 2020, Respondent did
not note in Patient A’s medical records any wounds or ulcerations. Respondent's notes from
Patient A’s physical examinations during this time also demonstrated palpable pedal pulses and no
edema.

7. Further, Patient A’s June 9, 2020, test results did not demonstrate significant

elevation of arterial velocities from the common femoral artery through the tibial arteries
bilaterally which would correlate with significant arterial stenosis, necessitating an angiogram.

8. Respondent's notes from June 9, 2020, state that an ankle brachial index (ABI)
ultrasound was unable to be obtained. However, Respondent's notes do not state why an ABI
ultrasound, which is less invasive than an aortogram, could not be obtained.

9. Respondent’s notes from June 9, 2020, further do not mention if he obtained other
non-invasive tests, such as toe brachial indices, which can be helpful for assessing diabetic
patients for peripheral artery disease (PAD), or pedal acceleration times for Patient A.

10. On July 17, 2020, instead of undergoing less mvasive treatment and/or testing,
Patient A underwent an aortogram with bilateral lower extremity angiogram. Patient A then
underwent an angioplasty of the left distal posterior tibial and left lateral plantar arch that same
day.

11. On August 18, 2020, Patient A underwent a right lower extremity aortogram, with
angioplasty of the right distal posterior tibial/plantar arch and right dorsalis pedis and distal
anterior tibial artery.

12. From June 21, 2019, to August 18, 2020, Respondent did not note attempts at less
invasive treatments and/or testing, such as creams or oral calcium blockers to prevent vasospasm,
antiplatelet medications, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors.

13. Patient A later presented to Respondent on September 30, 2020, with complaints of
night lower extremity swelling and right calf pain.

14. On March 9, 2021, Patient A underwent a bilateral venogram, intravascular
ultrasound, and stent and balloon angioplasty of the left common thac vein. On March 30, 2021,
Patient A underwent another bilateral venogram, intravascular ultrasound, and angioplasty of the
left common iliac vein with stenting.

15. Respondent did not note in Patient A’s medical records if Patient A underwent less
invasive testing, such as a computed tomography (CT) venogram or pelvic ultrasound, prior to
undergoing the venous stenting procedures on March 9, 2021, and March 30, 2021

16. Additionally, Patient A at this point had no prior history of left lower extremity
deep vein thrombosis, necessitating a venous stenting procedure.

17 Furthermore, the lesion in Patient A's first venogram from March 9, 2021, was
documented at 40% stenosis. However, greater than 50% stenosis is noted to be the cutoff to
recommend venous stenting.

18. Additionally, on March 9, 2021, Respondent documented a Clinical-Etiology-
Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification of at least four (4) on his indications for the
venous stenting procedure. However, Respondent did not document that Patient A had
hyperpigmentation, eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, healed ulceration, or active ulceration on her
physical exams, indicating a CEAP classification of at least four (4).

19. Patient A also underwent an aortogram with right leg angiogram on March 23,
2021, to ensure no restenosis or thrombosis of the March 9, 2021, angioplasty had occurred.

However, Respondent does not note the performance of a less invasive ABI or ultrasound testing

prior to performing the March 23, 2021, aortogram. Further, Patient A was not noted to have
wounds or rest pain, indicating the need for an aortogram. Patient A’s last recorded ABI from
September 30, 2020, also was noted to be 1.0 bilaterally.

20. Patient A later presented to Respondent in June 2021 for a routine follow-up,
where she still had complaints of swelling and discoloration in her feet. Patient A was then
referred to a rheumatologist for evaluation of vasculttis.
