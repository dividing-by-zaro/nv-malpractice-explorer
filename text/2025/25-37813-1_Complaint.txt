During the procedure, Respondent inadvertently damaged Patient A’s left ureter and post-
operatively failed to discover the injury to the adjacent structure.

5. On June 2, 2023, Patient A presented for her first post-operative visit. Respondent
documented that Patient A denied any issues, and the wound was healing well without any signs
of infection. Following the June 2, 2023, appointment, Patient A called the Respondent’s practice
stating that she was having gas pains, bloating, constipation, and nausea every day since her
surgery.

6. June 29, 2023, Patient A presented for a second post-operative visit with
documented complaints of lower abdominal pain when going to the bathroom, constipation, and
hemorrhoids.

7. On July 17, 2023, Patient A presented to the emergency room with complaints of|
diffuse abdominal pain, bloating, shortness of breath, nausea and pain. A computed tomography
(CT) scan, with and without contrast was obtained. The CT scan demonstrated moderate
abdominal ascites, two (2) small lesions on the liver, and left-sided swelling of the kidney and a
delay in excretion of contrast material from the left kidney. Patient A was admitted to the
hospital, and two (2) paracentesis procedures were performed to remove six (6) liters of fluid.
After this procedure, Patient A noted improvement in her pain.

8. On July 20, 2023, Respondent was consulted on Patient A’s condition. No
evaluation of the patient's kidney or left hydronephrosis or decreased kidney function was
requested, and Patient A was referred to gastroenterology. Respondent failed to diagnose the
injury to Patient A’s left ureter, despite the imaging showing the left renal collecting system
abnormality.

9. Patient A was correctly diagnosed by a hepatologist as having kidney damage
following the injury to her ureter and ultimately required removal of her left kidney.

10. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

11. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

12, NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

13. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A by failing to consider or diagnose injury to Patient A’s:
ureter following the July 17, 2023, CT scan which demonstrated left-sided swelling of the kidney,
and impaired kidney function.

14, By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352

COUNT

NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation —
Failure to Consult

15. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein,

16. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

17. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of |
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

18. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition after July 17, 2023. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care
provider to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition and such a
timely consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and may have enhanced the

quality of medical care provided to Patient A with regard to her impaired kidney function, which

was evident on the July 17, 2023 CT scan.
