that Respondent completed an internship, residency, or fellowship in plastic and/or cosmetic
surgery

4. Atal times relative to this Complaint, Respondent performed liposuction surgery,
an elective cosmetic procedure that is not medically necessary, at Silueta Medspa LLC (Silueta)..

5. Respondent was certified by the American Board of Surgery, which is a member|
Board of the American Board of Medical Specralties (ABMS), with a specialty in surgery and a
subspecialty mn surgical critical care. Respondent's certifications for both general surgery and
surgical critical care, with the ABMS, expired on or about December 31, 2021.

6. Respondent is not certified by any other ABMS Board.

7. The website for Silueta states “{o]ur board-certified plastic surgeons and expert
medical professionals specialize in a range of services, including awake lposuction or general
anesthesia plastic surgeries, facial rejuvenation, body contouring, and minimally invasive
treatments, utilizing state-of-the-art equipment and cutting-edge techniques.” Next to this
statement is a photo of Respondent.

8. Upon information and belief, the website for Silueta does not contam any other
information concerning Respondent, such as information about his credentials.

9. Upon information and belief, Respondent has received training in liposuction
surgery only by way of a twenty-two (22) hour seminar for smart liposuction in November 2014
in Idaho, through the American Society of Cosmetics Physicians.

10. Notwithstanding this limited training and his ABMS Board Certification as a
General Surgeon, Respondent advertises himself as a board-certified plastic surgeon and/or an
expert medical professional.

11, Patient A? was a forty-three (43) year-old female at the time of the events at issue
in this Complaint.

12. Patient A first contacted Silueta in December 2023, via text message, regarding
possible cosmetic improvement of her neck and jawline.

13. Patient A spoke with a staff member at Silueta several times via text message in
December 2023 and January 2024. At one point, Patient A asked if the doctor performing the
service was a plastic surgeon board certified physician. The Silueta staff member responded with
“[y]es, he is a double board-certified and his name is Mirkia, you're more than welcome to meet
him in person if you want.”

14. Patient A presented to Respondent for a consultation on January 20, 2024. An
evaluation form was filled out documenting Respondent’s examination and recommendations.

15. Photos taken of Patient A from on or around this date demonstrated that Patient A
had numerous open wounds and excoriations on her face and severe post-inflammatory
hypopigmented craters on cach cheek, all of which are contraindications to performing surgery.
Specifically, Patient A demonstrated open wounds at the surgical site which is a contraindication
for the procedure, in part because open wounds can lead to a higher chance of post-operative
infection

16. The photos of Patient A taken on or about January 20, 2024, prior to surgery, also
demonstrated possible self-induced facial manipulation and trauma, which again indicated that
Patient A was unsuitable for liposuction surgery, due to possible underlying psychiatric
conditions.

17. However, Respondent on or about January 20, 2024 did not document Patient A’s
open wounds, excoriations, or hyperpigmentation, other than stating “acne scarring.” Based on
Patient A’s photos, Patient A clearly had physical findings more severe than acne scarring,
including evidence of possible self-mutilating practices.

18. Respondent further did not document that he conducted a thorough preoperative
assessment prior to the procedure date to adequately assess Patient A’s medical history and
whether Patient A was an appropriate candidate for liposuction surgery, despite Patient A’s
physical findings requiring a more thorough evaluation and preoperative work-up.
Documentation could have included, but is not limited to, discussion of Patient A’s physical
condition to determine the underlying medical reason for Patient A’s open wounds, excortations,

and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, as well as documentation of discussion of potential
underlying psychiatric conditions involving self-mutilating practices.

19. Upon information and belief, Respondent did not conduct a thorough history and
physical examination of Patient A prior to performing liposuction surgery.

20. Patient A underwent liposuction on January 24, 2024 on her neck and jawline.
Respondent removed 250 cc of lipoaspirate from Patient A’s chin and neck, a larger amount than
needed given Patient A’s presenting condition, indicating over-resection

21. Patient A returned to Silueta on January 25, 2024, with complaints of postoperative
nausea and vomiting. Patient A also voiced concerns about postoperative swelling. Patient A was
reassured that her swelling would improve.

22. Patient A returned to Respondent on January 26, 2024 and February 3, 2024, with
continued complaints of swelling. On February 3, 2024, Respondent recommended Patient A start
lymphatic massage. Patient A completed two (2) of these sessions.

23. On April 3, 2024, Patient A went to the emergency room with complaints of|
swelling, pain, and tightness in her neck. Patient A was found to have incidental hypokalemia
(low potassium) and was told that she was having severe anxiety related to her swelling and
dysphagia.

24. — Patient A presented to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist on June 7, 2024.
The ENT specialist assessed Patient A with likely postsurgical edema and scarring and noted that
he would refer Patient A to a facial plastic surgeon.

25. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

27. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

28. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A because (1) he failed to provide a thorough preoperative
assessment prior to the procedure date to adequately assess Patient A’s medical history and
whether Patient A was an appropriate candidate for liposuction surgery, despite Patient A’s
physical findings requiring a thorough preoperative assessment; and (2) removed 250 ce of
lipoaspirate from Patient A’s chin and neck, a larger amount than needed given Patient A’s
presenting condition.

29. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IH
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

30. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein

31. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

32. Respondent failed to maintain accurate medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment, and care of Patient A, specifically because he failed to document a thorough
preoperative assessment prior to the procedure date to adequately assess Patient A’s medical
history and whether Patient A was an appropriate candidate for liposuction surgery. This
includes, but 1s not limited to, the fact that Respondent only noted “acne scarring” in the intake
form, even though Patient A clearly had physical findings more severe than acne scarring.
Therefore, Respondent's medical records relating to Patient A were not timely, legible, accurate,

and complete.

33. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
COUNT II
NRS 630.306(1)(e) - Practice Beyond Scope of License

34. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

35.  NRS 630.306(1)(e) provides that practicing or offering to practice beyond the
scope permitted by law or performing services which the licensee knows or has reason to know
that he or she is not competent to perform, or which are beyond the scope of his or her training
constitutes grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

36. As demonstrated by, but not limited to the above-outlined facts, Respondent is not,
and has never been, a board-certified plastic surgeon and has only received instruction in cosmetic
surgery from a seminar in 2014. Therefore, Respondent lacks the requisite and proper trainmg in
plastic and cosmetic surgery to perform liposuction surgery.

37 By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IV
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation —
False, Deceptive, or Misleading Advertising

38. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

39. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board 1s grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

40. NAC 630.190(1)(e) provides that a licensee shall not advertise m such a manner
that the advertising includes any statement which is known to be false, or through the exercise of,
reasonable care should be known to be false, deceptive, misleading or harmful, in order to induce
any person to purchase, utilize or acquire any professional services or to enter into any obligation

or transaction relating thereto.

u

41. NAC 630.190(1)(g) provides that a licensee shall not advertise in such a manner
that the advertising is false, deceptive or misleading in regard to services performed or to be
performed

42. NAC. 630.190(2) states that it is sufficient for disciplinary purposes that any
statement or other advertising described in paragraph (e), (f) or (g) of subsection 1 has a tendency
to: (a) Deceive, mislead or harm the public because of its false, deceptive, misleading or harmful
character, or (b) Produce unrealistic expectations in particular cases, even though no member of
the public 1s actually deceived, misled or harmed, or no unrealistic expectations are actually
produced by the statement or other advertising.

43. The Silueta website advertises Respondent as a board-certified plastic surgeon
and/or medical professional who “specialize{s] in a range of services, including awake liposuction
or general anesthesia plastic surgeries, facial rejuvenation, body contouring, and minimally
invasive treatments, utilrzing state-of-the-art equipment and cutting-edge techniques.”

44. Further, an employee of Silutea represented to Patient A in December 2023 that
Respondent was a double board-certified plastic surgeon, after Patient A specifically asked if the
doctor performing liposuction surgery was a plastic surgeon board certified physician.

45. However, Respondent 1s not a board-certified plastic surgeon and only completed a
twenty-two (22) hour seminar in 2014 on liposuction surgery.

46. Thus, Respondent advertised himself in a manner that included statements which
were known to be false, or through the exercise of reasonable care should be known to be false,
deceptive, misleading or harmful, in order to induce Patient A to utilize his professional services.

47. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;
