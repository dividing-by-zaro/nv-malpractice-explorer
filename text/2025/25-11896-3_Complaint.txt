4, Respondent performed an endoscopy, and diagnosed Patient A with headache,
nasal fracture, nasal deformity, and epistaxis (bleeding from inside nose), and recommended the
use of saline gel for her symptoms.

5. On April 30, 2019, Patient A again presented to Respondent following a second fall
resulting in a fractured nose. Respondent's physical exam notes of findings and Patient A’s nasal
endoscopy findings were identical. A CT scan of Patient A’s sinuses was obtained and was
reported as significant sinus disease with very enlarged turbinates, a deviated septum, and large
swell bodies, however the CT scan did not demonstrate severe sinus disease.

6. Respondent documented that Patient A had tried antibiotics and over-the-counter
allergy medications but failed to document what types of antibiotics at which dosages, and what
type of allergy medications were used. Additionally, Respondent failed to note what, if any,
prescription medications Patient A was taking in the preoperative record. Instead of pursuing
conservative measures or attempting to treat Patient A’s sinus issues with antibiotics and steroids,
Respondent scheduled Patient A for an elective nose surgery and sinus surgery on May 29, 2019.

7. On May 29, 2019, Patient A underwent extensive surgery including balloon
sinuplasty of the bilateral frontal, maxillary, and sphenoid sinuses, septoplasty, rhinoplasty,
bilateral submucosal resection of inferior turbinates and swell bodies.

8. Following the May 29, 2019, surgery, Patient A experienced significant bleeding
and required repeated hospitalizations
