5. Patient A was then seen by a different doctor at Swift Institute beginning January 31,
2023, for his left arm pain, hand pain, and this physician performed spinal surgery for Patient A.

6. Areferral to Respondent was given by the spinal surgeon for a surgical consultation
of Patient A’s left-hand injury after several non-surgical options for his left hand were explored
without successful pain relief.

7. On May 25, 2023, Patient A saw Respondent, this time, at Swift Institute where
Respondent was now employed. Respondent reviewed his physical exam findings and discussed
treatment options, to which Patient A opted for a partial amputation of his left ring finger.

8 On June 12, 2023, Patient A presented for partial amputation of his left ring finger

9. Respondent drew out the surgical incision on the left ring finger and confirmed with
Patient A the location of the amputation.

10. Patient A was then taken to the operating room where he was placed in a supine
position and given general endotracheal anesthesia

11 Respondent performed a time-out with all those in attendance in the operating room,
confirming the proper surgical site and surgery to be performed

12. Patient A’s hand was positioned palm up during the time-out. Respondent then
tumed the hand over to the face down position and redrew the surgical incision markings because
he believed the first markings had faded.

13. Respondent then performed a partial amputation of Patient A’s left middle finger
instead of removing part of his left ring finger, resulting in a wrong-site surgery on the left hand.

14. Once Respondent realized his error, he then consulted Patient A’s wife who called
their daughter to discuss what happened. Patient A's family consented for Respondent to continue
with the partial amputation of the correct left ring finger.

15. Respondent then performed the partial amputation of Patient A’s left ring finger, the
correct finger.
