4, The operative report from the EGD surgery notes that Patient A had a diagnosed
umbilical/ventral hernia and that the omentum incarcerated in this chronic hernia was transected
and left filling the umbilical hernia defect.

5. During the EGD gastric bypass surgery, the hernia was not repaired and the surgery
was completed without complication. Patient A was discharged home on the day after surgery,
March 26, 2024.

6. On March 29, 2024, Patient A had a follow-up visit with the lead surgeon, and
appeared to be recovering reasonably well.

7. On or about March 30, 2024, Patient A was feeling ill, and presented to the
emergency room at Mountain View Hospital (MVH) on March 30, 2024.

8. A workup was performed at MVH which led to a diagnosis of acute small bowel
obstruction from an incarcerated ventral hernia

9. Patient A was transferred to the emergency department at Southern Hills Hospital
(SHH) where her surgeon of record for her EGD gastric bypass surgery had privileges. Her lead
surgeon of record was out of town, and Respondent was covering his patients.

10. The CT report from MVH emergency department said, “[pJostoperative changes of |
recent gastric bypass. [T]he excluded stomach is markedly distended with fluid. Proximal and mid
small bowel distended with gas fluid levels, measuring up to 5.7 em. Small bowel is dilated to level
of large ventral hernia containing fat and mildly distended small bowel. Small bowel distal to this
hernia is decompressed. The colon is decompressed. Esophagus distended with fluid. Impression:
1, Small bowel obstruction at the level of large periumbilical hernia containing fat and bowel.”

11. The CT images from the emergency department of MVH showed a high-grade bowel
obstruction distal to the jejunojejunostomy from an incarcerated ventral hernia with fluid build-up
and dilation of both limbs of the bypass, the gastric remnant, and into the esophagus.

12. Though Patient A’s laboratory results were relatively normal, she was tachycardic.

13. Patient A was admitted into the intermediate care unit at SHH, where Respondent
assumed care at or about 9:58 p.m. on March 30, 2024, and saw Patient A at or about 7:24 a.m. on
March 31, 2024,

14. Respondent wrote a history and physical note that nausea and tachycardia are
common after EGD bypass surgery.

15. Respondent’s history and physical note described a heart rate of 146 bpm and an
umbilical hernia with mild erythema. His note also reported that an upper gastrointestinal X-ray
“UGI and repeat CT scans do not show a leak.”

16, Respondent's final assessment was “[gJastric bypass” with plans to start additional
medications and stool softeners.

17. Atsome point in the early afternoon on March 31, 2024, Patient A vomited, aspirated
and suffered a cardiac arrest. She received CPR, intubation, central lines, max vasopressor and
ventilatory support, but unfortunately could not be resuscitated and died.

18. Respondent saw Patient A prior to her death at approximately 1:00 p.m. on
March 31, 2024, and his progress note stated, “Pt vomited and aspirated. Cardiac Arrest. Down

with 6 rounds before return of vitals. Intubated. NGT [nasogastric tube] removed 2 L of bilious
fluid...”

19 There is no indication in the medical records of Patient A that Respondent reviewed
the CT scan from MVH, where the radiologist’s report stated that there was a ventral hemia with
incarcerated bowel and fat with obstruction.

20. Respondent's history and physical note suggests that he felt the CT report to be
incorrect.

24. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
treating Patient A when Respondent failed to conduct a careful and thorough review of the available
imaging, failed to perform a timely bedside evaluation of Patient A, and rather than perform an
immediate surgical intervention on the acute small bowel obstruction, Respondent instead ordered
more medications and stool softener for Patient A.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give

Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been a
violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this case
as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact, conclusions
of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
