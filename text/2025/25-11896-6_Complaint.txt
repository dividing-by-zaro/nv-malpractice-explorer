Respondent.

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),
by and through Ian J. Cumings, Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Vincent Peter Nalbone, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of

left and 90% on the right with inferior turbinate hypertrophy. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan
was performed, but did not show the septal deviation nor inferior turbinates, with the findings
documented as “sinus disease present consistent with clinical presentation.” Oral steroids and an
antibiotic were prescribed by Respondent to Patient A.

4. Patient A was seen again on June 9, 2022, with minimal relief from the antibiotics,
but he had regained some smell with the steroids. Respondent discussed surgical options with

Patient A, and scheduled surgery for Patient A on June 22, 2022.

5S. On June 22, 2022, Respondent performed surgery on Patient A including: bilateral

frontal balloon sinuplasty, bilateral maxillary balloon antrum dilation, bilateral sphenoid balloon
sinus dilation and bilateral ethmoidectomy with polypectomy and bilateral interior turbinate
reduction.

6. On June 27, 2022, Respondent saw Patient A for a post-surgical follow-up. Patient
A reported no change in his symptoms and Respondent performed an endoscopic debridement for
Patient A, and scheduled a follow-up visit for two (2) weeks later.

7. On July 11, 2022, Patient A returned reporting a constant migraine for the prior two
(2) weeks. Patient A reported better breathing at times but continued to experience nose bleeds with
blowing and yellow colored drainage. Respondent performed another endoscopic debridement,
provided a prescription for antibiotics, and instructed Patient A to follow-up in two (2) weeks

8. On July 25, 2022, Respondent saw Patient A for a third post-operative appointment,
and documented Patient A experienced some improvement with the antibiotics but still continued
to experience the same symptoms. Respondent prescribed Clindamycin and requested Patient A
follow-up in two (2) weeks.

9. On August 5, 2022, Respondent obtained a post-operative CT scan of Patient A
which did not demonstrate improvement when compared to the May 26, 2022, CT scan. The scan
demonstrated severe maxillary and ethmoidal inflammation, which was slightly worse than the
preoperative CT, with worsening of the left-side sphenoid disease, and showed left inferior turbinate
enlargement which is evidence that the ethmoidectomy was incomplete. The ostia did not appear

to be dilated significantly. Further, there were no signs of polyps in the earlier CT scan, but the

medical records for Patient A authored by Respondent note a polypectomy. Lastly, the
postoperative left inferior turbinate is actually larger, and the right side is unchanged.

10. On August 15, 2022, Patient A was seen for a post-surgical nasal endoscopy.
Respondent documented that significant sinus disease continues to be present, Patient A’s turbinates
were very enlarged, he had a deviated septum and enlarged swell bodies.
