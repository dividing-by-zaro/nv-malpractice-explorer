5. On June 1, 2021, during Patient A’s follow-up visit, Respondent documented
Patient A as having no significant improvement with antihistamines and steroids. Patient A
underwent a Computed Tomography (CT) scan which showed “significant disease” and was
scheduled for a balloon sinuplasty, septoplasty, along with a turbinate and swell body reduction
(“Surgery”).

8:47 a.m., Patient A was given 10 mg of Valium, a benzodiazepine, and 1 mg of Xanax, a fast-
acting benzodiazepine. Following this dose of benzodiazepines, Patient A began to experience a
bad reaction to the medications. Approximately thirty (30) minutes after the first dose of
benzodiazepines at 9:22 a.m., Patient A was given a second dose of 10 mg of Valium, and | mg of |
Xanax. Approximately one (1) hour after the first dose of benzodiazepines, Patient A was given a
third dose of 10 mg of Valium, and 1 mg of Xanax. At 10:11 a.m. Patient A was noted to have
had violent movements upon attempted insertion of cotton into the nasal cavity and was given a
fourth dose of 10 mg of Valium, and 1 mg of Xanax. At this time, the total amount of|
benzodiazepines given to Patient A, within an hour and a half, was 40 mg of Vahum and 4 mg of]
Xanax. Patient A began showing signs of benzodiazepine overdose and a negative reaction. After
the final dose of benzodiazepines, Respondent performed the Surgery on Patient A and completed
the operation at 11:20 a.m.

7. After the Surgery, at 11:26 am. and again at 11:46 am., Patient A was
