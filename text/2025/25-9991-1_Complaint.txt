In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 25-9991-1

Against: FI LE D

MITCHELL FADOUL KEAMY, M.D., MAR 12 2025

Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

MEDICAL EXAMINE,
By:

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Alexander J. Hinman, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Mitchell Fadoul Keamy, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1, Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 5653). Respondent was originally
licensed by the Board on June 11, 1988, with a specialty in anesthesiology and a subspecialty in
critical care medicine.

2. Patient A? was a seventy-five (75) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. On October 26, 2022, Patient A was admitted to Spring Valley Medical Center for
abdominal pain and bloating. Patient A was diagnosed with a small bowel obstruction (SBO)
related to adhesions from prior abdominal surgeries.


' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Aury Nagy, M.D., Nick M. Spirtos, M.D.,
F.A.C.O.G., and Ms. Maggie Arias-Petrel.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4, Patient A was initially treated with non-operative medical management for his
SBO, which consisted of no food or water by mouth and nasogastric (NG) tube decompression.

5. On October 28, 2022, it was believed that Patient A’s condition was improving and
as a result, he was started on a liquid diet. Documentation shows that the NG tube was removed
as well.

6. On October 29, 2022, at approximately 8:00 a.m., Patient A’s abdomen re-
distended and it was decided by his surgeon to do an exploratory surgery of the abdomen to
relieve the cause of his SBO. His liquid diet was then discontinued and changed to nil per os
(nothing by mouth) for surgery later in the evening.

7. On October 29, 2022, Patient A was brought to the operating room for surgery at
4:48 p.m., and at 5:03 p.m., Patient A was given general anesthesia, approximately nine (9) hours
after it had been decided to re-explore Patient A.

8. Respondent was the acting anesthesiologist in Patient A’s care during the surgery.

9. After the induction of anesthesia, Patient A aspirated a large volume of liquid
contents. This occurred as a likely result of not evacuating Patient A’s stomach contents and
failing to place an NG tube for gastric decompression before the induction of anesthesia.

10. Patient A was subsequently intubated successfully, but he had _ significant
hemodynamic disturbances during the surgery, including hypotension and arrythmias.

11. Surgery was completed and Patient A was taken to the intensive care unit at
6:25 p.m., for further workup and management while still intubated. He was found to have
suffered a myocardial infarction as documented on a post-operative electrocardiogram (ECG), as
well as continued hypotension, runs of supra ventricular tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation.
Additionally, Patient A had substantial difficulty maintaining adequate oxygen saturations while
on the ventilator.

12. Respondent called for an immediate cardiology consult and the cardiologist felt
that any intervention would be contraindicated because of the recent laparotomy. The cardiologist
attempted cardioversion, however that attempt was unsuccessful.

13. On October 30, 2022, Patient A’s family withdrew care of Patient A at 8:40 p.m.,

and he expired shortly thereafter.
COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

14. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

15. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

16. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

17. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A when he induced anesthesia without confirming adequate
gastric decompression in Patient A with a known small bowel obstruction and continued
abdominal distension. Further, an NG tube was not placed in the nine (9) hour interval prior to
surgery and it is unclear why this was not ordered by Respondent once he knew that he was going
to be the anesthesiologist for Patient A’s surgery. This basic and low risk maneuver likely could
have reduced the risk of aspiration in Patient A and enhanced the care and treatment of Patient A.

18. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

19. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

20.  NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute

grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

15,

21. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document his actions when he treated
Patient A, where, among other things, he failed to document a medical rationale for why an NG
tube was not placed before the induction of anesthesia. As a result, Patient A’s medical records
were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

22. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and

premises.
