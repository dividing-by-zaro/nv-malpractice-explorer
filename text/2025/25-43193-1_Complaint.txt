and supplements, such as Vitamin BS, B6, B12, L-Arginine, Glutathione, and Magnesium
Chloride, as well as medications commonly used to treat pain such as Toradol, which increases the
risk of heart attack and stroke if the patient has a heart condition. Lastly, the nausea medication,
Ondansetron was often included in the IV therapy services provided, which 1s also contraindicated
in patients with certain heart conditions or electrolyte imbalances

6. These medications were provided with frequency and without a clear
understanding of who all received which ones, and what history was taken from the patients
before the infusions.

7. On July 6, 2023, a joint site inspection was conducted by the Board and the Nevada
State Board of Pharmacy (Pharmacy Board) in response to a complaint alleging unsafe and
unsanitary practices at Prime IV’s Discovery Drive location.

8 During the onsite inspection, it was discovered that no primary-level practitioners
were present at the facility. Dangerous drugs were being administered to patients without prior’
practitioner evaluation, diagnosis or visit and without a documented medical necessity, chart
order, or prescription. The records further indicated that these drugs were being administered to
patients without any telemedicine consultation or practitioner consult, Additionally, chart orders
were being signed afier the administration of the dangerous drugs It was also noted that these
medications were being stored in a refrigerator alongside food items, in violation of proper storage
protocols. Lastly, Magnesium Chloride was frequently administered to numerous patients, often
without a clear record of who received the treatment or what medical history was obtained prior to
the infusions.

9. On February 27, 2024, the Pharmacy Board filed a Notice of Intended Action and
Accusation (Accusation), attached hereto as Exhibit 1. In pertinent part, the Pharmacy Board
Accusation alleged that Respondent permitted various individuals to independently access,
possess and administer dangerous drugs to patients to provide on-site medical treatment at Prime
TV, without direct supervision and to patients with whom Respondent had not diagnosed or

determined medical necessity.
