Medical Practice Act).

1. Respondent is a medical doctor currently licensed in the State of Nevada by the
Board in active-probation status (License No. 10476) since October 2, 2023, pursuant to the
provisions of NRS Chapter 630. Respondent was originally licensed by the Board on

Care of Patient A?
2. At the time of the events in this Complaint, Patient A was a 27-year old female.
3. On July 11, 2022, Patient A saw Respondent as a new patient for an annual

gynecologic examination, pap smear, STD screening, and to discuss birth control.

4. In her visit with Respondent while discussing birth control options, Patient A
describes that Respondent repeatedly used the word “jizzing” and made other comments regarding

his own sexual history and childhood that made Patient A uncomfortable.

5. Upon information and belief, a chaperone was not present during these
conversations.
6. Following this conversation, Respondent performed a breast examination, pelvic

examination, and pap smear of Patient A.

7. According to Patient A’s records, a chaperone was present during Respondent’s
examination of Patient A.

8. However, Patient A reported feeling uncomfortable with the way that Respondent
performed these examinations.

9. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that physical
examinations should be “explained appropriately, undertaken only with the patient’s consent, and
performed with the minimum amount of physical contact required to obtain data for diagnosis and
treatment.”?

10. Upon information and belief, Respondent should have provided more explanation
to Patient A regarding these examinations.

11. Upon information and belief, Patient A perceived that the examinations included
touches by Respondent that were of a longer length or different depth of pressure than what
Patient A was used to or comfortable with.

12. Patient A further indicated that Respondent gave her a prescription for birth control
and told her she could use a secret back-office phone number to call him when she returned for
her birth control injection and that she could enter the office through a secret VIP back entrance.

13. Patient A received a call from Respondent regarding her abnormal pap smear
results, and Respondent recommended that she return for a follow up visit to receive further
treatment.

Communications with Patients D° and E7

42. Prior to January 2023, Patients D and E were patients of Respondent.

43. On January 6, 2023, Patient D sent an email to the Board regarding a text message
that she received from Respondent.

44. On January 6, 2023, Patient E sent an email to the Board regarding a text message
that she received from Respondent.

45. Upon information and belief, this same text message was sent to multiple current
and/or former patients of Respondent.

46. In this text message, Respondent asked Patients D and E to lend him money in

47. Respondent indicated that he needed this money to defend against a disciplinary
action brought by the Board against him.

48. Respondent indicated that his finances were depleted after a “nasty divorce”

a

52. However, Respondent further indicated that, after speaking with his attorney, he
was advised that he should not have asked his current and/or former patients for money.

53. Respondent indicated that he refunded the money he received and did not accept
any other loans that were subsequently sent to him by current and/or former patients.

54.  Beneficence is one of the most important ethical principles in the doctor-patient
relationship.

55. The solicitation of money from a current patient or former patient ignores the
fiduciary responsibility of the physician and places the physician’s financial gain above the best
interests of the patient.

56. This can diminish the trust in the physician and the medical community as a whole,
and can create a relationship in which the physician may no longer be able to remain objective in
his interactions with the patient.

57. Sending this text message to his current and/or former patients is evidence that
Respondent’s boundaries with his patients are lacking.

58. Respondent, as a medical doctor in the State of Nevada, knew or should have
known that seeking monetary loans from his patients was improper.

Care of Patient E

59. At the time of the events in this Complaint, Patient E was a forty-four (44) year old
female.

60. For Patient E, Respondent provided only handwritten medical records.

61. These records appear incomplete and/or illegible.

62. Upon information and belief, handwritten medical records do not meet the standard
of care for medical records.

63. Upon information and belief, Respondent’s records for Patient E are not timely,
legible, accurate, and complete.

Care of Patient F®

64. From 2016 to 2020, Patient F was a patient of Respondent.

65. At the time of the events in this Complaint, Patient E was a thirty (30) year old to
thirty-four (34) year old female.

66. In 2016, Patient F went to see Respondent about a sexual issue she was having with
her husband.

67. Patient F stated that during her pelvic examination at that visit, Respondent inserted
one finger inside of her vagina and asked her to squeeze.

feel that.

69. Patient F stated that Respondent then inserted two fingers inside of her vagina and
asked her to squeeze again.

70. Respondent then asked again if she felt that, and she said “yes.”

71. Patient F reported that Respondent then used crude terms to say that the sexual
issue was the fault of her husband.

72. Respondent then asked Patient F if he could take pictures of her vagina for his
other business because her vagina would look good in his advertisements.

73. Patient F declined and did not return to see Respondent for any further medical
care.

74. Upon information and belief, Respondent failed to explain the purpose of the Kegel
examination that he conducted with Patient F and he failed to obtain Patient F’s consent for such
an examination.

75. Accordingly, Respondent’s care of Patient F fell below the standard of care.

76. Further, it was improper for Respondent to ask Patient F to pose for nude
photographs.
