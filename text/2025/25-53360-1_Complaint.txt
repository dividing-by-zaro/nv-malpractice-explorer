= Patient A was five foot eleven inches (5°11) and had a weight of three hundred
and fifty-two pounds (352lbs) with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of forty-nine point one (49.1) at the
time of presentation.

4. On October 1, 2020, Patient A underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram revealing
a normal left ventricular function, an ejection fraction of sixty to sixty-five percent (60-65%), a
normal right atrium and left ventricle, a normal pulmonary artery, and IVC was normal with
respiratory variation.

5. On October 2, 2020, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) demonstrated a Hill
grade 3 hiatal hernia and gastritis. Biopsies of the gastritis were performed and the pathology
demonstrated mild chronic superficial gastritis.

6. On October 5, 2020, the Respondent performed a paraesophageal hiatal hernia
repair, an EGD, and a sleeve gastrectomy on Patient A.

7. Imhis surgical notes, Respondent describes a large hiatal hernia repaired with three
(3) posterior stitches,

8 Upon completion of the surgery, Patient A was transferred to the recovery room
and given IV fluids, anti-emetics, and pain medication.

9. On October 6, 2020, Patient was found to be intolerant of oral intake to the point he
could not ingest his own saliva. Respondent elected to take Patient A back to surgery to perform a
diagnostic laparoscopy and noted that he discovered the hiatal repair appeared to be too tight.

10. In Respondent's October 6, 2020, operative note, (dated October 5, 2020, in an
apparent error as that was the date of the first surgery), he states that he cut and removed the
anterior most stich of the hiatal repair, and that the subsequent endoscope passed through the
hiatus “more easily”. Further, he states that “no fluid, inflammation, purulence, or leakage was
seen in any of the previously operated areas.”

11 After the diagnostic laparoscopy, Patient A was taken to the recovery room where
he appeared to recover uneventfully and was discharged from the facility.

12. On October 7, 2020, and October 8, 2020, Patient A was seen in follow-up at
Blossom Medical Group. Patient A’s oral intake was still poor, and he was given IV fluid
resuscitation on each visit.

13. On October 8, 2020, Patient A was reported as being very intolerant of oral fluids,
getting in zero (0) ounces of water and zero (0) grams of protein. Further, the note from the visit
reads, “per Rogers, call ambulance transfer to Henderson hospital.”

14, On presentation to the Henderson Hospital on October 8, 2020, Patient A was
complaining of left upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. His vital signs showed
he was tachycardic with a heart rate of 107, and laboratory evaluation revealed an elevated white
blood cell count.

15. On October 8, 2020, while at Henderson Hospital, Patient A underwent a CT scan
with IV contrast, which revealed that he was developing pneumonia and significant emesis.

16. On October 9, 2020, Patient A was discharged from the hospital with a handwritten
discharge summary stating that he was “tolerating [the] diet”.

17. On October 10, 2020, Patient A was seen at Blossom Medical Group, and
complained of dehydration, stating that he was not tolerating oral vitamin supplements He was
given dietary recommendations and instructed to develop a routine exercise program.

18. On October 11, 2020, Patient A was brought to the Saint Rose Siena emergency
department by Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Notes from this incident describe that Patient
A was experiencing an acute onset of chest pressure and pleuritic type chest pain and was in
severe respiratory distress. The EMS providers reported that his oxygen saturations were low at
the time of their arrival, and he was transported to the hospital on a non-rebreather mask.

19. Patient A was tachycardic with a heart rate of 138 and the ER physician moved to
intubate him for stabilization. During the intubation, Patient A sustained a cardiac arrest and
CPR/ACLS measures were initiated. Patient A retumed to spontaneous circulation after
approximately twelve (12) minutes of CPR.

20. Patient A was subsequently placed on a mechanical ventilator for respiratory
support and started on vasopressors. The emergency room workup revealed that Patient A had
severe mixed acidosis with an elevated creatine level, and he was not producing any urine.

21. An EKG performed at Patient A’s bedside showed a strained right ventricle with a
McConnell sign (a specific echocardiographic finding that strongly suggests acute pulmonary
embolism). He was then given a Tissue Plasminogen Activator and given Heparin (an
anticoagulant to prevent blood clots).

22. ACTA of Patient A’s chest with IV contrast and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis
with IV contrast revealed possible pneumonia, moderate to large pneumoperitoneum, and
extensive pneumatosis. Further, he had a six (6) centimeter fluid collection posterior to the gastric
sleeve.

23. Under Respondent's directive, Patient A’s imaging consisted of a water-soluble
contrast of upper GI and a CT scan without oral contrast. Despite Patient A having suspected
leaks following sleeve gastrectomy, a CT scan with oral contrast was not ordered which would
have allowed for a more comprehensive assessment of the post-surgical anatomy.

24. Patient A was subsequently admitted to the ICU for monitoring. Over the next
twenty-four (24) hours, Patient A’s urine output and renal function worsened, and a hemodialysis
catheter was emergently placed for Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT). Patient A was in severe
shock during this time.

25. On October 12, 2020, Patient A became more stable, and another physician took
Patient A to the operating room to perform diagnostic laparoscopy, debridement, and drainage of
intra-abdominal abscesses with placement of three (3) JP drains,

26. __ In the surgeon's October 12, 2020, operative report, the surgeon describes “all four
quadrants containing enteric looking abscess fluid, about 2 1/2 liters of fluid was removed.” He
describes, “the remnant of the gastric sleeve to be socked in with fibrinous exudate and states that
it was not safe to proceed with further dissection.” Thus, a decision was made to leave the three
(3) JP drains in place.

27. Patient A’s condition over the ensuing hospitalization did not improve and on the
morning of October 16, 2020, a clinical exam was suggestive of brain death. Due to this finding,
Patient A was extubated and expired
