COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attomey for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Karl Brian Romaneschi, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 7827). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on June 18, 1996. Respondent is certified by the American Board

of Otolaryngology.

2. Patient A? was a fifty-one (51) year-old female at the time of the events at issue in
this Complaint.
3. Patient A presented to Respondent on February 7, 2023, with complaints of a

painful bump, or lesion, under the right side of her tongue. Respondent recommended an

excisional biopsy to distinguish between possible early cancer or a benign lesion.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Aury Nagy, M.D., Ms. Maggie Arias-Petrel,
and Nick M Spirtos, M.D., F.A.C.0.G.

Patient A's true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient

4. On March 2, 2023, Respondent performed, in his office, an excision of sample
lesion tissue on the right side of Patient A’s tongue for the purpose of a biopsy. Respondent then
sent the specimen for a pathology evaluation.

5. There is no indication in Patient A’s medical records that Respondent obtained
informed consent from Patient A, either written or verbal, prior to performing the March 2, 2023,
excision biopsy.

6. On March 7, 2023, Respondent received a pathology report from the specimen
taken from Patient A. The pathology report described the specimen as “tongue, right inferior
tongue.” This report further included a final diagnosis of the tongue lesion, indicating “positive for
malignancy,” and “ulcerated, invasive, poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma,” as well as
“[iJnvasive carcinoma is present at the peripheral and deep margin of several sections.”

7. On March 9, 2023, Patient A returned to Respondent's office for a biopsy follow-
up. Respondent recommended a “te-resection of the lesion” Upon information and belief, the
purpose of a “re-resection” was to remove the remaining squamous cell carcinoma still present in
the original biopsy site, 1.¢., the right-sided tongue lesion.

8. Patient A then signed a “Consent for Surgical Procedure” form on March 9, 2023,

authorizing Respondent to perform surgery on the “exterior lesion of tongue.” However, this form
did not mention the location of Patient A’s lesion on the tongue.

9. On April 19, 2023, Patient A presented to the surgery center for a resection, or re-
resection, of the original biopsy site, to be performed by Respondent.

10. Patient A’s medical records do not indicate that Respondent performed a detailed
preoperative examination of Patient A prior to the procedure on April 19, 2023. Further, there is
no documentation in Patient A’s medical records to indicate that Respondent addressed the
laterality of the surgery, or otherwise specified which side of the tongue the procedure was to be
performed.

Il. Additionally, Patient A’s medical records do not indicate that Respondent
addressed the “correct side” of the tongue during a pre-surgery timeout.

12, In his operative notes from April 19, 2023, Respondent acknowledged Patient A’s
recent medical history, noting that Patient A “was resected with an excisional biopsy, but margins
were positive. The patient was therefore interested in re-excising the original tract.” Respondent
further noted that “[a] fusiform excision along the prior incision Ine was carried out and
removed,” and that he “harvested anterolateral, anteromedial, posteromedial, posterolateral, and
deep margins and sent those for frozen section and they came back negative.”

13. Upon information and belief, at the April 19, 2023, procedure, Respondent
performed an excision and removed tissue on the left side of Patient A’s tongue. Conversely,
Respondent did not perform a surgical excision of any portion of the tongue’s right side, the side
Respondent had previously been discussed with Patient A, that was previously biopsied, and the
side confirmed to have malignant squamous cell carcinoma.

14. Respondent's notes from the April 19, 2023, surgery further do not mention a
lesion on the left side of Patient A’s tongue or otherwise indicate the need for excision of the left
side of the tongue.

15. On April 26, 2023, Patient A returned to Respondent for a postoperative
appointment. In his notes, Respondent noted that Patient A “had excision of mouth lesion on
4/19/23.” Respondent's notes indicated that the “surgical site healing well no sign of persistent
lesion. Patient to call next week for path. I want to follow he[r] monthly to check for recurrence.”
Respondent’s notes from this appointment did not document which side Respondent had
performed the excision, or that Respondent did not perform an excision on the right side of Patient
A's tongue.

16. Respondent's notes from April 26, 2023, further made no mention of addressimg
the right-side squamous cell carcinoma, such as scheduling Patient A for an additional procedure.

17, After this appointment, Patient A sought medical care elsewhere.
On May 16, 2023, Patient A presented to a physician at Stanford Health Care to address the
‘squamous cell carcinoma. The physician noted that Patient A had squamous cell carcinoma on the
right side of her tongue, and the excision performed on April 19, 2023, was completed on the

contralateral side.

18. On May 25, 2023, the Stanford Multidisciplinary Head and Neck Tumor Board met
to discuss Patient A’s case and recommended a partial glossectomy to remove the original biopsy
site that had positive margins.

19. On June 13, 2023, Patient A underwent a partial right glossectomy at Stanford to
exercise the original biopsy site located on the right side of Patient A’s tongue.

20. A final pathology report from the June 13, 2023, surgery was sent to Stanford,
demonstrating no residual cancer on the right side of Patient A’s tongue.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

21. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

22. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

23. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

24. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A because he failed to (1) perform a re-excision of
Patient A’s right-sided tongue lesion, on or after April 19, 2023, that was previously shown by
pathology to be an incompletely excised squamous cell carcinoma; and (2) address,
‘on April 26, 2023, the incompletely excised squamous cell carcinoma present on the right side of |
Patient A’s tongue, such as recommending additional treatment to Patient A, thereby leaving
Patient A’s residual carcinoma unexcised and untreated.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630 352.

COUNT I
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Proper Medical Records

26. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

27. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to mamtain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

28 Respondent failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment, and care of Patient A, specifically because he failed to (1) document
informed consent from Patient A prior to the March 2, 2023, excision biopsy; (2) document the
location of the lesion in the consent form for the April 19, 2023, procedure; (3) document a
detailed preoperative examination of Patient A prior to the April 19, 2023, procedure; (4)
document that he participated in a pre-surgery “time out” on April 19, 2023, to confirm the
location of the lesion; (5) document pre-operatively which side of the tongue the procedure was to
be performed on April 19, 2023; (6) document which side of Patient A’s tongue Respondent
actually performed the excision on
April 19, 2023; (7) document on April 26, 2023, that Respondent did not perform a re-excision on
the right side of Patient A’s tongue; and (8) document on or after April 26, 2023, that Respondent
scheduled Patient A for an additional procedure to treat the squamous cell carcinoma on the right
side of Patient A’s tongue. Therefore, Respondent's medical records relating to Patient A were
not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

29. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give

him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in

NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;
