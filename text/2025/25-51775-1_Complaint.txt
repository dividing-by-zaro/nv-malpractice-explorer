4, On March 18, 2021, Respondent performed a Brazilian butt lift with liposuction on
Patient A.

5. On March 19, 2021, Patient A returned to see Respondent and was noted to have a
normal postoperative exam.

6. Following the March 19, 2021, post-operative exam, Patient A began to experience
pain with a burning sensation at the surgical site, along with skin discoloration.

7. On March 22, 2021, Patient A was re-evaluated for a second post-operative
appointment with Respondent and was prescribed Silvadene cream.

8. Despite documented post-operative complications, there are no documented attempts
by Respondent to follow-up with Patient A after the March 22, 2021, post-operative appointment
and Patient A was not seen again by Respondent or any of his associates at Mia Aesthetics.

9. There are no documented attempts to refer Patient A to another physician near
Patient A’s home following the March 22, 2021, appointment.

10. Patient A subsequently developed open wounds which became infected, requiring
wound debridement and led to scarring at the surgical site.

COUNTI

11, All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

reference as though fully set forth herein.

12. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for

jating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
couNTH
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation -
Failure to Consult

16. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

17. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NR 630.306(1)(b)(2).

18. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of|
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

condition after March 22, 2021. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care
provider to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition. Such a
timely consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and may have enhanced the
quality of medical care provided to Patient A with regard to her post-operative complications
following a Brazilian butt lift with liposuction procedure performed by Respondent on
March 19, 2021.

20. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
