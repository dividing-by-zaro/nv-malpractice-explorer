COMPLAINT

(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attomey for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Brian Tracy Evans, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues ts Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows

1, Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 17826). Respondent was

originally licensed by the Board on April 4, 2018, and has a specialty in interventional radiology.

2 Patient A? was a seventy-seven (77) year-old female when she first presented to
Respondent.
3. On June 28, 2022, Patient A presented to Respondent, an interventional radiologist,

at Comprehensive Integrated Care (CIC), an outpatient setting, for discussion of endovascular
treatment. Patient A had been previously diagnosed with a long segment chronic occlusion of the
us

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Chowdhury H_ Ahsan, M.D., Ph.D., FAC,

a

right superficial femoral artery (SFA) and had been experiencing chronic limb ischemia with
ischemic rest pain.

4 During the June 28, 2022, visit, Respondent assessed Patient A with peripheral
artery disease, SFA occlusion, claudication in peripheral vascular disease, and critical limb.
ischemia of both lower extremities. Respondent also noted that Patient A had a long history of|
peripheral artery disease as well as a strong smoking history. Patient A opted not to undergo open
surgery to treat the occlusion and instead wanted to explore the possibility of a less invasive
endovascular procedure.

5. On July 15, 2022, Patient A returned to CIC and underwent an angiogram of the
right leg, which demonstrated a chronic total, right SFA occlusion. This condition was treated by
another physician with angioplasty, atherectomy, and laser.

6. On August 2, 2022, Patient A returned to CIC with recurrent, severe right leg pain.
Respondent performed a right leg angiogram, which demonstrated re-occlusion of the SFA with a
thrombus (blood clot) on the common femoral bifurcation in Patient A’s leg. Patient A’s
preoperative diagnosis consisted of peripheral vascular disease and SFA occlusion,

7. That same day, Respondent treated Patient A’s occluded SFA by performing an
extensive thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty with stenting.

8. During these procedures, Respondent mispositioned the proximal stent, which
partially covered the opening of Patient A’s profunda femoris artery. According to Respondent's
notes, Respondent recognized that the profunda femoris artery did not opacify and attempted to
restore patency by performing an angioplasty of the profunda femoris artery.

9. However, Respondent did not recognize that the profunda femoris artery was
actually occluded with a clot. Instead, Respondent attributed the non-visualization of the profunda
femoris artery to “preferential flow into the SFA” and finished the procedure.

10. Due to the partial occlusion of the profunda femoris artery caused by Respondent's
August 2, 2022, procedure, Patient A no longer had back-up blood flow via collaterals from the
profunda femoris artery. After the August 2, 2022, procedure, Patient A’s SFA became re-

occluded.

11. On August 4, 2022, Patient A called Respondent's office with complaints of severe

2'|| right lower extremity pain.
3 12. Patient A’s complaints of severe pain, as well as her medical history and recent
4] history involving endovascular procedures, collectively indicated acute limb ischemia caused by
5 || thrombosis. Acute limb ischemia requires emergent evaluation and treatment and, if left
6 || untreated, can lead to tissue death and potentially limb loss
7 13. However, on August 4, 2022, Respondent did not note the possibility of acute limb
8 || ischemia and did not recommend of order Patient A go to the emergency room (ER) immediately.
9 Instead, Respondent advised that Patient A obtain a stat ultrasound. Due to the
a 10 || unavaitabilty of an ultrasound technician at CIC on August 4, 2022, Respondent referred Patient
Z. 11 |] A to Nevada Vein & Vascular for the stat ultrasound.
oF 2 15. On August 5, 2022, Patient A presented to Nevada Vein and Vascular and was
F | i A 3 13 |] recognized to be in acute limb ischemia and sent to the ER emergently.
g 3 th 14 16, In the ER, on August 5, 2022, Patient A was correctly diagnosed with acute limb
au a 15 ]] ischemia and taken to surgery. That same day, a vascular surgeon performed surgery on the
Pe 16 || ischemic leg. During surgery, the orifice of the profunda femoris artery was found to be partially
ge 17 ]] covered by stents and the profunda to be occluded. Patient A then successfully underwent a right

20. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
treating Patient A, by failing, on August 4, 2022, to (1) recognize that Patient A had acute limb
ischemia due to re-occlusion of the SFA stents placed on August 2, 2022 and the thrombosis of
the profunda femoris artery secondary to the stent placement; and (2) act emergently to diagnose
and treat Patient A’s acute ischemia, which placed Patient A at risk for imminent limb loss.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent 1s subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;
