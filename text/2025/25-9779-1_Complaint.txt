COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through William P. Shogren, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Kevin Fredrick Lasko, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 7018). Respondent was originally
licensed by the Board on March 5, 1994,

2. Patient A? was a fifty-three (53) year-old male at the time of the events at issue

3. On April 18, 2023, Patient A presented to a cardiologist for discussion and evaluation
of Patient A’s history of recurrent atrial fibrillation. Patient A elected to undergo radiofrequency
(RF) ablation, wherein catheters would be used to deliver radiofrequency energy to destroy the heart
tissue causing the atrial fibrillation (hereinafter, the “ablation procedure”).

vw

} The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Chowdhury H. Ahsan, M.D., Ph.D, FACC,
Ms. Pamela J. Beal, and Irwin B, Simon, M.D., FACS.

4, Patient A presented to Renown Regional Medical Center (Renown) on
June 23, 2023, for the ablation procedure, to be performed by the cardiologist Respondent was the
anesthesiologist for this procedure.

5. At approximately 8:00 a.m. that day, Respondent induced general anesthesia with
propofol 200mg followed by systemic neuromuscular blockade with rocuronium 60mg.
Respondent intubated Patient A at 8:04 a.m, and placed an ultrasound probe at 8:08 a.m
Throughout the procedure, anesthesia was maintained with repeated administration of rocuronium
and consistent delivery of inhaled sevoflurane at conspired concentration of 1.2% to 2.2%.

6. Throughout the procedure, Respondent obtained blood pressure readings via a
noninvasive blood pressure cuff every two (2) to three (3) minutes. Respondent also recorded the
systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures as well as Patient A’s heart rate every one (1) to three

(3) minutes.

7. The procedure began at approximately 8:19 a.m. and lasted until approximately
11:51 am,
8. A mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg 1s necessary to maintain adequate

hepatic and renal perfusion.

9. Additionally, a patient must have adequate cerebral perfusion pressure to maintain
adequate blood flow to the brain. Cerebral perfusion pressure is a mean arterial pressure minus the
intracranial pressure, with the average intracranial pressure measuring 5 to 15 mmHg. The
minimum cerebral perfusion pressure required to prevent cerebral ischemic injury is 55-60 mmHg
Assuming a normal intracranial pressure, the recommended minimum cerebral perfusion pressure
is 55-60 mmHg.

10. Upon information and behef, when Patient A presented to Respondent on June 23,
2023, he did not have evidence of reduced or increased intracranial pressure. In Patient A’s case,
cerebral perfusion pressures below 55-60 mmHg could potentially lead to cerebral hypoperfusion
and anoxic brain injury.

LL. In Patient A’s type of procedure, involving ablation, it was expected that there would
be significant changes 1n blood pressure. Therefore, close monitoring of blood pressure was
essential to maintain adequate blood pressure.

12. At approximately 10:19 a.m,, Patient A began experiencing episodes of critically
low blood pressure (hypotension). At this time, Patient A’s blood pressure reading was recorded as
32 mmHg. Patient A further demonstrated MAP recordings of 39 mmbg at 10:25 a.m., 33 mmHg
at 11:01 a.m , 40 mmHg at 11:02 a.m., and $7 mmHg at 11-19 a.m.

13, The anesthesia record also noted three (3) episodes where average cerebral perfusion
pressure fell below 55 mmHg minimum for over ten (10) minutes. Between 10:19 a.m. and
10:32 a.m., Patient A experienced cerebral perfusion pressures averaging 43 mmHg. Between
10:43 am. and 11:02 am., Patient A experienced cerebral perfusion pressures averaging
46.45 mmHg. Between 11:16 am. and 11:32 am., Patient A experienced cerebral perfusion
pressures averaging 50.4 mmHg.

14, Additionally, between 10:29 a.m, and 11:17 a.m., Patient A demonstrated episodes
of tachycardia, where his heart rate was recorded as over 100 beats per minute, indicating the
potential for significant hypertension.

15. At approximately 10:29 a.m., Respondent began administering vasoactive
medications in an attempt to treat Patient A’s hypotension episodes. These medications consisted
of intravenous phenylephrine boluses, which were administered at 10:29 am. 10:47 am,
10:57 am, and 10:59 a.m, and a norepinephrine infusion which started at 11:07 a.m, and
subsequently stopped at 11:51 a.m.

16. However, Patient A continually demonstrated episodes of hypotension throughout
the remainder of the procedure. Despite Patient A’s significant hypotension, which remained
uncorrected despite pharmacologic interventions, the cardiologist continued the procedure between
10:19 am and approximately 11:17 a.m.

17. During the three (3) episodes where Patient A’s average cerebral perfusion pressure
fell below 55 mmHg for over ten (10) minutes, Respondent did not address Patient A's significant

u


hypotension via further methods, such as increasing the administration of phenylephrine and/or
norepinephrine.

18. Further, when Patient A’s blood pressure dropped dangerously low, Respondent did
not reduce the level of sevoflurane gas, which is known to be a vasodilating agent, in order to
improve Patient A’s blood pressure and thus reduce his hypotension.

19. Respondent's notes regarding the procedure further do not reflect that Respondent,
at any time, recommended to the cardiologist that the elective procedure be discontinued altogether,
or at least paused until such a time that Patient A’s blood pressure could be adequately corrected

20. The procedure was completed and Patient A was extubated at 11:48 am., and
norepinephrine was stopped at 11:51 a.m. Patient A was then taken to the post-anesthesta care unit.

21. Patient A was then soon after found to be unresponsive and obtunded. A stroke alert
was activated and Patient A required re-intubation to secure his airway. Patient A was then
transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he was followed by neurology and internal
medicine.

22. Patient A underwent an MRI of the brain on June 24, 2023, which demonstrated
ischemic injuries consistent with anoxic brain injury, i.e., Patient A’s brain was completely deprived
of oxygen. Patient A also demonstrated evidence of organ disruption consistent with hypoperfusion.

23. Patient A remained in the acute care setting at Renown through July 19, 2023.
Patient A was subsequently transferred to a skilled nursing facility for long-term care.

27. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, on June 23, 2023,
Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances when rendering medical services to Patient A, by failing to maintain, while Patient
A was under the effects of anesthesia, adequate blood pressure and therefore minimum cerebral
perfusion pressure during the June 23, 2023, ablation procedure, including, but not limited, failing
to adjust the sevoflurane level to improve Patient A’s blood pressure after approximately 10:19 am.
Respondent also did not effectively communicate to the cardiologist about Patient A’s significant
hypotension starting at approximately 10:19 a.m, which may have led to the procedure being
discontinued or paused.

28. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2) within
twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early Case
Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

Be ‘That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been a
violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4 That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this case
as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5 That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact, conclusions
of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
