5. The chest x-ray taken on March 2, 2022, demonstrated a “left upper lobe infiltrate.”
The hospital staff member who reviewed the chest x-ray, at approximately 7:25 a.m. on
March 2, 2022, recommended a computed tomography (CT) scan of Patient A’s chest with
contrast.

6. Patient A’s troponin and D-dimer test results returned on the morning of|
March 2, 2022, with abnormal and elevated results. Patient A’s Troponin I level was 0.107 ng/mL
and the D-dimer test demonstrated an elevated result of 2,743 ng/mL, at or around 9:41 a.m.

7. According to Patient A’s St. Rose Dominican Hospital-Stena Campus records,
“[fJor this D-dimer test, a result below 230 ng/mL is reported to have 100% negative predictive
value for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. A result below this level is therefore
useful in helping to exclude deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.”

8. __Anelevated D-dimer level suggests an increased risk of blood clots.

9. Patient A was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and arrived in
the afternoon of May 2, 2022, where Respondent, a pediatric critical care physician, assumed care
of Patient A. After assuming care, Respondent noted that Patient A was obese.

10. Sometime in the aftemoon or evening of March 2, 2022, Patient A was placed on a
twenty-three (23) hour electroencephalogram (EEG) test. The EEG demonstrated no evidence of
seizure or epileptiform activity.

11, Additionally, during the evening of March 2, 2022, Patient A underwent an
echocardiogram, which demonstrated evidence of pulmonary hypertension.

12. During Patient A’s hospitalization on March 2, 2022, and March 3, 2022, Patient A
continued to experience an increased heart rate (tachycardia), which was noted to be 122 bpm on
March 3, 2022, at approximately 8:00 a.m.

13, On the morning of March 3, 2022, Patient A’s D-dimer and Troponin I levels
remained elevated. At approximately 4:48 am., Patient A's D-dimer test result showed an
elevated rate of 4,786 ng/mL. At approximately 7:00 a.m. Patient A’s Troponin I level was
recorded as 0.083 ng/mL.

14, Patient A also experienced continued rapid breathing (tachypnea), which was noted
and flagged in the medical records as “H” the evening of March 2, 2022, and moming of
March 3, 2022.

15, During Patient A’s hospital stay on March 2, 2022, and March 3, 2022, Respondent
did not obtain a CT scan of the chest with contrast. Respondent noted she was “[uJnable to obtain

chest x-ray and CT today as patient 23-hour EEG. Once this is completed we will proceed with

16. On March 3, 2022, at approximately 4:40 p.m, Patient A experienced a near-
syncopal episode. Respondent evaluated Patient A shortly thereafter and ordered two (2) one-liter
boluses of normal saline and requested a cardiology consultation.

17. During the evening of March 3, 2022, Patient A’s heart rate dropped acutely and a
“code blue” was initiated.

18. Patient A passed away on March 3, 2022, at approximately 9:00 p.m. Patient A’s
cause of death was later listed as due to a pulmonary thromboembolism, saddle type.

NRS 630.301 (4) - Malpractice

19. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein

20. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

21. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

22. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
treating Patient A on March 2, 2022, and March 3, 2022, by failing to obtain the appropriate
diagnostic testing, specifically an urgent chest CT scan with contrast, to evaluate Patient A for a

pulmonary embolism. Between March 2, 2022 and March 3, 2022, Patient A clearly

demonstrated several indications that were consistent with a risk of pulmonary embolism,
including, but not limited to, Patient A’s (1) noted obesity; (2) Patient A’s presenting symptoms;
(3) Patient A’s chest x-ray results from March 2, 2022; (4) continued tachycardia; (5) continued
tachypnea; (6) continued elevated D-Dimer and Troponin I levels; and (7) pulmonary
hypertension based on Patient A’s echocardiogram results. Given his clinical presentation, Patient
A required an urgent CT scan of his chest with contrast to potentially identify a pulmonary
embolism and initiate appropriate therapy, to be taken on the evening of March 2, 2022, or, at the
very latest, during the afternoon of March 3, 2022.

23. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

25. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the “failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute
grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

26. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to correctly document her actions when he treated
Patient A, by, among other things, failing to document the possibility of pulmonary embolism,
especially considering a previous ED physician ordered a D-Dimer test to stratify for pulmonary
embolism risk on March 2, 2022 As a result, the medical records were not timely, legible,
accurate, and complete.

27. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
