Against:

FILED
MICHAEL SCOTT ZIMMERMAN, M.D.,
Respondent. APR 03 2025

NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

MEpICAL INERS
By:

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

COMPLAINT

(Board), by and through Alexander J. Hinman, Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Michael Scott Zimmerman, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

lL. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a physician holding an active
license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 7539). Respondent was originally
licensed by the Board on August 31, 1995.

2. Patient A? was a sixty-two (62) year-old male at the time of the events at issue.

3. Respondent first saw Patient A in 2018 and performed a colonoscopy for a
previous diagnosis of metastatic colon cancer and found diverticulitis. Respondent then removed
a large tubular adenoma. Additionally, Patient A had developed end stage renal disease in 2018.

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Chowdhury H. Ahsan, M.D., Ph.D., FACC,
Ms. Pamela J. Beal, and Irwin B. Simon, M.D., FACS.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4. On June 13, 2022, Respondent saw Patient A for a renal transplant evaluation, and
it was noted that Patient A was requiring hemodialysis and that based on surveillance guidelines
Patient A did not need a colonoscopy for another two and a half (2.5) years.

5. On October 11, 2022, Patient A was seen by Respondent to assess his liver with a
FibroScan? with elastography.

6. On October 27, 2022, the results of the test revealed that Patient A had clinically
significant portal hypertension suggestive of compensated advanced chronic liver disease. As a
result of this finding, Respondent recommended a screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

7. On February 6, 2023, Patient A had a follow-up appointment with Respondent to
review labs and imaging. In Respondent’s assessment, Patient A had chronic liver disease, end-
stage renal disease, as well as possible low cardiac ejection fraction. Respondent’s plan for
Patient A was to proceed with an EGD utilizing monitored anesthesia care (MAC) sedation.

8. Patient A’s clinical course took a marked decremental shift over the next three (3)
months. Specifically, he developed large volume ascites and required repeat ultrasound guided
therapeutic paracenteses. Paracenteses were performed on April 24, 2023, March 6, 2023, and
March 26, 2023. This amounted to 5.9 L, 5.9 L, and 5.1 L removed, respectively, all of which
were ordered by Respondent, for a total of 17 L of fluid removed in five (5) weeks. All the while
Patient A continued receiving dialysis.

9. During this period, Patient A shifted from a compensated form of chronic liver
disease to a decompensated form. Despite this, the safety of proceeding with an endoscopy in an
ambulatory surgical center (ASC) for screening purposes with the complications of
decompensated liver disease, dialysis dependent renal disease, and a possible cardiac condition
were not questioned by Respondent. Thus, Respondent proceeded with an EGD on June 7, 2023,
at an ASC.

10. On June 7, 2023, Patient A had clinical compromise during the EGD that required
life-saving interventions and an emergent transfer to Mountain View Hospital, where Patient A

would remain, and ultimately expire three (3) days after the EGD procedure on June 10, 2023.

3 FibroScan is a non-invasive ultrasound test that measures liver’s stiffness.

11. Even though an EGD was performed on June 7, 2023, there is no documentation of,
pre-procedural labs nor is there a pre-procedural history or physical examination. As a result,
Respondent failed to discover that Patient A did not have his regular dialysis treatment the day
before the EGD due to hypotension.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

12. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

13. NRS 63.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

14. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

15. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A, when he failed to perform a proper history and physical
examination prior to performing an endoscopy on Patient A who had active comorbid medical
conditions. Additionally, Respondent failed to check Patient A’s electrolyte levels the day before
proceeding with the EGD despite Patient A having end-stage renal disease.

16. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records

17. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

19. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by, among other things, failing to correctly document any pre-
procedural labs, Patient A’s pre-procedural history, nor a physical examination when he treated
Patient A. Additionally, Respondent failed to correctly document any discussion with Patient A
regarding the safety of proceeding with an endoscopy in the ambulatory surgical center with the
comorbidities of decompensated liver disease, dialysis dependent renal disease, and in the setting
of a possible cardiac condition. Thus, the medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, nor
complete.

20. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
