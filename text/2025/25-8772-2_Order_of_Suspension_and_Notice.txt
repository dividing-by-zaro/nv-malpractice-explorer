5. Respondent was served with the Board Order for Urine and Hair Sample (Drug
Testing Order) on September 9, 2025, pursuant to NRS 630.318 which required compliance by the

Methamphetamine; 2. Respondent violated a the Board’s Drug Testing Order to undergo urine and
hair testing to determine his fitness for duty to practice medicine.
