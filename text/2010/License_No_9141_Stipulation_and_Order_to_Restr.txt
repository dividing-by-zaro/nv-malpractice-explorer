Edward O. Cousineau, Deputy Executive Director for the Board and attorney for the Investigative
Committee, and Conrad R. Murray, M.D., by and through his counsel of record, that based upon a
criminal matter currently being prosecuted in the state of California related to alleged non-
therapeutic prescribing of medications that allegedly resulted in the death of a patient and based
upon the condition of bail in that criminal matter, Dr. Murray agrees that he is restricted from
prescribing or administering, except as mentioned below, any anesthetic agent normally
administered by an anesthesiologist, including but not limited to Propofol or any other heavy
sedative medication used as anesthesia, in the course of his medical practice in the State of
Nevada.

It is understood by the parties that Dr. Murray may still prescribe or administer any other
medications, including but not limited to pain and anti-anxiety medications or local or topical
anesthetics, in the course of his medical practice in the state of Nevada. And that Dr. Murray

may, in concert with other physicians, participate in medical treatment which involves the use of

Propofol or any other heavy sedative medication used as anesthesia, as long as Dr. Murray does
not personally prescribe or administer these medications.

Further, Dr. Murray has cooperated in the investigation regarding this Stipulation and
agrees that the aforementioned restrictions on his medical practice in the state of Nevada shall not
be modified, stayed or removed, until there is a final resolution of the criminal allegations in
California or until the Board takes other action to modify the Order so as to properly reflect the
terms of bail as they may be modified in California. Once the referenced criminal matters are
resolved, or at any time prior thereto, Dr. Murray may petition the Investigative Committee in
writing for removal or revision of this stipulation by showing that the bail requirements are no
longer in effect or have been modified, stayed or removed.
