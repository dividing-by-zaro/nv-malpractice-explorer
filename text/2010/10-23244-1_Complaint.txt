COMPLAINT ERS

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time of approval of the filing of the instant complaint, of Charles N. Held, M.D.,
Benjamin Rodriguez, M.D. and Ms. Jean Stoess, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Marilyn Atkins, R.R.T., hereinafter referred to as Ms. Atkins, has violated the provisions of
NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Ms. Atkins currently holds an active license to practice respiratory care (License
no. RC802) and was so licensed on December 7, 2002 after appearing before the Board.
Ms. Atkins received her license on the condition that she successfully continues to participate with | .
the Nevada Health Professionals Assistance Foundation (NHPAF) due to concerns about past
issues with prescription controlled substances.

2. In February 2008, NHPAF indicated it could no longer advocate for Ms. Atkins due
to Ms. Atkins only being in partial compliance with the program.

3. Ms. Atkins was ordered to submit to a urine and hair drug screen in March 2008 the
results of which were negative.

4. Ms. Atkins returned to the NHPAF program in April 2008, however, in June 2008, |
the Board was once again notified that Ms. Atkins was out of compliance with the program. A

patient drug utilization profile in July 2008 indicated that Ms. Atkins had been receiving

hydrocodone prescriptions for the past several months and Ms. Atkins admitted to Board staff that
she occasionally used the substance for various ailments.

5. In September 2008, Ms. Atkins was allowed to change drug treatment programs
and was ordered by an Investigative Committee of the Board to present to the PRN program
through Monte Vista Hospital and enter into a contract for drug treatment and monitoring.

Ms. Atkins signed a treatment contract with the PRN program on October 15, 2008.

6. In June 2009, the PRN program terminated Ms. Atkins for failing to follow her
contract with the program.

7. A recent drug utilization profile indicates that Ms. Atkins has been receiving
prescriptions for hydrocodone between January 2009 through October 2009.

Count I

8. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.3065(2)(a) provides that willful failure to
comply with an order of the Board or of an investigative committee of the Board is grounds for
initiating discipline against a licensee.

9. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.540(23) provides that disciplinary action
may be initiated against a respiratory therapist licensee if they have violated any provision that
would subject a practitioner of medicine to discipline pursuant to NRS 630.301 to 630.3065
inclusive.

10... Ms. Atkins failed to follow the contract she entered into with the PRN program
through Monte Vista Hospital and thus has violated NRS 630.3065(2)(a) and accordingly is
subject to discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section
630.555 of the Nevada Administrative Code.

would subject a practitioner of medicine to discipline pursuant to NRS 630.301 to 630.3065
inclusive.

13. Ms. Atkins has not completed a treatment program for the use of narcotic
prescription medication and continues to utilize them creating an inability to practice respiratory

subject to discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section
630.555 of the Nevada Administrative Code.
