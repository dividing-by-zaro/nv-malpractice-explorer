COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Van V. Heffner and Beverly Neyland, M.D.,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Ismat Chaudhery, M.D., hereinafter referred to as
Respondent, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint,
stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 7837), and has been
so licensed since June 21, 1996 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Respondent is the President, Secretary, Treasurer, sole director and sole shareholder
in Chaudhery Pediatrics (“Chaudhery”), a professional corporation. Chaudhery does business as
Mountain View Pediatrics. Respondent is, therefore, personally and individually, Chaudhery.
Thus, any conviction against Chaudhery, as the corporation, is a conviction against Respondent
based upon such conduct, omission(s), actions and/or inactions.

3. On December 15, 2009, Respondent, on behalf of Chaudhery, plead guilty to one
count of Submitting False Claims: Medicaid Fraud, a felony violation of NRS 422.540(1). The
Judgment of Conviction was entered against Chaudhery on January 14, 2010 by the district court

judge. A certified copy of the Judgment of Conviction is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

4. The basis for the guilty plea in the aforementioned matter was a series of claimed
services provided to Medicaid recipients J.M. (Medicaid ID #00000045292) and S.M. (Medicaid
ID # 72174200010). On or about September 2005, March 2007 and June 2007, Chaudhery
claimed to have provided services, through its employees and/or agents, and submitted claims to
Nevada Medicaid for reimbursement for those services. Respondent was/is ultimately, personally
and individually responsible for such actions.

5. These claims were false, as C.B., the parent of both Medicaid recipients J.M. and
S.M., denied that they received services that Chaudhery claimed and for which it billed Medicaid.
These fraudulent claims were submitted by Chaudhery utilizing its Medicaid provider billing

number. Respondent was/is ultimately, personally and individually responsible for such actions.
