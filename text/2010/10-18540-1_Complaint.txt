COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing was approved of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Mr. Van Heffner, and
Beverly Neyland, M.D., having a reasonable basis to believe that Michael Forrest, P.A.-C
hereinafter referred to as Mr. Forrest, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby
issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as
follows:

1. Mr. Forrest is currently licensed in active-not working status (License No. PA 639),
but at all times relevant herein was licensed in active status and was so licensed on March 2, 2000
by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the
Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a thirty-two year old male patient at the time he began to see
Mr. Forrest. His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in
the Patient Designation served on Mr. Forrest along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A was first seen as a patient at Banner Churchill Convenience Care Clinic
(“Clinic”) in April 2003.

4, In June 2005, Patient A injured his back while at work and received some pain

medications, x-rays, an MRI and physical therapy which appeared to resolve some of his pain

issues. Patient A continued to receive relatively small amounts of narcotic pain medications from
his treating physician at the Clinic.

5. In October 2006, Patient A reinjured his back. He was seen by Mr. Forrest and
prescribed a different narcotic pain medication.

6. Patient A began to see a different primary treating physician at the Clinic in the
late fall of 2006 and also saw Mr. Forrest on occasion. Patient A was continually prescribed
narcotic pain medications. Referrals were made for Patient A to see a back specialist, whom he
did eventually see. He also began receiving epidurals through Reno Orthopedic Clinic in Reno in
2007 and some diagnostic studies were ordered in 2007.

7. In October 2007, Patient A’s primary treating physician left the Clinic. Patient A’s
last prescription from this physician indicated an increase in the dosage of his narcotic pain
medication.

8. Patient A’s care was taken over by Mr. Forrest in October 2007. Mr. Forrest began
to increase the amount of narcotic pain medication prescribed to Patient A. At this time,
Mr. Forrest had little or no experience in treating chronic pain patients. Mr. Forrest continued to
see Patient A for his back pain through April 2009 and continued to prescribe narcotic pain
medications to Patient A approximately every three weeks.

9. The medical records for Patient A during the time he was seen by Mr. Forrest
appear incomplete and do not include pertinent information regarding the care of Patient A. The
records do not indicate why there was an increase in the amount of narcotic pain medication
prescribed. There is no record of Mr. Forrest ever completing a full physical examination of
Patient A.

10. Although Patient A was seen in consultation by some specialists during the time
that he was seen by Mr. Forrest, Mr. Forrest continued to prescribe narcotic pain medication to
Patient A in the same manner and did not develop or change a treatment plan for Patient A’s pain.
Mr. Forrest also failed to refer Patient A or transfer his care to a practitioner more experienced or
specialized in the treatment of chronic pain and/or low back pain patients.

11. Although Mr. Forrest had little or no training or experience in treating chronic pain
patients, he failed to consult with his supervising physician during the time that he treated Patient
A with narcotic pain medication.

Count I

12. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

13. NAC 630.380(1)(f) provides that malpractice is grounds for initiating discipline
against a physician assistant licensee.

14. Mr. Forrest failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when he failed to perform a complete examination of Patient A
during the time he treated him; failed to develop or implement an appropriate treatment plan for
Patient A; failed to refer Patient A for continued care to a more appropriate practitioner and failed
to consult his supervising physician regarding the care of Patient A although he had little or no
experience or training in treating chronic pain patients and therefore Mr. Forrest is in violation of
NAC 630.380(1)(f).

15. By reason of the foregoing, Mr. Forrest is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NAC 630.410.

Count II

16. NAC 630.380(1)(n) provides that the violation of NRS 630.301 to NRS 630.3065,
inclusive, by a physician assistant, is grounds for initiating disciplinary action against a physician
assistant licensee.

17. NRS 630.3065(1) provides that failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate and
complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds for
discipline.

18. Mr. Forrest failed to maintain complete medical records regarding the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A when he failed to document any physical examination of Patient A,
the reasoning for the increase in the amount of narcotics prescribed or any plan of treatment for

Patient A and therefore Mr. Forrest is in violation of NRS 630.3065(1).

19. By reason of the foregoing, Mr. Forrest is subject to discipline by the Nevada State

Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NAC 630.410.
Count Il

20. NAC 630.380(1)(m) provides that violation of a provision of NAC 630.230 by a
physician assistant is grounds for initiating disciplinary action against a physician assistant.

21. NAC 630.230(1)(1) prohibits the writing of prescriptions for controlled substances
to treat acute pain or chronic pain in a manner that deviates from the guidelines set forth in the
Model Guidelines for the Use of Controlled Substances for the Treatment of Pain adopted by the
Board.

22. Mr. Forrest deviated from the Model Guidelines when he failed to do an evaluation
of Patient A, failed to develop a treatment plan and failed to perform periodic reviews of Patient
A’s treatment and failed to keep accurate and complete records regarding his care and treatment.
Accordingly, Mr. Forrest is in violation of NAC 630.230(1)(1).

23. By reason of the foregoing, Mr. Forrest is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NAC 630.410.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Mr. Forrest notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service
of the Complaint.

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a
formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3, That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
determines to impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical
Practice Act (Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 630) committed by Mr. Forrest; and

4. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Mr. Forrest its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the

sanctions imposed; and
