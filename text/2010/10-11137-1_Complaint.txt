4. On November 6, 2008, Patient A contacted Dr. Haduong’s office. A medical
assistant from Dr. Haduong’s office contacted Evergreens Drug, indicating that Patient A had been
approved for a one-week emergency fill for methadone and oxycodone. The medical assistant also
indicated that Dr. Haduong was in a procedure and unable to write the prescription, however the
medical assistant faxed a copy of the prior prescriptions as the dosages and directions for use
would remain the same as those indicated on the September 2008 prescriptions.

5. The prescriptions were filled by Evergreens Drug, however the pharmacy
manager/owner indicated that he would require the written prescription within seventy-two hours.
The written prescription was not received by Evergreens Drug.

6. On November 11, 2008, the wife of Patient A found him dead in bed. The cause of
death is listed on the death certificate as coronary atherosclerosis and a significant contributing
factor was noted as opiate intoxication.

7. Dr. Haduong’s medical records for Patient A indicate that Patient A only saw
Dr. Haduong once and was prescribed medication only once.

8. The Nevada State Board of Pharmacy investigated the matter and in the course of
the investigation discovered that Evergreens Pharmacy had received backdated prescriptions from
Dr. Haduong in August 2009 for the November 6, 2008 prescription fills after the pharmacy
manager/owner requested the prescriptions. The pharmacy manager/owner then destroyed the
faxed copies of the September 2008 prescriptions.

9. During the course of the investigation of the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy,

Dr. Haduong admitted to writing prescriptions in August 2009 for the narcotics filled in November
2008 without reviewing the file.

10. On May 13, 2010, the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy issued its Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order taking disciplinary action against Dr. Haduong and finding he was
in violation of several regulations adopted by the State Board of Pharmacy as well as in violation
of both federal and state laws related to the prescribing of a controlled substance.
