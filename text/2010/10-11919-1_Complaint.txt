MEDICAL EXAMINERS

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time of filing of Benjamin Rodriguez, M.D., Chairman, Beverly A. Neyland, M.D.,
Member, and Van V. Heffner, Member, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Daniel Link, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the provisions of
NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 8482), and has been
so licensed since December 8, 1997 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a twenty-six year old (26) female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but her identity is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A presented to the Surgical Weight Control Center of Nevada on
January 18, 2008. She sought assistance for weightloss. After an examination by
Daniel Soong, M.D., laparoscopic surgery for placement of an adjustable Gastric silicone band
was planned for February 14, 2008.

4. A urine pregnancy test was administered to Patient A just prior to surgery on
February 14, 2008. Her urine sample was taken at 7:00 a.m. The urine test result was obtained at
7:48 a.m. and was positive for pregnancy. It also had the words "STAT STAT STAT" on it.

5. Respondent was the attending anesthesiologist in this matter. It appears that the
positive urine test result was never called in or reported to the Respondent. Respondent,
moreover, did not follow-up on the results prior to the surgery. The laparoscopic surgery for
placement of the Gastric silicone band on Patient A, and of course the necessary anesthesia,
proceeded without Respondent's knowledge of her pregnant status. Surgery proceeded with no
apparent complications.

6. Patient A began skipping menstrual cycles in March, 2008. At a follow-up
appointment, she asked Dr. Soong, M.D. about missing her menstrual cycle and was told that it
was normal after this type of surgery and related rapid weight loss. Patient A also skipped her
menstrual cycle in April, 2008.

7. Patient A did not have a menstrual cycle in May, 2008. On May 19, 2008, Patient
A did not feel well and had a sharp pain in her left side. She went to the University Medical
Center Emergency Room for treatment. A urine sample was then taken that established Patient
A's pregnant status. An ultrasound placed her at nineteen (19) weeks gestation. Thus, Patient A
was two to three (2-3) weeks pregnant at the time of the laparoscopic surgery and related
anesthesia administered by Respondent.

8. As the attending anesthesiologist, the recognition and reporting of abnormal tests
was Respondent's responsibility. Respondent should have verified the results of the pregnancy test
prior to surgery. Once the positive test results were obtained, Respondent should have notified
Patient A that she was pregnant and canceled the elective procedure.

reference as though fully set forth herein.

10. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of
a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

11. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

12. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under the same or similar circumstances when he failed and omitted to obtain and verify the
results of the positive pregnancy test as well as not being able to cancel the elective surgical
procedure upon receipt of the positive test result.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service
of the Complaint.

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a
formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS §630.339(3);

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
determines to impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical
Practice Act (Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 630) committed by Respondent; and

4. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Respondent its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the
sanctions imposed; and
