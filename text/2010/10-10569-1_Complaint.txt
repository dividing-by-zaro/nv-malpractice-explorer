COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Mr. Van V. Heffner, and Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., by and
through Edward Cousineau, General Counsel for the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Victor Grigoryev Grigg, M.D., hereinafter referred to as
"Respondent," has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint,
stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent was actively-licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada on
August 4, 1994, and at all times alleged herein, was so licensed by the Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A, whose true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint,
underwent paravaginal and enterocele repair related to a diagnosis of pelvic organ prolapse on
April 25, 2006.

3. Subsequent review of the medical records related to Patient A’s surgical treatment
by Respondent show a serious lack of adequate or accurate documentation and detail to
reconstruct the facts of the actual operative care provided to Patient A. For example, after Patient
A underwent the initial surgical procedure, Patient A was returned to the operating room for a

second surgical procedure, where medical records indicate that “stents were placed in both

N



occluded ureters.” This documentation is in contravention of language in the original operative
note prepared by Respondent which indicated that both ureteric orifices were functioning
properly at the time of the initial surgery. Of most import, there is no dictation or operative note
prepared by Respondent that documents that Patient A even underwent the second surgical
procedure. Moreover, Patient A’s discharge summary, which was prepared by Respondent,
indicates that Patient A refused a blood transfusion prior to discharge, yet review of the nurses
notes indicate that Patient A actually received two units of packed red blood cells prior to her
discharge.

4. Section 630.3062(1) of the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) provides that failure to
maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of a patient, is grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

5. Respondent violated NRS 630.3062(1) when he failed to properly maintain medical
records related to Patient A and is subject to discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical
Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners fix a time and place for a formal
hearing;

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him, the time and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions against
him;

3, That the Board determine what sanctions it deems appropriate to impose for the
violation committed by Respondent; and

4, That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of facts,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed.

DATED this 222 “ day of February, 2010.
