FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed of
Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, by and through Bradley O. Van Ry,
Deputy General Counsel for the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, having a reasonable
basis to believe that Yvonne Barry, M.D., (Respondent), has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter
630, hereby issues its First Amended Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and
allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent was licensed in active status to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
on October 26, 1995 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, pursuant to the provisions
of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and at all times addressed herein was so licensed.
Beginning on April 8, 2010, Respondent’s license was summarily suspended by the Investigative
Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners for placing the health, safety and
welfare of the public at imminent risk.

2. Respondent specializes in Family Practice in the Las Vegas area.

3. The medical records in this matter relate to patients who will be herein referred to
as Patients A, B, C and D. The patients’ true identities have not been disclosed to protect their

privacy, but are disclosed in a separate Patient Designation incorporated by reference to this
Complaint and served upon Respondent with a copy of this complaint.

4, From approximately November 2008 to June 2009, Respondent wrote prescriptions
for controlled substances to Patient A, a twenty-two (22) year old female. These controlled
substances included, but were not limited to, Zolpidem, Alprazolam and Temazepam. It is
suspected that these prescriptions were not used by Patient A, but were picked up and likely used
by Respondent.

5. From approximately February 1997 to July 2009, Respondent wrote prescriptions
for controlled substances to Patient B, an approximately seventy year old female. These controlled
substances included, but were not limited to, Zolpidem, Phendimetrazine, Adipex, Ambien and
Phentermine. It is suspected that these prescriptions were not used by Patient B, but were picked
up and likely used by Respondent.

6. During February 2009, Respondent wrote prescriptions for controlled substances to
Patient C, a nineteen (19) year old male. These controlled substances included, but were not
limited to, Alprazolam, Zolpidem. It is suspected that these prescriptions were not used by Patient
C, but were picked up and likely used by Respondent.

7. From approximately December 1999 to April 2009, Respondent wrote
prescriptions for controlled substances to Patient D, a fifty-one (51) year old male. These
controlled substances included, but were not limited to, Temazepam, Zolpidem, Hydrocodone. It
is suspected that these prescriptions were not used by Patient D, but were picked up and likely
used by Respondent.

8. All the above patients were family members of Respondent. The foregoing further
demonstrates Respondent’s ongoing pattern of using family members’ names as the patient(s) to
write prescriptions for controlled substances. She would then pick up the prescription(s) in her
family members’ names and convert the controlled substances for her own, personal use.

9. The evidence further reveals that Respondent did not foster or maintain a
bona fide therapeutic relationship(s) with the foregoing patients as required under the law, Nevada

Administrative Code Section 639.945(0), Nevada Administrative Code Section 639.752(0) and

No



Nevada Administrative Code Section 639.752(2)(b)(2), for prescribing of controlled substances.
The prescriptions were written under a pretext of such therapeutic relationship(s) so that
Respondent could convert the controlled substances to her own personal use.

10. NRS §0.031, significantly, defines a “controlled substance” as a drug, immediate
precursor or other substance which is listed in schedule I, II, IN, IV or V for control by the State
Board of Pharmacy pursuant to NRS 453.146 and NAC 453.510 to NAC 453.550.

11. Through further investigation it was discovered that Respondent also wrote
prescriptions to herself for her own use. On at least one occasion, September 26, 2008,
Respondent wrote a prescription for Ambien to herself.

12. Additional investigation uncovered that Respondent was arrested for
Driving Under the Influence on November 10, 2003, October 16, 2008 and March 5, 2010. None
of these arrests were disclosed as required, within thirty days of arrest, or on the biennial licensing
renewal forms with the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, wherein it states, “Have you
been arrested, investigated for, charged with, convicted or, or pled guilty or nolo contender to any
criminal offense. ...”

13. | Due to growing concerns about a possible dependency issue for Respondent, the
Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners issued an order for a
drug and alcohol evaluation to Respondent and served her with it on September 30, 2009. While
being served with the order, Respondent agreed to enter into Michael’s House, an in-patient drug
rehabilitation facility. It is believed that she attended Michael’s House through
October 28, 2009 and successfully completed the program.

14. Because of continued concerns about possible drug dependency issues for
Respondent, she was ordered by the Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners to enter the PRN-PRN treatment program located at Montevista Hospital on
November 6, 2009. Respondent began participation on the same date, November 6, 2009. She
was, unfortunately, consistently non-compliant with the program throughout November, December
and January.

15. Due to Respondent’s non-compliance, on February 5, 2010, the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners, by and through its Investigative Committee, issued another order
(“Order’’) against Respondent. She was ordered to comply with each and every agreed upon term
in her drug and/or alcohol treatment and monitoring contractual agreement (“Agreement”) with
the PRN-PRN program. Respondent was served with the Order on February 9, 2010. Under the
terms of the Agreement and Order, Respondent was required to attend and participate in
rehabilitation meetings, monthly and weekly. Respondent was also to provide urine/serum
samples for drug screens at the discretion of the treatment center.

16. On April 5, 2010, Respondent failed, in violation of the existing Order, to appear
for arandom urine screen as prescribed under the agreement.

17. On April 6, 2010, Respondent failed, in violation of the existing Order, to appear
for her meeting with the PRN-PRN program director.

COUNT I

18. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

19. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.3065(2)(a) provides that the willful failure to
comply with an order of the Board or committee designated by the Board to investigate a
complaint against a physician is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

20. Respondent willfully failed to comply with an order of the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners by, among other things, continually being non-
compliant with the PRN-PRN agreement, program and related treatment as ordered.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the
Nevada Revised Statutes.

23. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.306(2)(a) provides that engaging in any
conduct which is intended to deceive is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

24. Respondent engaged in numerous instances of intending to deceive by, among
other things, her ongoing pattern of improper conduct of writing prescriptions in other’s names for
her own personal use and for self-prescribing a controlled substance.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the
Nevada Revised Statutes.

COUNT I

26. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

27. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.306(8) provides that habitual intoxication
from alcohol or dependency on controlled substances is grounds for initiating discipline against a
licensee.

28. The continuous and chronic nature of Respondent’s improper conduct demonstrates
her dependency on controlled substances. Further, Respondent has admitted to investigative staff
members of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners that she was writing fraudulent
prescriptions for phentermine in order to satisfy her addiction to it; that she was arrested in the
past for Driving Under the Influence; and, that she has done what she was accused of by the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners. All of Respondent’s admitted conduct was for the
purpose of satisfying her dependency on controlled substances. Respondent’s three DUI arrests
also demonstrate a problem with habitual intoxication from alcohol or dependency on controlled
substances.

29, By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the
Nevada Revised Statutes.
