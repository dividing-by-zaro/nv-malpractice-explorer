MEDIGAL EXAMINERS

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing of Benjamin Rodriguez, M.D., Chairman, Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., Member,
and Van V. Heffner, Member, having a reasonable basis to believe that Jennifer Sahm, M.D.,
hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby
issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as
follows:

1, Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 9500), and has been
so licensed since July 14, 2000 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a fifty-seven year old (57) male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A presented to Saint Mary's Regional Medical Center Emergency Room
(the "ER") on December 25, 2004 at 11:22 am. He complained of shortness of breath and sternal
chest pain. He described the chest pain as stabbing, dull. His physical assessment was described
as diaphoretic, cool and pale. Patient A's vital signs were normal except for an elevated blood

pressure.

4, The onset of the chest pain was identified by Patient A as that morning about 10:00
a.m., little more than one (1) hour before his presentation to the ER.

5. Patient A was treated with aspirin, oxygen, morphine, nitroglycerin, an anti-emetic
and anti-inflammatory medication. Diagnostic testing included a chest x-ray, CT scan of the chest,
an EKG and laboratory tests. The laboratory tests were taken from Patient A at 12:23 p.m. All
tests were either normal or non-diagnostic.

6. The differential diagnosis made by Respondent was cardiac v. pulmonary disease.
However, the majority of potentially dangerous lung pathologies were eliminated by the CT scan
of Patient A's chest. Thus, the identified cardiac pathology was likely. Patient A's shortness of
breath in the absence of pulmonary pathology from the CT scan, metabolic derangement or anemia
indicated that cardiac pathology was the likely cause of his dyspnea. Additionally, the "stuttering"
(intermittent) chest pain pointed to cardiac pathology as well.

7. Unfortunately, only one EKG was administered on Patient A. The EKG results, not
surprisingly, were non-diagnostic showing slight abnormalities only. In a case like this, a single
EKG is not sufficient. It cannot be used to rule in or rule out unstable angina or acute myocardial
infarction, so it is not helpful as a diagnostic tool by itself. It only gives a snapshot of the heart at
a particular moment and further EKG testing of Patient A was required. Another EKG would
have been helpful in reaching the correct diagnosis. Unfortunately, no repeat EKG was ever
performed.

8. The laboratory tests for cardiac enzymes were similarly deficient. The test samples
were collected at 12:23 p.m. just a short time after Patient A presented to the ER. Since the onset
of the chest pain was at 10:00 a.m., this was only about two and one half (2 1/2) hours after the
onset of chest pain. This was not enough time to adequately identify the leakage of cardiac
enzymes into the bloodstream.

9. Cardiac enzymes, significantly, are not immediately elevated from Acute
Myocardial Infarction. Elevation of the cardiac enzymes can be delayed for up to eight (8) to
twelve (12) hours after the onset of symptoms. Thus, the single set of cardiac enzymes tested for

in this matter was not enough to exclude any cardiac pathology where such a short time elapsed

between the onset of chest pain and the cardiac enzymes’ test. The cardiac enzymes’ test should
have been repeated at least once, if not several, times to be certain that there was no sign of cardiac
necrosis. As aresult, Patient A's condition warranted admission to the hospital specifically for this
purpose. Patient A required at least another five (5) hours in the hospital in order to allow for a
correct diagnosis.

10. Patient A appeared to improve, however, and was discharged at 4:45 p.m. No
further laboratory tests were performed prior to his discharge from the ER.

Count I

11. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

12. | Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of
a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

13. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

14. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under the same or similar circumstances when she failed to order a repeat EKG in the face of
stuttering chest pain and/or failed to admit Patient A to the hospital for the required time frame in
order to run a second set of cardiac enzymes tests.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against her and give her notice that she may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service
of the Complaint.

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a

formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS §630.339(3);

Respondent its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the
