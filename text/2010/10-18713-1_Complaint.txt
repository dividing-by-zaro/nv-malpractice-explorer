EXHIBIT
BEFORE THE
NORTH CAROLINA MEDICAL BOARD

In re:
NOTICE OF CHARGES

AND ALLEGATIONS;
NOTICE OF HEARING

Pamela Simone Gabriel, M.D.,


Respondent.

The North Carolina Medical Board ("Board") has preferred
and does hereby prefer the following charges and allegations:

1. The Board is a body duly organized under the laws of
North Carolina and is the proper party to bring this proceeding
under the authority granted it in Article 1 of Chapter 90 of the
North Carolina General Statutes.

2. Pamela Simone Gabriel (“Dr. Gabriel) is a physician
first licensed to practice medicine and surgery on September 19,
1998, license number 9801270.

3. During the times relevant herein, Dr. Gabriel
practiced medicine in Nevada.

4. In or about July 2008, the Board received information
that Dr. Gabriel had five malpractice settlement payments made
on her behalf. Dr. Gabriel however only disclosed one payment
on her 2008 annual renewal form.

5. On July 29, 2008, the Board sent a letter to Dr.

Gabriel at her last known home address requesting information

Notice of Charges ~ Pamela Simone Gabriel, M.D. Page 1 of 6
regarding the five malpractice payments. Dr. Gabriel did not
respond to this letter.

6. On September 9, 2008, the Board sent a second letter to
Dr. Gabriel at her last known home address by certified mail

again requesting that she provide information about the five

malpractice settlements. This letter was returned to the Board
unopened.
7. On October 7, 2008, a third letter was sent to Dr.

Gabriel at her last known office address by certified mail.
This letter asked Dr. Gabriel to provide information about the
five malpractice settlements. The return receipt was signed by
Dr. Gabriel on October 10, 2008. The Board, however, never
received a response from Dr. Gabriel by the due date contained
in the letter.

8. On October 6, 2008, prior to the third letter being
received by Dr. Gabriel, Board staff called Dr. Gabriel and left
a message for Dr. Gabriel. On October 7, 2008, Dr. Gabriel
returned the call and said that she would be sending in a
response. However, the Board never received a response.

9. On November 13 and November 26, 2008, Board staff sent
Dr. Gabriel an email requesting a response to the malpractice

payments. Again, no response was ever provided by Dr. Gabriel.

Notice of Charges - Pamela Simone Gabriel, M.D. Page 2 of 6
10. On December 10, 2008, Board staff called Dr. Gabriel at
her office, her home, and sent her an email, yet never received
a response.

11. On December 10, 2008, the Board staff sent yet another
certified letter to Dr. Gabriel’s home and office addresses.
Both return receipts were returned to the Board indicating that
Dr. Gabriel received both letters.

12. At present, the Board has received no response from Dr.
Gabriel regarding her malpractice payments.

13. Dr. Gabriel’s conduct, as described above, constitutes
unprofessional conduct, including, but not limited to, departure
from, or the failure to conform to, the standards of acceptable
and prevailing medical practice, or the ethics of the medical
profession, irrespective of whether or not a patient is injured
thereby, or the committing of any act contrary to honesty,
justice, or good morals, whether the same is committed in the
course of the physician's practice or otherwise, and whether
committed within or without North Carolina, within the meaning
of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 90-14(a) (6), and grounds exist under that
section of the North Carolina General Statutes for the Board to
annul, suspend, revoke, or limit Dr. Gabriel's license to
practice medicine issued by the Board or to deny any application

she might make in the future.

Notice of Charges —- Pamela Simone Gabriel, M.D. Page 3 of 6
14. Dr. Gabriel’s conduct, as described above, constitutes
a failure to respond, within a reasonable period of time and in
a reasonable manner as determined by the Board, to inquiries
from the Board concerning any matter affecting the license to
practice medicine within the meaning of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 90-
14(a) (14), and grounds exist under that section of the North
Carolina General Statutes for the Board to annul, suspend,
revoke, or limit Dr. Gabriel's license to practice medicine
issued by the Board or to deny any application she might make in
the future. |

15. By disclosing only one malpractice payments on her 2008
annual license renewal form, instead of all five malpractice
payments, Dr. Gabriel made false statements or representations
to the Board, or willfully concealed from the Board material
information in connection with an annual registration of a
license within the meaning of N.C. Gen. Stat. § 90-14(a) (3), and
grounds exist under that section of the North Carolina General
Statutes for the Board to annul, suspend, revoke, or limit Dr.
Gabriel's license to practice medicine issued by the Board or to
deny any application she might make in the future.

NOTICE TO DR. GABRIEL

Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 90-14.2, it is hereby ordered

that a hearing on the foregoing Notice of Charges and

The right to be present during the hearing of this case,
including any such right conferred or implied by N.C. Gen. Stat.

conducted, or are about to be conducted. In such event, the
