CLIFFORD CARROL, M.D., )


Respondent. )

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing was approved of Charles N. Held, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D. and
Ms. Valerie Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, having a reasonable basis to believe that Clifford Carrol,
M.D., hereinafter referred to as Dr. Carrol, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630,
hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations,
as follows:

1. Dr. Carrol is currently licensed in active status (License No. 8160), and has been so
licensed since April 21, 1997 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a forty-three year old male at the time of the incident in question. His
true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Dr. Carrol along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A was referred for a gastroenterology consultation by his primary care
physician in October 2004 after fecal occult blood testing showed positive findings.

4. Patient A was evaluated at the Gastroenterology Center of Nevada on December 6,
2004 by a provider other than Dr. Carrol. The impression noted in the medical record was

intermittent right upper quadrant pain and heme-positive stools and minimal constipation. A
colonoscopy was recommended and scheduled.

5. Patient A underwent a colonoscopy on January 28, 2005 at the Endoscopy Center
of Southern Nevada which was performed by Dr. Carrol. The medical records indicate the
procedure was started at 12:01 and was completed at 12:09. A specific time for the withdrawl of
the endoscope was not noted. Results of the colonoscopy were negative. In the records for the
colonoscopy, there is no mention of cecal intubation being achieved or that the appendiceal orifice
was identified. Photo documentation labeling of landmarks is lacking, specifically in the area in
which the cancerous lesion was subsequently identified. Additionally, there was no mention of a
retroflexing of the endoscope being performed.

6. Follow-up was not provided after the time of the normal examination to
specifically to evaluate the heme-positive stools for which Patient A was originally referred to the
Gastroenterology Center of Nevada.

7. Patient A was re-evaluated in April 2005 and was noted to be better with Citrucel
and was not experiencing rectal bleeding. The medical records indicated that the colonoscopy had
been negative and that right lower quadrant pain was resolved.

8. Patient A was admitted to North Valleys Hospital in December 2005 after a CBC
test ordered by his primary care physician indicated profound anemia. A gastrointestinal work up
was initiated while the patient was in the hospital which was negative. He was discharged with
instructions to follow up with his physicians.

9. He was seen at the Gastroenterology Center of Nevada shortly after his hospital
stay and was scheduled for a video capsule endoscopy which was performed in January 2006. The
actual capsule endoscopy report, apparently interpreted by Dr. Carrol indicated that the exam was
normal, however a handed follow-up visit notation indicates that it was abnormal.

10. Another colonoscopy, performed by Dr. Carrol on January 20, 2006, discovered a
large friable semicircular mass lesion just distal to the ileocecal valve. Biopsies were taken at the
time which indicated stage IV colon cancer. Several polyps were not identified; one polyp being

one centimeter from the mass. There was also poor documentation in regard to the exact location
of the lesion when compared to the pathology report.
Count 1

11. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of
a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

12. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

13. Dr. Carrol failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when he performed the colonoscopies. The documentation of the
both colonoscopies is poor and does not indicate that thorough and complete examinations were
completed during the endoscopies. Further, he failed to provide reasonable care for subsequent
follow-up of the heme-positive stool which led to Patient A’s original referral and colonoscopy.

14. By reason of the foregoing, Dr. Carrol is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Dr. Carrol notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service
of the Complaint.

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a
formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
determines to impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical
Practice Act (Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 630) committed by Dr. Carrol; and

4. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Dr. Carrol its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions

imposed; and
