at the time of filing of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and

Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 6453), and has been
50 licensed since March 21, 1992 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Sometime in 2004, Respondent and his radiology service, West Valley Imaging
Limited Partnership, were investigated by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of
Inspector General for Medicare billing fraud. The investigation led to formal charges being filed
against Respondent in 2005. The investigation subsequently continued, and negotiations ensued.
Negotiations proceeded and culminated in a settlement agreement executed by Respondent on
March 12, 2009.
