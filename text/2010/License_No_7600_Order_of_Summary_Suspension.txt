ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION

On April 8, 2010, Board Staff presented evidence and information to the Investigative
Committee, composed of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chair, Theodore Berndt, M.D., Member, and
Ms. Valerie Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, regarding Yvonne Barry, M.D. Upon review of
the evidence and information presented by Board Staff, the Investigative Committee hereby
IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDS the license to practice medicine of Dr. Yvonne Barry (hereinafter
“Dr. Barry’) pursuant to NRS 630.326(1) based upon the following preliminary findings:

1. Dr. Barry is a physician license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada and was
originally licensed on October 26, 1995. Dr. Barry’s known address and last known place of work
are located in Las Vegas, Nevada.

2. Through investigation it was discovered that Dr. Barry had a history of problems with
alcohol and prescription medications and that there were on-going concerns regarding her possible
usage of prescription medications and/or alcohol. The investigation also revealed that Dr. Barry had
been writing fraudulent prescriptions for medications for others but in reality would pick up the
prescriptions for her own use.

3. In 2009, Dr. Barry was encouraged several times to voluntarily enter into a
rehabilitation treatment program, however she failed to do so. On November 3, 2009, Dr. Barry was
ordered by the Investigative Committee to present to Larry Espadero, LADC of PRN at Montevista
Hospital for an assessment and entry into a five-year contract for drug and/or alcohol treatment and

monitoring.



4. Dr. Barry did present to Larry Espadero and entered into a contract for treatment on
November 6, 2009. As part of the contract terms, Dr. Barry agreed to participate in Peer Group
Counseling. Additionally Dr. Barry agreed to provide random drug screens at the discretion of the
PRN-PRN Advisory Committee.

5. Dr. Barry was non-compliant with the terms of her contract in December 2009 and in
January 2010 in that she had not attended PRN group meetings and had not provided urine samples
as required. On February 5, 2010, the Investigative Committee ordered that Dr. Barry comply with
each and every term included in her drug and/or alcohol treatment and monitoring contract with
PRN absent extraordinary circumstances.

6. Although Dr. Barry did comply with the terms of her contract for a short time, on
April 7, 2010, Board Staff was notified that Dr. Barry failed to show for a urine screen on April 5,
2010 and failed to show for a scheduled meeting with her monitor, Larry Espadero, LADC on April
6, 2010.

The Investigative Committee believes that due to Dr. Barry’s known issues with drugs and/or
alcohol and her continued pattern of non-compliance with her treatment contract and her
unwillingness to address her drug and/or alcohol problems that the health, safety and welfare of the
public is at imminent risk of harm and that a summary suspension of Dr. Barry’s medical license is
necessary to remove said risk of imminent harm to the health, safety and welfare of the public.
Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada of
Yvonne Barry, M.D., (License No. 7600) is hereby suspended until further order of the Investigative
Committee or Board; and

Ml
Ml




IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing be set within forty-five (45) days of this Order
regarding this matter pursuant to NRS 630.326(2) unless the parties mutually agree to a longer

period of time.

DATED this 8 "Gay of April, 2010.
