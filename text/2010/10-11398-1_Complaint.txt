MEDICAL EXAMINERS

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and
Valerie J. Clark, Member, having a reasonable basis to believe that William Smith, M.D.,
hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby
issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as
follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 7897), and has been
so licensed since July 7, 1996 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a forty-five year old (45) male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A suffered from a kyphoscoliosis deformity with partial paraplegia and
chronic intractable pain. The kyphotic deformity was of the thoracolumbar spine from T10-L3.

4. Respondent recommended anterior-posterior T10-L3 surgery. Patient A was
informed of the potential outcomes of the surgery, including paraplegia, and consented.

5. Patient A underwent surgery on September 29, 2004. The surgery was complex,
and the situation was difficult. Surgery proceeded without too much incident. It was the post-
operative care that fell below the standard of care.

6. A post-operative CT scan was done on September 30, 2004. The radiologist
admitted that it was hard to evaluate because of post-operative changes, likely metallic artifact. A
possible breach of the canal from a thoracic pedicle screw was also mentioned. Additionally, this
CT scan was a plain scan without intrathecal contrast. That made reading it difficult.

7. Days after the surgery, Patient A was found to have lost motor function in his lower
extremities having sensory preservation. An imaging study should have been performed
previously to assess for cord compression.

8. Either a thoracolumbar myelogram or an MRI study should have been used to
assess for possibilities of an epidural hematoma or some other reason to account for Patient A's
neurologic deterioration. Had such pathology been identified, Patient A should have been returned
immediately to the operating room for repair.

9. Alternatively, as Patient A deteriorated neurologically, Respondent should have
taken Patient A back to the operating room for exploration and discovery of the underlying
pathology. Consideration should have also been given to a return to surgery to release the
distraction on the cord. This was not done at any time.

Count I

10. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

11. | Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of
a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

12. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

13. | Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used

under the same or similar circumstances when he failed and omitted to utilize available and

appropriate post-operative imaging, or alternatively, failed to return Patient A to the operating
room after he was found to be significantly neurologically worse after the operation.

14. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service
of the Complaint.

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a
formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS §630.339(3);

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
determines to impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical
Practice Act (Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 630) committed by Respondent; and

4, That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Respondent its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the
sanctions imposed; and

5. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners take such other and further
action as may be just and proper in these premises.
