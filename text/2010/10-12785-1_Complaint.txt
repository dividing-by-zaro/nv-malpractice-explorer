The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),
composed of Charles N. Held, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., and Ms. Renee West, by and
through Edward O. Cousineau, General Counsel for the Board and Attorney for the Investigative

Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1, Respondent was licensed in active status to practice medicine in the State of
Nevada on August 17, 1999, and was so licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of
Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. On or about June 13, 2007, the Board received Respondent’s Application for
Registration Renewal of License for the 2007-2009 biennial registration period. One of the
questions in the Application asked, “Are you out of compliance with court ordered child support?”
Respondent answered in the negative.

3. On or about June 19, 2009, the Board received Respondent’s Application for
Registration Renewal of License for the 2009-2011 biennial registration period. One of the
questions in the Application asked, “Are you out of compliance with court ordered child support?”

was in arrears, and not in compliance, with a court ordered child support obligation which
originated out of the state of California. In June of 2007, Respondent’s child support arrearages
totaled $7,255.86, and in June of 2009, Respondent’s child support arrearages totaled $10,131.05.

2009 or 2009-2011 Registration Renewal of Licensure Applications that he was in arrears and out
of compliance with a court ordered child support obligation.

6. Section 630.304(1) of the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) provides that obtaining,
maintaining or renewing or attempting to obtain, maintain or renew a license to practice medicine
by bribery, fraud or misrepresentation or by any false, misleading, inaccurate or incomplete

that he was out of compliance with his court ordered child support obligation, and is subject to
discipline by the Board as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1, That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing;
