On May 5, 2010, Board Staff presented evidence and information to the Investigative
Committee, composed of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chair, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and
Valerie Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, regarding Joel Washinsky, M.D. Upon review of the
evidence and information presented by Board Staff, the Investigative Committee hereby
IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDS the license to practice medicine of Dr. Joel Washinsky (hereinafter
“Dr. Washinsky”) pursuant to NRS 630.326(1) based upon the following preliminary findings:

1. Dr. Washinsky is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada and
was originally licensed on December 2, 1989. Dr. Washinsky resides and practices medicine in th¢
Las Vegas area. His primary specialty is listed with the Board as internal medicine.

2. Through investigation it was discovered that on April 20, 2010, Dr. Washinsky was
arrested by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department in conjunction with the Nevada
Department of Public Safety for sixty-seven (67) felony counts of dispensing controlled substance$
and/or prescriptions without a license. Dr. Washinsky is currently not in custody.

3. During the arrest of Dr. Washinsky he admitted to taking Clonazepam and Lorazepam!
both schedule IV controlled substances, on a continuing basis, without a prescription for said
substances and indicated that he may have a dependence on said substances.

4. On April 27, 2010, Dr. Washinsky was served with an Order from this Investigative
Committee ordering him to submit to a urine and hair drug screen and ordering him to complete an
evaluation for drug and/or alcohol dependency with Larry Espardaro at the PRN/PRN of Nevada

5. Dr. Washinsky did submit to the urine and hair drug screen as ordered on April 27
2010. The results from the hair test were positive for opiates, specifically hydrocodone at
>2000 pg/mg. The cut off for the positive test is 100 pg/mg. The urine results are still pending.

6. On May 3, 2010, Dr. Washinsky did appear for the ordered evaluation with Larry
Espadaro of PRN/PRN of Nevada. At the time of the evaluation, Mr. Espardaro required
Dr. Washinsky to submit to a urine drug screen. The urine screen indicated Dr. Washinsky positive
for opiates.

7. During his evaluation with Mr. Espardaro, Dr. Washinsky indicated that he prescribed
for himself and that he had no prescribing physician at the time of the interview.

The Investigative Committee believes that due to Dr. Washinsky’s continuing use of opiates
without a prescription from a physician as evidence by both a positive hair and urine screen, his
admitted use of benzodiazepines without a prescription and his alleged conduct of dispensing
prescription drugs without a license, that the health, safety and welfare of the public is at imminent
risk of harm and that a summary suspension of Dr. Washinsky’s medical license is necessary td
remove said risk of imminent harm to the health, safety and welfare of the public. Accordingly
pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada of
Joel Washinsky, M.D., (License No. 5955) is hereby suspended until further order of the Investigative
Committee or Board; and

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing be set within forty-five (45) days of this Order
regarding this matter pursuant to NRS 630.326(2) to determine whether this suspension may continue
unless the parties mutually agree to a longer period of time.

DATED this 4 day of May, 2010.
