ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION

On May 27, 2010, Board Staff presented evidence and information to the Investigative
Committee, composed of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Chair, Mr. Van Heffner, Member, and
Beverly Neyland, M.D., Member, regarding Diane Ruhl, P.A.-C. Upon review of the evidence and
information presented by Board Staff, the Investigative Committee hereby IMMEDIATELY
SUSPENDS the license to practice medicine as a physician assistant of Diane Ruhl, P.A.-C
(hereinafter “Ms. Ruhl’) pursuant to NRS 630.326(1) based upon the following preliminary
findings:

1. Ms. Ruhl is licensed to practice medicine as a physician assistant in the state of
Nevada and was originally licensed on March 6, 1993. As of May 26, 2010, Ms. Ruhl’s license
status is “active-not working.”

2. Ms. Ruhl was employed by Huntridge Teen Clinic between September 2006 and
April 2009. It is believed that Ms. Ruhl possessed an unknown quantity of blank prescription pads
from the clinic at the time of her departure and still maintains possession of said prescription pads.
Ms. Ruhl did write some prescriptions on at least one prescription pad from Huntridge Teen Clinic
after the end of her employment there.

3, Ms. Ruhl was employed by and practiced at the offices of Dr. Deanna Lee between
April 2009 and April 8, 2010 when her employment was terminated. It is believed that at the time

of her departure she had in her possession an unknown quantity of blank prescription pads.


\O


4. Through investigation it was discovered that Ms. Ruhl had written multiple
prescriptions for controlled substances for P.S. and W. F. between 2006 and April 2010. Neither
P.S. nor W.F. were bona fide patients of Ms. Ruhl or Dr. Lee and Ms. Ruhl and been told in the fall
of 2009 that she was not to write prescriptions for P.S., however, she continued to do so. Ms. Ruhl
completed no examinations of either P.S, or W.F and did not maintain any medical records for either
P.S. or W.F.

5. Through further investigation it was discovered that Ms. Ruhl wrote multiple
prescriptions for controlled substances on the prescription pads from Dr. Lee’s office for multiple
individuals for whom there are is record of ever being seen at Dr. Lee’s office by Dr. Lee or
Ms. Ruhl.

6. On April 1, 2010, Ms. Ruhl was interviewed by Las Vegas Metro at which time she
denied writing prescriptions to W.F.

7. Ms. Ruhl was again interviewed on April 8, 2010 by Las Vegas Metro at which time
she did admit to writing the prescriptions for controlled substances for both P.S. and W. F. and that
she had not examined W.F. There is no evidence to suggest that she examined P.S. either.

The Investigative Committee believes that due to Ms. Ruhl’s unlawful and continued pattern
of writing prescriptions for controlled substances for P.S., W.F. and multiple other individuals for
their use and/or her personal use without a bona fide patient relationship with these individuals and
outside the normal scope of her practice, and due to her recent denial and subsequent admission to
writing the prescriptions for P.S. and W.F. and due to the possibility that Ms. Ruhl still has access
to blank prescription pads, that the health, safety and welfare of the public is at imminent risk of
harm and that a summary suspension of Ms. Ruhl’s license to practice medicine as a physician
assistant is necessary to remove said risk of imminent harm to the health, safety and welfare of the
public. Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the license to practice medicine as a physician assistant in
the state of Nevada of Diane Ruhl, P.A.-C, (License No. 401) is hereby suspended until further order

of the Investigative Committee or Board; and


Co


IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing be set within forty-five (45) days of this Order
regarding this matter pursuant to NRS 630.326(2) to determine the appropriateness of this

suspension, unless the parties mutually agree to a longer period of time.

DATED this 27th day of May, 2010.
