MEDICAL EXAMINERS

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and
Valerie J. Clark, Member, having a reasonable basis to believe that James Lee Unger, M.D.,
hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby
issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as
follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 4223), and has been
so licensed since January 1, 1981 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a thirty year old (30) female at the time of the incidents in question.
Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On November 4, 2008, Respondent diagnosed a cervical biopsy from Patient A. He
found it to be malignant.

4. As a result and based upon the malignant diagnosis, Patient A underwent a
hysterectomy. Following the hysterectomy, the diagnosis of Patient A was amended to a benign

diagnosis of squamous dysplasia rather than invasive carcinoma.

5. The records indicate that Respondent had paperwork belonging to Patient A and the
pathology slide belonging to another patient. That patient's slide was a malignant diagnosis but
was given to Patient A, who in reality had a benign cervix and related slide.

6. The diagnosis was incorrectly given to Patient A as named in the paperwork rather
than the patient named on the slide. Respondent failed to correlate the correct paperwork with the
slide information. The paperwork had been switched from one tray to another.

7. Had Respondent recognized the discrepancy, the misdiagnosis would have been
avoided. Significantly, had the misdiagnosis been avoided, Patient A would not have had the

unnecessary hysterectomy.

Count I
8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.
9. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of

a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

10. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

11. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under the same or similar circumstances when he failed and omitted to correlate the name on the
pathology slide with the name to which the diagnosis is assigned as indicated by the paperwork.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service
of the Complaint.

formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS §630.339(3);

Respondent its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the

action as may be just and proper in these premises.
