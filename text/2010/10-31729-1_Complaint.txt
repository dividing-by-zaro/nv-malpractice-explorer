COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Chairman, Van V. Heffner, Member, and Beverly A. Neyland,
M.D., Member, by and through Bradley O. Van Ry, Deputy General Counsel for the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners, having a _ reasonable basis to _ believe that
Sean Beaty, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Dr. Beaty, has violated the provisions of
NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Dr. Beaty is currently licensed in active status, and was so licensed by the Nevada
State Board of Medical Examiners, on May 18, 2006 (License No. 11844), pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and at all times addressed herein was
so licensed.

2. Patient A was a sixty-six year old (66) female at the time of the incidents in question.
Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Dr. Beaty along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A underwent an outpatient upper endoscopy and colonoscopy on
September 7, 2006 performed by another physician. After the procedure, that physician

recommended that Patient A go to Sunrise Hospital for a bartum enema.

4. Patient A went to Sunrise Hospital for the barium enema to be performed by
Dr. Beatty on the same day. Prior to the barium enema, a "scout film" (x-ray) was taken per standard
procedures. The "scout film" (x-ray) showed extra luminal gas. Dr. Beaty failed to review the "scout
film" x-ray until after the barium enema procedure. This extra luminal gas would have Jed Dr. Beaty
to immediately inform the referring physician of a suspected colonic perforation and not proceed
with the barium enema. Unfortunately, this never took place and the barium enema proceeded.

5. As the procedure progressed, the barium enema began to seep into the peritoneum
from a perforation in the colon. The barium procedure was halted, and the ordering physician was
notified. It is believed that the colonic perforation was not caused by Dr. Beaty.

6. The barium leakage led to massive internal injuries that required two (2) abdominal
surgeries, a colostomy, caused respiratory failure, and a spleenectomy. Patient A remained in the
hospital from September 7, 2006 until October 7, 2006. Then she was confined in Rehabilitation
Hospital of Las Vegas from October 7, 2006 to October 26, 2006. Finally, she was in Kindred
Hospital of Las Vegas from October 26, 2006 to November 10, 2006.

7. Dr. Beaty never reviewed the "scout film" (x-ray) before the procedure. He did,
however, review the "scout film" (x-ray) after the barium enema and observed that free air was seen
and not appreciated prior to the administration of the barium enema. If Dr. Beaty had reviewed the
film prior to the administration of the barium enema, he would have likely decided upon further
diagnostic exams before proceeding.

Count I

8. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of
a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

9, Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

10. Dr. Beaty failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under the same or similar circumstances when he failed and omitted to review the "scout film"

(x-ray) prior to performing a barium enema on Patient A.

11. By reason of the foregoing, Dr. Beaty is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Dr. Beaty notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service
of the Complaint.

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a
formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
determines to impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical
Practice Act (Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 630) committed by Dr. Beaty; and

4, That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Dr. Beaty its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions
imposed; and

5. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners take such other and further

action as may be just and proper in these premises.
