COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Member, and
Valerie J. Clark, Member, having a_ reasonable basis to believe that
Stuart Michael Hoffman, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the provisions
of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 9758), and has been
so licensed since April 23, 2001 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a forty-one year old (41) male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On June 10, 2005, Patient A presented with classic symptoms of cholecystitis or
abdominal pain and vomiting. Respondent performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on
Patient A.

4, Two days after the surgery, Patient A began to suffer increasing abdominal pain

and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The abdominal pain continued, and a CT scan of

Patient A's abdomen was performed on day three after surgery. An extensive amount of ascites
and a probable ventral hematoma were identified.

5. Patient A remained in the hospital and by day five after the surgery began to suffer
rising insulin requirements. This was a very unusual symptom for a routine laparoscopic
cholecystectomy.

6. Patient A continued to worsen. Pain medication was given, and Patient A was
fatigued and dizzy, exhibited a pulse rate of 125-140 and poor glucose control noted.

7. The pain continued, and an ERCP was performed and stenting added in order to
relieve a questionable bile leak on day twelve after the original surgery.

8. By post-operative day 15, Patient A continued with increasing pain, and pain
medication was prescribed. Patient A's heart rate was noted as 140. Increasing distension of the
abdomen was taking place, and acute renal failure began.

9. On post-operative day 16, a critical care consult took place. Massive ascites were
noted and a questionable diagnosis of biliary peritonitis was made. Patient A was admitted to
intensive care. Paracentesis was performed that removed 4 liters of bile.

10. On post-operative day 18, Patient A underwent another surgery, a laparotomy and
drainage. Diffuse reactive bowel peritonitis with multiple areas of fibrinous exudate was found.
A #10 Jackson-Pratt drain was left in the gall bladder for drainage.

11. Patient A ultimately recovered and was discharged on July 11, 2005, thirty-one
days after the laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He had acquired a MRSA infection while in the
hospital and continued on vancomycin as an outpatient.

12. Patient B was a forty-nine (49) year old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

13. Patient B was admitted for chest pain on January 19, 2007. An ultrasound of her
gall bladder was positive for stones. A cystic duct obstruction was also found.

14. A laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed on January 23, 2007.

15. On post-operative day one, Patient B had increased liver function tests and
increased abdominal pain with increased white count. Her temperature was 100 and urinary
output was low. All of these findings were very abnormal for a routine laparoscopic
cholecystectomy post-operative day one.

16. On January 25, 2007 and post-operative day two, Patient B suffered significant
abdominal pain. Her heart rate climbed to 120. Her total bilirubin was rising, BUN 31, creatinine
1.5 all suggesting some acute renal failure and volume depletion.

17. The internal medicine physician was concerned about the abdomen and belly
tenderness and guarding with decreased bowel sounds. But Respondent refused to get a CT scan
of the abdomen and pelvis at this time.

18. Cardiology, renal and pulmonary consults were obtained that same day. The
increased heart rate and blood pressure were believed to be secondary to pain. The patient was
transferred to intermediate care and her fluids were increased.

19. Pain management was increased due to increasing abdominal pain on
January 26, 2007. Her abdomen was noted as diffusely tender on deep palpation.

20. ACT scan was finally performed due to Patient B's progressive downward course
on January 28, 2007. A duodenal rupture was identified. Respondent was notified of the CT scan
results.

21. Respondent then performed the surgery. He noted that the edges of the duodenal
injury were quite friable but still closed the defect any way. JP drains were added to get control of
the leakage. This was not very successful. No attempt at diversion was made, and no attempt to
place a feeding tube was made.

22. Patient B then underwent a prolonged and difficult post-operative course. During
the course of the post-operative development, she developed enterocutaneous fistulas and multiple
percutaneous drainages due to poor drainage of the duodenal fistula.

23. Patient B even required CT guided drainage on February 10, 2007. Further
interventional radiology helped obtain adequate drainage, and she was discharged on

May 17, 2007. This was four months after the initial laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

24. Patient C was a fifty-nine (59) year old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

25. Patient C was admitted for abdominal pain on June 16, 2005. This admission
followed a laparoscopic sigmoid resection that was still causing pain.

26. The initial assessment was of potential peptic ulcer disease. An acid reducer, PPI,
was prescribed. An EGD showed a hiatal hernia and some antral gastropathy on June 19, 2005.

27. A HIDA scan showed normal post-laparoscopic cholecystecomy with no evidence
of a bile leak despite that no laparoscopic cholecystecomy was ever performed. This changed
Respondent's diagnosis to acute cholecystitis that now required a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on
June 20, 2005.

28. The gastroenterologist noted that the HIDA scan was questionably abnormal. She
wished to discuss this with the radiologist. This never took place.

29. On June 22, 2005, the laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. The
pathology report, however, came back a little strange. It showed acute and chronic serositis and
peritonitis with minimal chronic inflammation and no gall stones. This was an odd pathology
report for a gall bladder removal.

30. Two days later, on June 24, 2005, Patient C's temperature was noted at 101.7. Her
abdomen was softly distended.

31. She began vomiting the next day, on June 25, 2005, and her temperature was noted
at 102 the following day, June 26, 2005. Her abdomen was very soft, and a CT scan of the
abdomen and pelvis was ordered to rule out an abscess. The CT scan showed moderate ascites
and left hydronephrosis of uncertain etiology. This was missed by Respondent and was of medical
significance.

32, Her temperature continued for a couple more days. She began to suffer from
diarrhea on June 28, 2005.

33. Patient C continued in the hospital. Her temperature continued to be high. It was
measured at 101 on July 2, 2005. Her abdomen was soft with mild tenderness diffusely. Her
condition continued as mentioned for several more days.

34. On July 6, 2005, her abdomen was again noted to be soft. Her fever increased to
102.9 on July 7, 2005. A CT scan was ordered that showed a pelvic abscess. CT guided drainage
was performed that drained about 200 cc of serosanguinous fluid. The fluid was not pus and did
not appear to be an abscess by description of the fluid.

35. Patient C's fevers continued and spiked to 104 on July 8, 2005. The drain started to
be high output. This was very odd for drainage of a simple post-operative abscess. The infectious
disease specialist questioned whether the fevers were secondary to an abscess or questionable
bowel leak on July 9, 2005.

36. On July 10, 2005, the gastroenterologist noted that the pelvic abscess is high output
of clear fluid that may be a urinary fistula. He ordered a creatinine on the drainage output. The
creatinine was elevated on the fluid, so it was clear that Patient C had a urinary fistula. A possible
bladder injury was suspected. A left ureteral injury was suspected as well. This diagnosis should
have been made much earlier. The June 26, 2005 CT scan showed the left hydronephrosis that
should have been followed up on and would have led to the correct diagnosis.

37. On July 13, 2005, Patient C underwent a left nephrostomy tube placement with
ultrasound guidance. The left ureter was noted as obstructed. The obstruction was most likely
secondary from the previous sigmoid resection which was the very reason Patient C was admitted
on June 16, 2005 in the first place.

38. Finally, on July 30, 2005, a left ureteral repair was performed. The proper
diagnosis led to the proper surgical repair. Patient C was discharged home on August 10, 2005.

39. Patient D was a seventy-one (71) year old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

40. Patient D was admitted for a two week history of hematemesis and melena on
December 29, 2006. A prior CT scan showed a gastric wall thickness involving the antrum and
pylorus with numerous sub-centimeter hypo-attenuating liver lesions.

41. On December 31, 2006, Respondent noted the gastric mass, GI bleed with anemia,
likely adenocarcinoma. Surgery was scheduled for January 3, 2007.

42. An EGD biopsy showed mild chronic gastritis, neutrophilic fibrinous exudates
consistent with the surface of an ulcer. There was no evidence of cancer in the pathology
specimen. The pathology report states that the etiology of the ulcer cannot be determined from the
sample and that surgery is planned for diagnosis and treatment.

43. On January 3, 2007, Respondent performed surgery on Patient D. Respondent
found a large mass involving and extending through the pylorus into the first portion of the
duodenum. The tissue appeared to be chronically inflamed with a mass adhered to the gallbladder,
liver and periportal structures.

44. After extensive surgery and dissection of much of the stomach and pancreas, a
gastrojejunostomy and a side-to-side choledochojejunostomy was performed by Respondent. No
mention of any frozen sections being performed to determine whether this was a carcinoma or not.
Additionally, no liver biopsy was performed despite the previous CT scan demonstrating multiple
lesions in the liver.

45. Patient D was placed on a ventilator and was admitted to the ICU. She remained in
the ICU and continued to worsen.

46. On January 6, 2007, Patient D was re-intubated. The renal consult found that the
acute renal failure was stable, but noted possible sepsis of abdominal origin. He wished to order a
CT with IV contrast.

47. Respondent found that Patient D's hemoglobin was 9.2, hematocrit 26.7 and white
cell count 14.5. Despite this, Respondent thought that Patient D was having a post-operative MI
or PE, and he canceled the abdominal CT scan.

48. Patient D remained severely acidotic with apparent sepsis. Yet, no further

comment was made by Respondent as to a possible abdominal origin for the sepsis.

49, On January 8, 2007, Patient D remained intubated and in critical condition.
Respondent asked for another CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.

50. On January 9, 2007, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. Several
fluid collections were identified in the pelvis extending around the right kidney towards the
porta hepatic. Patient D continued to deteriorate clinically with a heart rate in the 120-170s on
multiple pressors.

51. She remained critical through January 10, 2007. Due to the poor prognosis and
continued critical status, the family wished life-support withdrawn.

52. Patient D died on January 11, 2007.
