Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 7991), and has been
so licensed since September 26, 1996 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant
to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Respondent’s authorized billing network contract with CIGNA Healthcare

CIGNA for medical services after that date.

3. Beginning on or about August 20, 2003 and continuing through
December 31, 2004, Respondent performed medical services and billed CIGNA for medical
services although not authorized to do so. He did this by using his partner’s, and ex-wife’s name,
Dr. Miroslava Mogler hereinafter referred to as “Dr. Mogler”, and billing authorization number

with CIGNA to submit the bills to CIGNA. Thus, on multiple instances and over the course of
