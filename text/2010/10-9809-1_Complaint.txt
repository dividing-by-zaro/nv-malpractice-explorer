1. Respondent was actively licensed to practice medicine by the Board on
July 1, 1988, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and at all
times addressed herein was so licensed. Respondent’s indicated specialties to the Board are
surgery and critical care.

2. On February 23, 2010, at approximately 4:00 p.m., Respondent was scheduled to
perform a lypoma removal surgical procedure at Valley Hospital in Las Vegas. During the
preliminary stages of the procedure, individuals involved on the surgical team noted Respondent
appeared impaired. Additionally, the odor of alcohol was noted on Respondent’s breath.

3. Based upon the foregoing, Valley Hospital administration was contacted.
Administration then directed Respondent to cease the surgical procedure, leave the operating

room, and requested that Respondent submit to blood alcohol and urine toxicology screenings.

consumed alcohol with his lunch. Shortly thereafter, Respondent was informed medical staff
privileges at Valley Hospital were summarily suspended to reduce any likelihood of immediate
danger to the health and safety of the Hospital’s patients.

5. At approximately 5:00 p.m. that same day, Respondent provided both blood and
urine samples, the subsequent results of which showed an ethanol (alcohol) concentration of 0.06
g/dL, (%) in Respondent’s system.
