Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(“Board”) hereby issues this formal Complaint against Neri M. Blanco-Cuevas, M.D. (hereinafter
referred to as Respondent), a physician licensed in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC
has a reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised
Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively,
the Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

l. Respondent is, and was at all times relevant to this case, a physician licensed to
practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10819). Respondent lists her scope of
practice as general surgery. Respondent was issued her license from the Board on February 26,
2004, pursuant to the provisions of NRS Chapter 630.

2. Patient A was a 64-year-old male at the time of the events at issue. His true
identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation
served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3: Patient A initially presented to Respondent’s office on or about June 29, 2015,
complaining of pain in his right hand. Respondent performed a brief physical examination and

history on Patient A, and documentation of the initial visit was brief. Under the heading of “Past

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, and Aury Nagy, M.D.

Surgical History,” Respondent wrote, “Multiple orthopedic surgeries.” Respondent diagnosed
Patient A with a right palmar mass, scar tissue, slightly painful with range of motion secondary to
mass effect, but no erythema, drainage, increased pain or finger tingling. Under the heading of
“Assessment/Plan,” Respondent wrote, “Right palmar Mass, Dupuytrens Contracture, Office Bx.”

4, Patient A presented back to Respondent’s office on July 27, 2015, for the
procedure. Respondent, in her notes, states the following: “Informed consent obtained. Patient
was sitting with hand on surgical table. Injected with lidocaine hand block. Prepped and draped.
Scalpel and curette used to debride, I&D, release scar tissue and tendons to 4rth finger. Good
hemostasis. Sterile dressings placed. Well Tolerated.”

5 Upon information and belief, Respondent abandoned the surgery in mid-procedure

for fear of potential damage.

6. On or about September 16, 2015, Patient A presented to a hand surgeon for his
right hand.
hs The new hand surgeon felt that surgery was required but needed to be delayed to

provide time for healing from the previous surgery performed by Respondent.

8. On or about April 6, 2016, Patient A was forced to undergo another surgery on his
right hand. The second surgery required a rather extensive fasciectomy with a complex flap
closure of the hand.

9. The IC reviewed the findings from an Independent Medical Expert (IME), who
reviewed the medical records and additional relevant documentation and opined that Respondent’s
acts and/or omissions violated the Medical Practice Act.

COUNT I
Failure to Maintain Timely, Legible, Accurate and Complete Medical Records

11. | NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient constitutes
grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

12. Respondent failed to maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete medical
records/notes relating to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of Patient A in pre-op and/or post-op
documentation, and did not get an informed consent in writing.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II

Practice Beyond Scope of License
NRS 630.306(1)(e)

14. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

15. NRS 630.306(1)(e) provides that practicing or offering to practice beyond the
scope permitted by law or performing services which the licensee knows or has reason to know
that he or she is not competent to perform or which are beyond the scope of his or her training
constitutes grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

16. | Dupuytren’s Contracture release requires a complex surgery, preferably at a well-
equipped hospital, not an outpatient office visit, for which the Respondent was woefully
underqualified.

17. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

19. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is an act, among others, that constitutes
grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

20. Malpractice is defined as "the failure of a physician, in treating a patient, to use the
reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances." NAC 630.040.

21. Respondent, including, but not limited to, did not do a thorough initial physical
examination, did not have the qualifications for this complex hand surgery, performed the surgery
in her office (rather than a well-equipped hospital), and abandoned the surgery in mid-procedure.

22. As a direct result of Respondent's failure to use reasonable care, skill, or
knowledge ordinarily used in the circumstances, Patient A was forced to undergo a second surgery
to address Respondent’s improperly performed hand surgery.

23. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

i That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
