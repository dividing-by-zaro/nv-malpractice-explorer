4. On August 25, 2012, Respondent, who had the responsibility to evaluate Patient

A’s eyes, noted in the medical records that he “completed a full physical examination” and

reviewed the work up from the ER with an understanding that Patient A presented with “left eye
pain” and a history of pseudotumor cerebri. Respondents impressions were pseudotumor cerebri,
hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea. A neurologist was consulted subsequently.

Respondent had a duty to perform an examination, including the conjunctiva, eye lids, and cornea,
with a simple fluorescein stain that would be necessary to diagnose and treat an eye infection,
prior to prescribing steroids for Patient A.

5. On August 26, 2012, Patient A was discharged with Respondent's prescribing
steroid prednisolone eye drops (Pred Forte) and ciprofloxacin ophthalmic drops for treatment for
his eyes and was instructed to follow up with an ophthalmologist the next day after discharge.

6. On May 13, 2013, Patient A required a comea transplant after suffering a severe
comea ulceration of the left eye, which was not diagnosed by Respondent during his “full physical
examination” on August 25, 2012.

7. Previous to the preparation of this Complaint, the Board solicited the services of an
independent medical expert (IME) to review Patient A’s medical records and the care provided to
such patient by Respondent. This IME opined that Respondent’s care of Patient A violated the
Medical Practice Act due to his acts and omissions when rendering care to Patient A.

Count

10. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

11. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed

to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when

he provided medical treatment to Patient A, because when Respondent, without ruling out a
herpetic or fungal infection during his full physical examination, started Patient A on the steroid
(prednisolone) drops he deviated from the appropriate standard of care, which requires the ruling
out of any opportunistic infections and failed to conduct a slip-lamp examination prior to treating
Patient A with steroid eye drops treatment.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

Count It
(Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records)

13. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

14. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds
for initiating discipline against a licensee.

15. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to document his actions when he treated Patient A,
whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

16. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give

within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;
