The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Roger R. Mehta, M.D. (Respondent), a
physician licensed in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a reasonable basis to
believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and
Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act). The IC
alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is licensed in Nevada in active status (License No. 14004) and was licensed by
the Board on July 6, 2011.

2. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in
the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On June 30, 2012, Patient A, a 57-old-year male with an initial complaint of a one-month
history of right hip pain radiating to the leg, was seen in urgent care, wherein an X-Ray was
ordered. Patient A was referred to Orthopedics. An MRI result led to an evaluation and a referral
to pain management. The patient was seen by Respondent, wherein labs were ordered, including
findings of an abnormal elevated liver function test. Patient A was told of a need to repeat the lab

test in a year. Patient A returned in three months with rapid weight loss and neurologic

' The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) at the time this formal

abnormality leading to an evaluation by a Neurologist, who ordered additional labs and MRIs.
Prior to Neurologist evaluation, Patient A was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with
metastatic cancer leading to admission to hospice.

4, On October 16, 2012, Patient A was seen by Respondent with a complaint of nocturia,
continued his treatment of lower back pain, requested a referral to physical therapy for knee pain,
and wanted medicine for insomnia. Patient A’s weight was 209 Ibs; Plan: PT referral, Trazodone;
Labs: ordered and returned-results were normal except AST 0, ALT 97, ALKP 132, PSA 4.2.

5. On October 18, 2012, Patient A was sent a letter, which stated the PSA was mildly
elevated — no action required and LFT elevated — not clinically significant — repeat in one year.

6. On December 17, 2012, Patient A was seen by Respondent with a complaint of rapid
weight loss, bilateral feet edema, and lethargy. Patient A’s was weight 200 Ibs — physical exam
was within normal limits except neurologic examination with a positive Romberg.

7. On December 26, 2012, pursuant to a previous referral, Patient A was seen by Neurologist
with progressive weight loss, leg weakness and gait difficulty. Reviewed labs: LFT elevated,
TSH, B12, CBC w/in limits.

8. On December 27, 2012, Patient A was admitted into St. Rose Siena with an inability to
stand for a prolonged time due to weakness and reported a 50ib. weight loss in two months.
Patient A was evaluated with continued elevated LFT. A CT scan of the head showed a
destructive bone lesion in the right frontal lobe — suspected metastatic disease. A CT scan of the
chest, abdomen and pelvis indicated a necrotic mass centered in the right kidney measuring
greater than 25 cm diameter, which encompassed the entire right kidney and suprarenal space,
invading the right hepatic lobe of the liver, porta hepaticus and pancreatic head. There was
continuous bulky retroperitonal adenopathy and an obstruction of the infra renal inferior vena
cava. Overall. the findings were most compatible with renal cell carcinoma.

9. Previous to the preparation of this Complaint, the Board solicited the services of an
independent medical expert (IME) to review Patient A’s medical records and the care provided to
such patient by Respondent. This IME opined that Respondent’s care of Patient A violated the

Medical Practice Act due to his acts and omissions when rendering care to Patient A.
