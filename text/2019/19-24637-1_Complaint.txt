“ILED
JAN 15 2019

Complaint Against
MICHELLE R. CLOUTHIER, RRT,

Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(“Board”) hereby issues this formal Complaint against Michelle R. Clouthier, RRT (hereinafter
referred to as Respondent), a licensed Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) in Nevada. After
investigating this matter, the IC has a reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

I. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. RC363). Respondent
was issued her license from the Board on December 14, 2001, pursuant to the provisions of NRS
Chapter 630.

2. Patient A was a 61-year-old female at the time of the events at issue. Her true
identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation
served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On or about November 15, 2014, Patient A, who was in critical condition and

recently intubated, was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) of Desert Springs

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D., Ms. Sandy Peltyn and Victor M. Muro,

M.D.

Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada. Patient A was then transported from the MICU to receive a CT
scan and back to the MICU on the same day.

4. Cynthia V. Ivey, CRT (Ms. Ivey) was the respiratory therapist assigned to
accompany Patient A and provide her respiratory expertise and necessary respiratory equipment to
ensure safe transport. Respondent and Ms. Ivey were coworkers and were both respiratory
therapists at Desert Springs Hospital.

5. Another medical provider was also assigned to accompany Patient A and provide
medical expertise, monitoring equipment and medications that may have been necessary to ensure
a safe transport.

6. Upon information and belief, during transport of Patient A back from the CT scan,
the supplemental oxygen supply apparently ran out and a manual resuscitation bag was not
available to continue necessary ventilation.

7. Following these events, Ms. Ivey failed to document this information in Patient A’s
medical records as required by NRS 630.3062(1)(a) at the end of her shift on November 15, 2014.

8. Two days later, on or about November 17, 2014, at the request and direction of Ms.
Ivey, Respondent made an entry into Patient A’s medical records using Ms. Ivey’s electronic
signature (logon ID and password), which Ms. Ivey provided to Respondent.

9. Ms. Ivey made that request to Respondent via text message to Respondent that
stated, “Pt. in MICU 10 add note for yesterday 5:30 pm that Patient desaturated on the way back
from CT bagged Patient till oxygen came back up then put patient back on vent.”

10. Respondent did not provide or observe the patient care of Patient A, provided by
Ms. Ivey, on or about November 15, 2014.

12. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient constitutes
grounds for initiating disciplinary action.

13. Respondent failed to maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete medical
records/notes relating to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of Patient A when she acquiesced to
Ms. Ivey’s direction and request to enter Ms. Ivey’s medical note two days after the event, when
Respondent did not witness the treatment of Patient A by Ms. Ivey.

14. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

by any false, misleading, inaccurate or incomplete statement constitutes grounds for initiating
disciplinary action.

17. Desert Springs Hospital investigated Respondent as a result of the events described
herein.

18. Respondent failed to disclose that Desert Springs Hospital investigated the events
contained herein when on Respondent’s 2015 renewal application, she answered “no” to the
question, “[h]ave you been: a) asked to respond to an investigation; b) notified that you were
under investigation for; c) investigated for; d) charged with; e) convicted of any violation of a
