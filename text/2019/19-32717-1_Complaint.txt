The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)

COMPLAINT

hereby issues this Complaint (Complaint) against Christina Lynne Kushnir, M.D. (Respondent), a
licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC' has a reasonable basis to
believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and
the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act). The
IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent was licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical
Practice Act, on June 7, 2012, and is currently licensed in active status (License No. 14396).

2. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On June 1, 2015, Patient A was seen at the Women’s Cancer Center of Nevada
(WCCN) for a fibroid uterus and pelvic pain. Previously, Patient A had two prior open
myomectemies, diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity and a known history of severe adhesive
disease (well-documented within Respondent’s notes and Valley Health Systems). Following a
discussion of the benefits/risks of surgery, Patient A consented for Respondent to perform an
exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

Patient A’s incision was closed with a monocryl suture when Respondent was present; however,

1 At the time filing of the Complaint was approved, the IC was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chairman, Mr.
M. Neil Duxbury and Aury Nagy, M.D.

when the tape was applied to Patient A’s incision, she was not present and did not know how
Patient A developed burns. Postoperatively, Patient A developed pneumonia and was placed on
antibiotics. Additionally, Patient A’s creatinine levels rose and all nephrotoxic agents were
discontinued.

4. On June 5, 2015, Respondent ordered a renal ultrasound due to Patient A’s elevated
serum creatinine levels, conducted Patient A’s abdominal exam, and at 7:13 p.m. that evening,
Respondent documented such within the hospital entry progress notes. Patient A’s preoperative
level of creatinine was 89 and, on this date, it reached a high of 1.72.

5. On June 6, 2015, Patient A was discharged following Respondent’s renal
ultrasound being performed that morning. Results of the aforementioned ultrasound indicated a
mild hydronephrosis, and the attending radiologist recommended a CT considered for further
evaluation. The medical records do not indicate whether Respondent knew of these results prior
to Patient A’s discharge.

6. On June 17, 2015, Respondent dictated her surgical report and commented the
following: “I perform complicated cancer procedures three days a week. In addition to that I
specialize in complicated benign gyn procedures (5/24/15).” Details of this report differ from
those recorded by the nursing staff, the treating anesthesiologist and physicians involved in
Patient A’s postoperative care; specifically, the Respondent’s report does not comment on the
repair of a small bowel injury nor does it indicate completing a bilateral hypogastric artery ligation
— all of which are well-documented in the hospital records. Additionally, Respondent stated that
she used monocryl sutures to close Patient A’s incision but her operative dictation done on
6/1/2015 states that staples were used to close the incision on Patient A.

7. On June 23, 2015, Respondent’s physician assistant examined Patient A, who
expressed no complaints. However, Patient A’s vital signs indicated HR of 118 and blood
pressure of 188/125. Assessment was that Patient A was suffering from gastrointestinal
symptoms, with elevated blood pressure and she was advised to go to the emergency room. There
was no discussion or medical record annotation of whether the ultrasound results (from the

6/5/2015 order) were reviewed or known by Respondent prior to Patient A’s discharge.

8. On July 3, 2015, Patient A was examined (vaginal cuff evaluation) by
Respondent’s physician assistant and it was determined that Patient A suffered from
gastrointestinal symptoms, with severely elevated blood pressure. Respondent instructed Patient
A to get to the emergency room. There was no discussion or medical record annotation of
whether the ultrasound results (from the 6/5/2015 order) were reviewed or known by Respondent
prior to Patient A’s discharge.

9, On July 6, 2015, Patient A was admitted with a complaint of shortness of breath
and was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism and started on a heparin treatment. A nephrostomy
tube was placed within Patient A due to a recent left ureteral obstruction and nephrosis. Patient
A’s previous renal ultrasound revealed hydronephrosis.

10. On July 28, 2015, Patient A was readmitted to the hospital for nephrostomy tube
placement. A cystoscopy, left retrograde pyelogram, and left antegrade nephrogram and
cystogram were performed. From these procedures, it was found that there was a complete
obstruction of Patient’s A distal ureter. On the antegrade nephrogram, there was complete
obstruction at the mid to mid-distal ureter with a significant gap between the two obstructed areas.
A wire could not be placed through the areas of obstruction.

11. Previous to the preparation of this Complaint, the Board solicited the services of an
independent medical expert (IME) to review Patient A’s medical records and the medical care
provided to such patient by Respondent. This IME opined that Respondent’s medical care of
Patient A violated the Medical Practice Act due to her acts and omissions when rendering care to
Patient A.
