COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Edward Michael Outlaw, M.D.

reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes

Practice Act, or MPA). The IC alleges the following facts:

iF Respondent is, and was at all times relevant to this case, a physician licensed to
practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10630). His license was originally issued
by the Board on September 8, 2003.

2. On or about May 22, 2010, Respondent signed a storage unit rental agreement for
storage space #C223 at Life Storage located at 9930 S. Spencer Street, Las Vegas, NV 89183
(Life Storage Unit).

3. Respondent failed to make payment to Life Storage since September 4, 2016,
thereafter placing him in default of his rental agreement.

4. A Lien Sale Notice was mailed to Respondent by the proprietor of Life Storage on

November 18, 2016.

5, On or about June 5, 2017, Board staff received information that medical records,

| The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), at the time this formal

including patient charts, demographics, medical histories, charts, films and other items, which
contained patient personal identifying information, for which Respondent, as a provider of health
care and as custodian of records, was responsible, may have been abandoned by Respondent
inside the Life Storage Unit.

6. On June 19, 2017, Board staff, along with staff from the Nevada State Board of
Pharmacy, conducted an on-site initial inspection of the Life Storage Unit. The initial inspection
discovered, among other items, the following:

Respondent;

b. Four unlocked filing cabinets, three of which were inaccessible at the time of
initial inspection due to location and placement inside the unit;

c. Miscellaneous office supplies;

d. One blank prescription.

hs On June 19, 2017, Board staff contacted Respondent by telephone and informed
him of the discovery of the abandoned medical records and of his responsibility to immediately
take possession of the medical records and/or properly destroy files that no longer needed to be
retained. Respondent informed Board staff that he was under the belief that his mother had taken
care of those records and that he would make arrangements to have his mother arrange for the
records to be destroyed, as he was no longer residing in Nevada.

8. On June 20, 2017, the Investigative Committee issued a First Order to Respondent
to produce records and respond to a formal Allegation Letter dated the same day regarding
possible violations of the MPA related to the medical records and other items abandoned at the
Life Storage Unit.

nor his mother had contacted Life Storage to arrange for the custody and/or destruction of the
medical records.
