COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Matthew Obim Okeke, M.D.
(Respondent), a physician licensed in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical
Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent was licensed (License No. 14957) in Nevada by the Board on
September 6, 2013, with a scope of practice in psychiatry.

‘TREATMENT OF PATIENT A

a Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Respondent provided medical services and care to Patient A from August 9, 2015,
through January 30, 2018.

4. On August 9, 2015, Patient A presented to Respondent for an initial psychiatric
evaluation, Based upon his initial evaluation, Respondent indicated the following diagnoses: Bipolar’
I Disorder, Most Recent Episode Depressed,” “Post-traumatic Stress Disorder,” and “Generalized

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal Complaint

Anxiety Disorder.” Respondent prescribed the following treatment medications: Geodon, Effexor’
XR, and Proprandolol.

5. On October 7, 2015, Respondent did not document any assessment or treatment plan
in Patient A’s medical record.

6. On October 19, 2015, Respondent documents a follow-up encounter with Patient A.
and the medical record documentation is verbatim compared to the October 7, 2015 medical record,
despite this encounter lasting for 30 minutes.

7 On December 8, 2015, Respondent noted a pertinent and original subjective report of|
Patient A; however, there was no assessment or clinical rationale for treatment, but for a configuration
of copied and pasted generic phrases substituted for a unique and pertinent medical record.
Respondent prescribed a benzodiazepine (Xanax 0.Smg PO BID), which was the activitating
antidepressant and a beta-blocker. Here, the primary diagnosis of Patient A, as indicated in the
medical records, was Bipolar I Disorder, and such a treatment plan of prescribing Xanax is not within
the standard of care.

8. On February 24, 2016, Respondent documented a relevant subjective section, but there
is no specific or original documentation in the Assessment or Plan sections; there is no clinical
reasoning or decision-making and, as previous medical records maintained by the Respondent, this
encounter with Patient A is documented with a vast majority of copy and paste phrases from previous
medical records. The Nevada Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) report of Patient A indicates a
controlled substance prescription for benzodiazepine medication alprazolam (Xanax) in the amount of
60 (quantity) 0.5 milligram tablets, as prescribed by the Respondent.

9. On March 21, 2016, Respondent’s medical record for this encounter of Patient A is
verbatim compared to the previous 2/24/2016 encounter, including an identical subjective section.
The PMP report of Patient A indicates a controlled substance prescription for benzodiazepine
medication alprazolam (Xanax) in the amount of 60 (quantity) 2.0 milligram tablets (four times the
previous prescription amount). Respondent failed to document the medical justification for this
‘substantial and significant increase in this controlled substance for Patient A’s treatment plan.

10. On April 18, 2016, Respondent's medical record for the encounter is verbatim when
compared to the two previous medical records (2/24/16 and 3/21/16), including the same subjective
section. Here, Respondent changed the Xanax prescription dosage from 0.5 mg PO BID (as
documented on 2/24/2016) to a 2.0 mg PO BID. Respondent failed to document any clinical rationale
given for such an increase in dosage and there was no formulation or specific treatment plan
documented. Patient A’s dosage of Xanax increased by four (4) times from 0.5 mg to 2.0 mg.

11. On May 17, 2016, Respondent’s medical record is verbatim when compred to the
medical records from 2/24/2016, 3/21/2016, and 4/18/2016. There is no new or specific original
documentation pertaining to this specific encounter between Patient A and Respondent.

12, On June 14, 2016, Respondent's medical record of this follow-up encounter contains
specific and pertinent information in the subjective section; the remainder of this encounter was copied
and pasted from prior encounters.

13, From July 7, 2016 through January 30, 2018, all of the documented encounters
between Respondent and Patient A are essentially verbatim when compared to the June 14, 2016
medical record, and contain no original documentation to theses specific patient encounter dates, but
for the exception of the start/stop times and Patient A’s blood pressure. Specifically, the dates for
these verbatim medical records are as follows: 7/12/2016, 8/9/2016, 9/7/2016, 10/5/2016, 11/2/2016,
112872016, 12/28/2016, 1/25/2017, 2/23/2017, 3/22/2017, 4/19/2017, 5/17/2017, 7/12/2017,
8/9/2017, 9/7/2017, 10/5/2017, 11/2/2017, 11/30/2017, 12/28/2017 [this note indicates that Xanax (2
mg PO BID) was the only medication prescribed], and the last encounter between Patient A and
Respondent was on 1/30/2018 [this note indicates that the following were prescribed: Xanax (0.5 mg),
Effexor XR, Proprandolol].

14. On December 28, 2017, Patient A, without Respondent's consent, video recorded her
patient encounter with the Respondent by placing her smart phone video camera upon Respondent's
desk. This video shows the physical proximity between Respondent and Patient A, who can be clearly
seen rubbing Respondent's arm, then later rubbing his back, and, eventually attempting to touch
Respondent's groin area. At no time during this interaction did the Respondent re-direct Patient A
away from his personal and physical space. There was no therapeutic interpretation or confrontation

by the Respondent regarding Patient A’s comments or behavior? during this patient encounter.
AGREI WITH PATIENT A
15. On May 5, 2018, Patient A and Respondent entered into an agreement (Agreement).
This Agreement appears to be a legal document, drafted by a Nevada licensed attomey, signed by
Patient A and Respondent, and involves having Patient A refrain from filing, or assisting any other,
individual from filing, lawsuits, administrative actions or complaints against the Respondent in return
for Patient A receiving monetary payments of $25,000 (paid in 2/2018), $3,000 (in April of 2018), and
$1500 (paid on 5/8/2018).
TREATMENT OF PATIENT B
16. Patient B’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.
17. Respondent provided medical services and care to Patient B, who was a 10-year-old
male, from 9/9/2015 to 1/30/2018.
18. On September 9, 2015, Respondent provided an initial evaluation during the timeframe

from 9:25 am to 10:30 am, which is essentially the same time period of Respondent's encounter with
“Autistic Disorder,” and

Patient A. Respondent noted the following diagnoses: “ADHD,
“Intermittent Explosive Disorder,” and then prescribed Nuedexta and Clonidine in furtherance of]
Patient B’s treatment plan.

19. On or about April of 2019, the IC reviewed the findings from an Independent
Medical Expert (IME), who reviewed the medical records and additional relevant documentation,
and, consequently, this IME opined that Respondent, via his acts and/or omissions, violated the
Medical Practice Act when rendering medical care and treatment to Patient A and Patient B.

reviewed the medical records and additional relevant documentation, including, but not limited to, Patient A’s video
tape, Respondent's written responses to the IC and other relevant information.
