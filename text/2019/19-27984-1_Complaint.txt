BEFORE THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS

OF THE STATE OF NEVADA
In the Matter of Charges and Case No. 19-27984-1
Complaint Against
FILED
ALLISON KAY DAVIS, M.D.,
Respondent. APR - 2 2019

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Allison Kay Davis, M.D. (Respondent), a
physician formerly licensed in Nevada, as her license is currently expired. After investigating this
matter, the IC has a reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada
Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

l. Respondent was licensed (License No. 14855) in Nevada by the Board on July 1,
2013. Respondent’s license expired on or about June 30, 2017, but at all times relevant to this
Complaint, she was a physician licensed to practice medicine in Nevada subject to the jurisdiction of
the Board as set forth in the Medical Practice Act.

2. Patient A was a 60-year-old male at the time of the events alleged in this
Complaint. His true identity is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect his identity, but his
identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with this
Complaint.

3. On or about December 30, 2015, Patient A presented to the emergency room at
Centennial Hills Hospital (CHH) and was diagnosed with acute cholecystitis.

4. Respondent met with Patient A on or about the next day, December 31, 2015, and

' The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D., Ms. Sandy
Peltyn and Beverly Neyland, M.D.

spoke with Patient A and members of his family for a surgical consultation.

5 Respondent put Patient A on a clinical course of “conservative management with
IVF, IV and PO pain medication, and antibiotics.”

6. Respondent did not schedule Patient A for immediate surgery after adequate
resuscitation. Instead, Respondent decided that Patient A may respond to “conservative
management” and if Patient A responded, he could be discharged, and then could follow up for
elective cholecystectomy.

Te The clinical course of “conservative management” failed to provide remedies for
Patient A, and Patient A suffered from continual abdominal pain and could not eat.

8. Respondent did not return to evaluate Patient A again until January 4, 2016, just
prior to his eventual surgery that day.

9. Respondent did not document an exam or conversation with Patient A prior to his
surgery on January 4, 2016. Additionally, Respondent failed to document a conversation
involving informed consent with Patient A about the surgery.

Count I

reference as though fully set forth herein.

Lh NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice by a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

12. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

13. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
she treated Patient A with “conservative management” rather than proceeding with surgery after
adequate resuscitation.

14. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as in

NRS 630.352.
