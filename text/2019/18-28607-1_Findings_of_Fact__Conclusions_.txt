incurred by the Board as part of its investigative, administrative and disciplinary proceedings
against Respondent, and finds them to be reasonable based on: (1) the abilities, training,
education, experience, professional standing and skill demonstrated by Board staff and attorneys;
(2) the character of the work done, its difficulty, its intricacy, its importance, the time and skill
required, the responsibility imposed and the prominence and character of the parties where, as in
this case, they affected the importance of the litigation; (3) the work actually performed by the
Board’s attorneys and staff, and the skill, time and attention given to that work; and (4) the
product of the work and benefits to the Board and the people of Nevada that were derived
therefrom.
