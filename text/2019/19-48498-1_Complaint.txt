active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 17977). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on June 6, 2018.

Medical Board, which issued a Letter of Admonition. This formal action was based upon his role
as a “medical director” at several laser and skin care clinics and his failure to adequately supervise
unlicensed individuals who treated patients at the aforementioned clinics. Respondent did not
inform this Board of the aforementioned discipline within 30 days as required.

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal Complaint
was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chairman, Mr. M. Neil
