COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this Complaint (Complaint) against Terrance J. Kwiatkowski, M.D. (Respondent), a
licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC’ has a reasonable basis to
believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and
the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act). The
IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent was licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical
Practice Act, on August 27, 2001, and is currently licensed in active status (License No. 9962).

2. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On July 1, 2014, Patient A presented to the Desert Springs Hospital Emergency
Room (ER) with a complaint of right facial swelling and a diagnosis of parotitis, and was
subsequently discharged with oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin) and pain medications.

| At the time filing of the Complaint was approved, the IC was composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Michael J. Fischer, M.D., and Ms. Valerie J. Clark.

4. On July 2, 2014, Patient A returned to Desert Springs Hospital ER with a
complaint of worsening symptoms, and was transferred to Sunrise Hospital for an Ear, Nose and
Throat (ENT) specialist consult. Patient A was started on IV antibiotics (Clindamycin) and a CT
scan indicated a parotid edema on the right side and 3 mm stone in the parotid duct on the same
side.

5. On July 5, 2014, Patient A presented to Respondent, who recommended
intravenous steroids and antibiotics overnight, and he also recommended Patient A be discharged
with oral antibiotics for 10 days and a steroid taper.

6. On July 6, 2014, Patient A was discharged, based on Respondent’s treatment plan,
with oral Clindamycin and pain medications. Steroids were prescribed by Respondent on July 7,
2014.

7. On July 8, 2014, Patient A presented to St. Rose Siena Hospital, with no
improvement in symptoms and with difficulty opening his mouth, and was admitted with ENT and
Infectious Disease was consulted. Patient A was started on intravenous antibiotics (Vancomycin
& Zosyn), pursuant to the Infectious Disease doctor.

8. On July 9, 2014, Patient A was seen by Respondent, who recommended that the
current treatment of IV antibiotics be continued, but did not recommend sialogogues (drugs that
increase saliva production), which Respondent believed would have worsened Patient A’s
parutitis condition. Respondent recommended to staff that he be informed if Patient A’s condition
got worse.

9. On July 14, 2014, Patient A had another CT scan due to no improvement and
worsening symptoms. This CT scan indicated “wall thickening, rim enhancing collection
occupying the parotid, spacing measuring 3 x 2.3 cm as well as calcifications within the parotid
gland consistent with an abscess,” pursuant to the Radiology report. Respondent saw Patient A
and reviewed the scan with a Radiologist. Respondent’s recommendation was to continue IV
antibiotics, and determined that Patient A’s condition was not an abscess.

10. On July 18, 2014, another CT scan was conducted because of Patient A’s condition
and worsening symptoms. This CT scan read “increased in right parotid hypodensity,” measuring
3.6 x 4.6 cm compared to the July 9, 2014 CT scan, which measured 2 x 2.7 cm. Diagnosis was
an abscess with a compression of the jugular vein or thrombosis and some airway compromise.

11. On July 19, 2014, Respondent was contacted by staff at 4:00 am, with information
that Patient A was experiencing increased difficulty breathing and the results of the CT scan
(7/18/14). Respondent did not see Patient A at this time. Four hours later, at 8:00 am,
Respondent called the staff nurse and instructed her to place Patient A on NPO (no food or
liquids), with plans to later take Patient A to the operating room to drain the previously non-
diagnosed abscess. At 8:10 am, the nurse informed Respondent that Patient A was experiencing
respiratory distress. Respondent recommended the nurse call the code team. Patient A coded for
approximately 90 minutes, several unsuccessful attempts were made to secure a clear airway, and
an emergent airway was placed. Patient A’s condition was discussed with family, and it was
decided that life support was withdrawn on July 20, 2014.

12. Patient A’s death was found to be the parotid abscess, which caused airway
obstruction resulting in an anoxic encephalopathy.

13. Previous to the preparation of this Complaint, the Board solicited the services of an
independent medical expert (IME) to review Patient A’s medical records and the care provided to
such patient by Respondent. This IME opined that Respondent’s care of Patient A violated the
Medical Practice Act due to his acts and omissions when rendering care to Patient A.
