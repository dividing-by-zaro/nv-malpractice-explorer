possession and control of the medication until after he or she
creates a patient-specific and medication-specific order for
the administration of the medication,

3. To the extent a controlled substance or dangerous drug
called for in an order is put into the possession and control of
anyone other than a practitioner, the ordering practitioner
personally gives possession and control of the controlled
substance or dangerous drug to the non-practitioner and only
gives the non-practitioner the specific medication in the
specific quantity needed to fill the order,

4, Respondent and his offices/clinics will purchase medications
only from a Nevada-licensed and federally registered
outsourcing facility, and

record of a licensing agency showing a conviction or plea of nolo contendere or the suspension,
revocation, limitation, modification, denial or surrender of a license to practice medicine is
conclusive evidence of its occurrence.
