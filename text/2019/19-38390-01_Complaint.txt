Against FI LE D
ASHER SHAHZAD, M.D., JUL 12 2019

NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

Respondent. MEDICAL EXAMINERS

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC)! of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Jasmine K. Mehta, Esq., Deputy Executive Director and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Asher Shahzad, M.D. (Respondent), violated the provisions
of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a licensed medical doctor
holding an active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 13790).
Respondent was originally licensed by the Board on January 5, 2011.

2. Patient A was a 25-year-old female at the time of the incidents in question. Her
name is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with a copy of this Complaint.

3. At the time of the events in question, Patient A had given birth to premature twins
on or about May 11, 2013.

1The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal Complaint
was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chairman, Theodore B. Berndt,

M.D., and Mr. M. Neil Duxbury.

4. Following discharge from the hospital, on or about May 18, 2013, Patient A
presented to the emergency department with a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Patient A was
discharged by a doctor other than Respondent with instructions to monitor her condition.

5. On May 23, 2013, Patient A presented with fever, was seen by a doctor other than
Respondent, and was referred to another doctor for evaluation of possible mastitis. The physician
to whom she was referred evaluated her for mastitis on or about May 29, 2013, and referred her to
Dr. Dhaval Shah for an infectious disease evaluation.

6. Upon information and belief, Dr. Shah, at the times relevant to this Complaint, was
Respondent’s practice partner or colleague at Clinical Infectious Disease Specialists. From May
31, 2013 through June 12, 2013, Dr. Shah treated Patient A with various antibiotics, including
intravenous antibiotic treatment, for an abdominal wound infection and recurring fever after the
infection had resolved.

7. On June 20, 2013, Patient A was admitted to the hospital with complaints of fever,
weakness, dizziness and confusion. She was seen by Respondent. Respondent determined Patient
A had a fever of unknown origin, but did not consider tuberculosis as part of the differential
diagnosis. Upon information and belief, Respondent allegedly discussed with Patient A and her
husband whether she had been screened for tuberculosis; however, Respondent’s medical records
do not reflect any such conversation.

8. From June 20, 2013 through June 28, 2013, Patient A was seen nearly daily by
Respondent. During that time, several imaging studies and laboratory results should have
prompted consideration of tuberculosis. Patient A’s chest computed tomography (CT) scans from
June 21, 2013 and June 30, 2013 showed fine reticular interstitial opacities, that, while not
diagnostic of tuberculosis, are consistent with miliary tuberculosis, a potential cause of fevers of
unknown origin. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of Patient A’s head and spine on June 23,
2013 and June 24, 2013 showed changes consistent with meningitis, and the leptomeninges
enhancement on the June 24, 2013 MRI is more common with tuberculosis than with
toxoplasmosis, the latter of which Respondent did consider. However, Respondent did not

consider tuberculosis in his differential diagnosis.

9. On June 30, 2013, Patient A was transferred to UCLA Medical Center.

10. On July 1, 2013, Patient A expired. An autopsy confirmed that Patient A had
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.

18. In the event that Respondent claims that he discussed tuberculosis risk factors with
Patient A and/or her husband on or about June 20, 2013, and whether she had previously been

provided in NRS 630.352.
