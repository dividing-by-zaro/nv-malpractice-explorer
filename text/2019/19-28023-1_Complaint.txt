COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Edward Michael Outlaw, M.D.
(Respondent), a physician licensed in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical
Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is, and was at all times relevant to this case, a physician licensed to
practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10630). His license was originally issued
by the Board on September 8, 2003.

2. On or about May 19, 2015, a warrant for the arrest of Respondent was issued by
the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada, in Case No. A-13-683202-F (Civil
Case). The Civil Case is a lawsuit to collect on a judgment of $80,504.49, plus interest and fees,
owed by Respondent to Bankers Healthcare Group, Inc. The court in the Civil Case determined
that Respondent had “violated various Orders of this Court, including his failure to abide by the
Court’s Amended Order to Show Cause filed April 9, 2015 and has otherwise been found to be in
contempt,” and the court therefore ordered Respondent to be arrested by any available sheriff,

marshall, or other peace officer in Nevada. As of the time of this Complaint, the warrant for the

| The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chairman, Theodore
B. Berndt, M.D., and Mr. M. Neil Duxbury.

arrest of Respondent is still outstanding, and the judgment remains unsatisfied.

3. On July 17, 2015, Respondent filed a Notification of Address Change with the
Board, pursuant to NRS 630.254, instructing the Board to address all communications from the
Board to the licensee at 601 S. Rancho Road, Suite A3, Las Vegas, NV 89106.

4, On or about October 31, 2016, Respondent’s Controlled Substance License with
the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy expired.

Si On March 15, 2017, pursuant to NRS 630.311(1), the Investigative Committee (IC)
of the Board ordered Respondent to appear before it to give testimony regarding an ongoing
investigation on Friday, May 19, 2017 (IC Order to Appear). The IC Order to Appear was sent
via certified mail to 601 S. Rancho Rd., Suite A3, Las Vegas, NV 89106, as previously instructed
by Respondent.

6. On March 30, 2017, the IC Order to Appear was returned to the IC marked “Return
to Sender, Not Deliverable as Addressed Unable to Forward.”

a Respondent did not appear at the May 19, 2017 meeting of the IC as ordered.

8. On June 7, 2017, Respondent filed with the Board a Renewal Application, wherein
he applied to renew his license in “Inactive” status, paid the applicable fee, and informed the
Board that his new address was 10926 Merritt Drive, Stockton, CA 95219.

9. On or about November 15, 2017, the California Medical Board issued a license to
Respondent, which license is currently active.
