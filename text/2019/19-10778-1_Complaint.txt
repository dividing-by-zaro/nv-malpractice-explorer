COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Aaron Bart Fricke, Esq., Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Digby Maxwell Preston, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1, Respondent was at all times relevant to this Complaint, a physician licensed to
practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 7415). His license was originally issued by
the Board on May 11, 1995. Respondent’s license expired on June 30, 2015. Pursuant to NRS
630.298, the expiration of a license does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction to proceed with
disciplinary action.

2. Patient A was a 61-year-old male when he presented to Respondent for medical
care on August 21, 2014. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy,
but is disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this

Complaint.

! The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Chairman, Aury Nagy,
M.D., and Michael C. Edwards, M.D.

4. Respondent diagnosed the herniated disc and foraminal stenosis at L3/4 as the
source of Patient A’s pain. Respondent scheduled Patient A for a laminotomy decompression and
discectomy at L3/4 on September 16, 2014.

5. On September 16, 2014, and September 17, 2014, Respondent performed surgery
on Patient A, but did so at the wrong level of the spine, and Patient A suffered complications.
