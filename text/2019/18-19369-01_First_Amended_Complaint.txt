FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this First Amended Complaint (Complaint) against Christopher Seung Choi, M.D.
(Respondent), a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC! has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively the
Medical Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent was licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical
Practice Act, on September 15, 2000, and at all times relevant to this First Amended Complaint,
and is currently licensed in active status (License No. 9589).

2. Patient A was a 90-year-old female at the time of the incidents in question. Her
name is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with a copy of this First Amended
Complaint.

cM At the time of the events in question, Patient A was a resident of a nursing home in
Las Vegas, Nevada, and suffered from dementia, among other conditions. Respondent treated

certain patients there, including Patient A.

"The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time of filing of this First
‘Amended Complaint was approved, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Nei! Duxbury, Chairman, Aury Nagy,
M.D., and Michael C, Edwards, M.D., FACS.

4. On October 7, 2014, at a location outside of the nursing home, Patient A
underwent a procedure for installation of a pacemaker, with no apparent complications at that
time.

5. On October 20, 2014, Patient A complained of pain in her left hip and staff}
reported a popping noise from the hip area upon movement of left leg, Respondent ordered an x-
ray, which showed no fracture or acute dislocation.

6. On October 21, 2014, nursing staff noted that Patient A’s left foot was cool to the
touch and exhibited skin color changes.

7. On October 21, 2014, a venous duplex ultrasound was performed. It revealed no
evidence of a deep vein thrombosis. However, on the same date, an arterial duplex ultrasound
revealed “no flow present” in Patient A’s left proximal superficial femoral artery, left popliteal
artery, left anterior and posterior tibial artery, and left dorsalis pedis artery. The report stated that
there was “severe mild atherosclerotic plaquing in the left lower extremity with no detectable flow
beyond the distal thigh.” Further evaluation with a computed tomography (CT) angiogram was
recommended. The results were faxed to Respondent on October 21, 2014.

8. Later that day, Respondent saw Patient A. Respondent did not physically examine
Patient A’s lower left leg and foot that day. Respondent did not refer Patient A to a vascular
surgeon for consultation in spite of nursing notes that Patient A’s left leg was cool to the touch
and exhibited skin color changes and in spite of Patient A continuing to experience pain in her
left leg.

9. On October 29, 2014, Patient A was taken by ambulance to the emergency
department.

10. On October 29, 2014, Patient A underwent an ultrasound of her lower left leg and
an emergency angiograph, which showed total occlusion of the left limb aortic stent graft, left
common iliac, external iliac and common femoral arteries. The attending surgeon’s intial
assessment was that the leg would have to be amputated either above or below the knee.

11. On October 30, 2014, Patient A was taken to surgery for a bilateral, common
femoral endarterectomy, left profunda femoral endarterectomy, and a right femoral to left femoral
Gore-Tex graft, which surgery was successful and ultimately saved Patient A’s leg from
amputation.

(Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation)

12. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by.

14. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.

15. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with a vascular surgeon in light of
Patient A’s cool foot, skin color changes, and arterial duplex ultrasound findings that showed no
detectable flow beyond the distal thigh.

16. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
