COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(“Board”) hereby issues this formal Complaint against Cynthia V. Ivey, CRT (hereinafter referred
to as Respondent), a licensed Certified Respiratory Therapist (CRT) in Nevada. After
investigating this matter, the IC has a reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. RC1108).
Respondent was issued her license from the Board on April 18, 2005, pursuant to the provisions of
NRS Chapter 630.

2. Patient A was a 61-year-old female at the time of the events at issue. Her true
identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation
served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On or about November 15, 2014, Patient A, who was in critical condition and

recently intubated, was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) of Desert Springs

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D., Ms. Sandy Peltyn and Victor M. Muro,

Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada. Patient A was then transported from the MICU to receive a CT
scan and back to the MICU on the same day.

4. Respondent was the CRT assigned to accompany the patient and provide her
respiratory expertise and necessary respiratory equipment to ensure safe transport.

5. Another medical provider was also assigned to accompany Patient A and provide
medical expertise, monitoring equipment and medications that may have been necessary to ensure

a safe transport.

6. Upon information and belief, during transport of Patient A back from the CT scan,
the supplemental oxygen supply apparently ran out and a manual resuscitation bag was not
available to continue necessary ventilation.

7. Following these events, Respondent failed to document this information in Patient
A’s medical records as required by NRS 630.3062(1)(a) at the end of her shift on or about
November 15, 2014.

8. Upon information and belief, two days later, on or about November 17, 2014, at the
request and direction of Respondent, Michelle Clouthier, RRT made an entry into Patient A’s
medical records, using Respondent’s electronic signature (logon ID and password), which

Respondent provided to Ms. Clouthier.

9. Upon information and belief, Respondent made that request to Ms. Clouthier via
text message to Ms. Clouthier that stated, “Pt. in MICU 10 add note for yesterday 5:30 pm that
Patient desaturated on the way back from CT bagged Patient till oxygen came back up then put
patient back on vent.”

10. Ms. Clouthier did not provide or observe the patient care of Patient A, provided by
Respondent, on or about November 15, 2014.
