of the custodian for 5 years after their production.

5. Respondent did not maintain custody of his patients’ medical records at the Civic
Ctr. location as was his duty to perform pursuant to NRS 629.051 because Respondent was unable
to possess such due to his failure to remove those patient records prior to the foreclosure and/or

transfer of ownership of the Civic Ctr. office.

6. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
Count I

standing practicing in the same specialty or field constitutes grounds for initiating disciplinary
action.

the custodian of his patients’ medical records at the Civic Ctr. location for more than five years.
