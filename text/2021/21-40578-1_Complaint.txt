J. David Wuest, in his official capacity as Executive Secretary of the Nevada State Board
of Pharmacy, makes the following that will serve as both a notice of intended action under
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 233B.127(3), and as an accusation under NRS 622A.300(1).
NRS 639.241 and NAC 639.7445.

1.

The Nevada State Board of Pharmacy (“Board”) has jurisdiction over this matter and

each of these Respondents because at the time of the events alleged herein. Respondents. and

each of them, held a registration issued by the Board:
1. Ravi Ramanathan, M.D. (“Ramanathan”), held a Controlled Substance
Registration, Certificate No. CS14526. and a Practitioner Dispensing Registration, Certificate
No. PD00143;

2. Beraldo Vazquez-Correa, M.D. (“Vazquez-Correa”), held a Controlled Substance
Registration, Certificate of Registration Nos. CS04757. He obtained a Dispensing Practitioner
Registration, Certificate of Registration No. PD00559, on September 29, 2015, while this case
was under investigation.

3. Joshua Smith, P.A. (“Smith”), held a Controlled Substance Registration,

Certificate of Registration No. CS2066]. Ramanathan was Smith’s supervising physician;

4, Yaakov Dovid Kotlarsky, P.A. (*Koltlarsky”), held a Controlled Substance

physician;

5. Jennifer Lauren Relph. P.A. (“Relph’), held a Controfled Substance Registration.
Certificate of Registration No. CS20905. Ramanathan was Relph’s supervising physician;

Additionally, non-respondents Jasmine Martinez, D.1. (‘Martinez’). held a Dispensing
Technician Registration, Certificate of Registration No. TD01349; and Daisy Ibarra, D.T.
(“Ibarra”), held a Dispensing Technician Registration, Certificate of Registration No. TD01192.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Il.

In July and August 2015, Ramanathan owned and/or operated a medical clinic called
Family Doctors of Green Valley (the “Clinic”) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Ramanathan held a
Controlled Substance Registration and a Dispensing Practitioner Registration at that time.

Ul.

Dr. Vazquez-Correa and physician's assistants Smith. Kotlarsky and Relph were licensed
practitioners who worked at the Clinic. Each of them held a Controlled Substance Registration.
but none of them held a Nevada Dispensing Practitioner Registration at that time. Vazquez-
Correa obtained a Nevada Dispensing Practitioner Registration on September 29, 2015.

IV.
Martinez and Ibarra were dispensing technicians who worked with Ramanathan and the
other respondent practitioners at the Clinic.

inlawful Dispen:

Vv.

Ramanathan did not require Vazquez-Correa, Smith. Kotlarsky, or Relph to obtain a

Dispensing Practitioner Registration while they worked at the Clinic.
Vi.

Ramanathan instructed and allowed Vazquez-Correa, Smith, Kotlarsky. and Relph to
each write prescriptions using their-own name, and then fill their patients* prescriptions using
Ramanathan’s Dispensing Practitioner Registration and using prescription drugs from
Ramanathan’s prescription drug inventory.

Vil.

Vazquez-Correa. Smith. Kotlarsky, and Relph followed that pattern, including between
July 24, 2015, and August 10, 2015, when Ramanathan was not present at the Clinic, including
at times when he was out of the Country.

Vil.

Between July 24, 2015, and August 10, 2015. Vazquez-Correa. Smith, Kotlarsky. and
Relph wrote a total of 213 prescriptions for controlled substances. They dispensed prescription
drugs to fill those 213 prescriptions from Ramanathan’s inventory in Ramanathan’s absence.

IX.

Vazquez-Correa, Smith, Kotlarsky, and Relph reported to the Nevada Prescription

Monitoring Program (“PMP”) that Ramanathan wrote each of those 213 prescriptions, and that

Ramanathan dispensed the medication.
X.

Specific instances in July and August 2015, in which Vazquez-Correa, Smith, Kotlarsky,
and Relph followed the pattern described above to dispense controlled substances to their
patients from Ramanathan’s inventory include:

Smith, PA-C — Smith saw patient M.J. on July 24, 2015, and August 18. 2015.
After each examination, Smith wrote a prescription for M.J. for a schedule II-controlled
substance. Smith filled each of those prescriptions from Ramanathan’s prescription drug
inventory and reported to the PMP that Ramanathan both prescribed the medication and

dispensed it. Ramanathan was not on site.

Relph, PA-C — Relph saw patient M.D. on July 29, 2015. and wrote a
prescription for a schedule 1V-controlled substance. Relph dispensed the medication to M.D.
from Ramanathan’s prescription drug inventory. She reported to the PMP that Ramanathan
prescribed the medication and dispensed it. Ramanathan was not on site.

Kotlarsky, PA-C ~ Kotlarsky saw patient S.A.H. on August 5, 2015, and wrote a
prescription for a schedule [V-controlled substance. Kotlarsky dispensed the medication to
S.A.H. from Ramanathan’s prescription drug inventory. He reported to the PMP that
Ramanathan prescribed the medication and dispensed it. Ramanathan was not in the office when
Kotlarsky filled that prescription.

Vazquez-Correa, M.D. - Ramanathan’s unlawful dispensing practices were not
confined to the July 24, through August 10, 2015. time period. On July 17. 2015, Vazquez-
Correa wrote a prescription for a schedule IV-controlled substance for Ramanathan for personal
use. Vazquez-Correa and/or Ramanathan dispensed that medication to Ramanathan and reported
to the PMP that Ramanathan prescribed and dispensed the medication.

Inadequate Inventory Controls
XI.
Ramanathan failed to keep a record of his opening inventory of controlled substances.
He could not produce that record when requested during an August 2014 inspection.

XI.

During the August 2014 inspection, the Board Inspector directed Ramanathan to
complete an inventory of the controlled substances in his possession. Ramanathan purportedly
complied. as evidenced by an inventory report he later provided to the Board inspector dated
August 26, 2014. Ramanathan could not produce that inventory report the following year when
asked by a Board Inspector during a September 2015 annual inspection.’

XI.
During an audit of Ramanathan’s controlled substance inventory by the Drug

Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) in 2015, DEA found a variance of 83,241 tablets/capsules

(approximately 3,228 bottles) between the inventory that Ramanathan purchased, and the

inventory that he could account for at the time of the audit. A summary of the variance is as

follows:
Tablets/Capsules Bottles
Shortage 76,821 3.085
Overage _ 6.420 143
Total Variance 83.241 3.228
XIV.

Asa result of those variances. on or about March 3, 2016, Ramanathan entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding with the United States of America, represented by the United
States Auorney’s Office for the District of Nevada and DEA, in which he agreed to resolve
allegations that he violated Federal law (the Controlled Substance Act. 21 U.S.C. § 842(a)(5))
“from about August 8, 2014, through on or about December 5, 2015. by failing to properly

maintain required records regarding certain controlled substances.”

‘ Board Staff provided Ramanathan a copy of his own August 26. 2014 Inventory Report from the
Board’s files on or about October 26, 2015. after Ramanathan failed to produce it from his records.

XIV.

To resolve those charges, Ramanathan agreed to “pay civil penalties in the amount of
$75,000.00 to the United States” and “not to dispense, or have any employce or independent
contractor dispense, any controlled substance at any future time.”

XV.

Ramanathan failed to record the quantities of schedule H-controlled substances that he
received on some of his DEA Form-222., as he was required to do. He also failed to sign at least
one DEA Form-222.

XVI.

Ramanathan gave unlawful access to his prescription drug inventory to his non-
practitioner staff members, Instances of that access include:

1. Ramanathan gave a key and access (o his drug storage room when he was
not on site at the Clinic to Martinez, a Dispensing Technician, who is not a licensed practitioner
or registered nurse and who does not otherwise have authority to have independent access to or
possession of dangerous drugs or controlled substances.

2. Ramanathan gave a key to the front door of the Clinic. the building alarm
code. and access to a tock box that contained a key to the Clinic drug room to employce Sheila
Gool. who was not a licensed practitioner or registered nurse, and who did not otherwise have
authority to have access to or possession of dangerous drugs or controlled substances.

3. Ramanathan gave Martinez the code to the Clinic’s safe where he stored a
portion of his schedule II-controlled substance inventory, which included Norco and Xanav.
Martinez and/or Gool had access to those medications when Ramanathan was not on site.

4. Ramanathan’s staff, including Martinez and Ibarra. kept quantities of
controlled substances in their desks and in other unsecure locations at the Clinic as a

convenience, which they could access when Ramanathan was not on site.
5. Ramanathan did not take an inventory to validate the accuracy of his
remaining inventory after he became aware that his staff kept supplies of medications outside of
the Clinic’s locked storage area.

XVII.

During an August 8, 2014 annual inspection a Board inspector cautioned Ramanathan
about allowing his staff access to his inventory of medications when he was not on site at the
Clinic. Ramanathan acknowledged with his signature the inspector's written statement that:
“Discussed and practitioner [Ramanathan] understands access to medications is only available
when he is physically present at the facility.”

XMIL.

During an annual inspection on September 1. 2015, a Board inspector again noted in the
inspection report that “Dispensing tech Jasmine Martinez has access to all controlled substances
and dangerous drugs” and “Dr. Ramanathan informed in 2014 inspection that access to
dispensing meds [sic] can only occur when he is physically present in the facility. Dr.
Ramanathan has continued to allow staff access to narcotics and dangerous drugs while he was
not on site and/or out of the country.”

XIX.

amanathan failed to store the schedule [l-controlled substance prescriptions he
dispensed separately from the prescriptions for schedule III, IV and V controlled substances and
dangerous drugs he dispensed.

XX.

On November 13, 2017, while the Board’s investigation was on-going. Ramanathan
surrendered his Dispensing Practitioner Registration. Certificate of Registration No. PD00143.
Dispensing Technicians (Respondent) Jasmin Martinez and Dan M. Beatty. Certificates of
Registration Nos. TD01349 and TD01390. respectively, surrendered their registrations at the

same time.
