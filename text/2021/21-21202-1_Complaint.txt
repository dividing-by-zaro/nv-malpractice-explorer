In the Matter of Charges and Complaint | Case No. 21-21202-1

FILED

ARTURO MARCHAND, JR., M.D., FEB ~ 8 2021
NEVADA STATE B 4
Respondent. MEDICAL EXAMINERS

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(“Board”) hereby issues this formal Complaint against Arturo Marchand, Jr., M.D. (hereinafter
referred to as Respondent), a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC
has a reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised
Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively,
the Medical Practice Act).

The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is currently, and was at all times relevant to this Complaint, licensed in
active status (License No. 9892). Respondent was issued his license from the Board on
July 17, 2001, pursuant to the provisions of NRS Chapter 630.

Patient A

2. Patient A was a sixty-one (61) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.
Her true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On April 14, 2016, Patient A first presented to Respondent for an outpatient clinic

visit at Nevada Heart and Vascular Center (NHVC). Laboratory results on December 29, 2015,

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, and Aury Nagy, M.D.

revealed an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3, which is below normal range for persons
with prosthetic heart valves. This demonstrated possible subtherapeutic anticoagulation with her
prescribed Warfarin (Coumadin). However Respondent did not report in medical records any
details with regards to whether Patient A was noncompliant taking her prescribed Warfarin.

4, On June 2, 2016, Patient A presented again to Respondent for a follow-up visit at
NHVC. Respondent did not report in the medical records any details whether Patient A was
noncompliant taking her prescribed Warfarin. Laboratory results thereafter on June 17, 2016,
revealed an INR of 1.4. This demonstrated possible subtherapeutic anticoagulation with her
prescribed Warfarin.

5. On October 6, 2016, Patient A presented again to Respondent at NHVC.
Respondent made the determination that Patient A was not in compliance with taking her
Warfarin therapy and INR.

6. On October 6, 2016, Respondent changed Patient A’s prescription from Warfarin
to Pradaxa, despite knowing that Patient A had a mechanical mitral valve prosthesis. The medical
records indicate that Respondent discussed with Patient A that she needed to be compliant with
her anticoagulation, and that Patient A had significant risk factors. But the medical records do not
provide any indication that Respondent discussed the risks nor had Patient A sign an informed
consent for switching to Pradaxa, or that there was a discussion about the contraindications
associated with the use of Pradaxa by a patient with a mechanical mitral valve prosthesis.’

7. On October 28, 2016, Patient A presented to the Emergency Department at Desert
Springs Hospital complaining of severe retrosternal chest pain. During her stay at Desert Springs
Hospital, Patient A was successfully treated with an aspiration thrombectomy.

8. On October 29, 2016, Patient A was restarted on Warfarin while still at the hospital
and was discharged from the hospital on November 3, 2016.


2 Use of Pradaxa is contraindicative in patients with mechanical mitral valve prostheses and the FDA has
issued a black box warning.
