Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
MEDICAD EXAM NERS

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Robert G. Kilroy, Esq., Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the
IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Luke Saint John Cesaretti, M.D., (Respondent) violated
the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the
IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. At all times relative to this Complaint, Respondent held an active license to practice
medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 6238), originally licensed by the Board on
June 8, 1991.

2. On February 22, 2017, Patient A’s initial abdominal ultrasound indicated a clear
two (2) cm mass in the mid-body of her pancreas.

3. On March 10, 2017, Patient A was seen by Respondent for an MRI due to the
suspicious mass on her pancreas. It was noted in the Respondent’s records that Patient A had a
history of an abnormal pancreas on a recent CT scan. Respondent did not attempt to or obtain

Patient A’s prior examinations, nor did he review patient’s images from the February 22, 2017,

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members, Chairman Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D,

ultrasound prior to his interpretation his MRI for Patient A. Notwithstanding this, the Respondent
noted that there was “no pancreatic masses are discernable” from his interpretation of Patient A’s
MRI. Respondent noted the dilated pancreatic duct and atrophy of the pancreas at the level of
ductal dilatation. Further he noted that the ductal dilation could be either developmental or
possibly to a stricture of the duct proximal to the dilated portion. Respondent did not specify in
Patient A’s medical records, the importance of the findings and the relationship these findings
have to the diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Specifically, the dilated pancreatic
duct indicates a high risk for an underlying pancreatic cancer. The association with the pancreatic
atrophy is another indicator of Patient A having a high risk for underlying cancer. Within the
“Technique” portion of the MRI, the reading radiologist compared the current test with Patient
A’s previous abdominal ultrasound (2/22/2017). Respondent did not review the comparison by the
radiologist. Respondent did not attempt to obtain or review the prior ultrasound and CT
examinations. Respondent also did not compare the MRI with the lesion within the pancreas with
the other studies.

4, On April 7, 2017, Patient obtained a second opinion, underwent an EUS guided
fine needle aspiration biopsy. Results of the endoscopic procedure was a finding of malignant
cells present, consistent with adenocarcinoma and metastic adenocarcinoma.
