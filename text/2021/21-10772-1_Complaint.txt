COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Robert G. Kilroy, Esq., General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Jeffrey Loren Johnson, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and
allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a Medical Doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 7412). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on April 27, 1995.

2. On August 31, 2009, Patient A? had a brain MRI without contrast to rule out a
possible brain tumor as ordered by Dr. Halthore, who treated Patient A after presenting to St. Rose
Dominican Hospital with complaints of nausea, headache, and vomiting.

3, On September 3, 2009, Respondent, acting as the diagnostic radiologist from

Dr. Halthore’s referral consultation, read Patient A’s brain MRI and noted “MRI of the brain

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Rachakonda Prabhu, M.D., Ms. Sandy Peltyn,
and Victor M. Muro, M.D.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

without contrast is within normal limits.” Respondent’s medical record of this MRI does not
mention the imaging sequences and does not indicate there was a 2 x 2 cm mass in the posterior
Foss abutting the fourth ventricle which could be seen on the axial T2 Flair and the axial T2 FSE
images. A lesion on Patient A’s brain is indicated on the MRI images. This MRI scan and

reading was Respondent’s only interaction with Patient A.

4, Respondent’s report (medical record) for Patient A includes the following:

FINDINGS: There is no hydrocephalus. No evidence of intracranial mass. No
morphologic abnormality of the brain is seen. There is no evidence for previous
hemorrhage. Flow-void is noted in the internal carotid and basilar arteries. No other
signal abnormality is seen;

IMPRESSION: MRI of the brain without contrast is within normal limits.

5. On July 28, 2013, Patient A presents to the University Medical Center Emergency
Room (UMC) for progressively worsening symptoms of headaches in the morning, dizziness after
sitting up, and vomiting. A subsequent MRI brain scan with and without contrast showed a large
tumor with obstructive hydrocephalus in the exact location as it did within the Respondent’s MRI
scan reading. Patient A at UMC had tumor resected.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) (Malpractice)

6. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

7. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

8. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

9. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he provided medical services to Patient A based upon his failure to identify the mass on the
September 3, 2009 MRI, and his failure to order a follow-up MRI brain scan with contrast.

provided in NRS 630.352.
COUNT I
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) (Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records)

11. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

12. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

13. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to document his actions when he treated Patient A.
Therefore, Respondent’s medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete,
because the records for Patient A were inaccurate due to his missed diagnosis of a brain tumor.

14. _ By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT Il
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) (Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation)

15. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

16. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

17. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.

18. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition. Further, Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care provider to
address the aforementioned worsening conditions. This type of consultation could have enhanced

Patient A’s declining medical condition giving Respondent additional important data so he could
properly read the MRI with contrast for an assessment of a possible brain tumor.
