COUNT I
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) (Violation of Standards of Practice)

3. All of the allegations in the preceding paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

4, Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

5. Pursuant to NAC 630.187, the Board adopted by reference the Model Policy on the
Use of Opioid Analgesics in the Treatment of Chronic Pain, July 2013, published by the
Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States, Inc. (Model Policy).

6. Pursuant to NAC 630.230(1)(k), a licensee shall not engage in the practice of
writing prescriptions for controlled substances to treat acute pain or chronic pain in a manner that
deviates from the Model Policy.

7. Patient A had a reported history of a brain aneurysm and chronic headaches,
chronic neck and back pain, attributed to her work for a parcel delivery service. Patient A had
previously been prescribed opioids for pain, and was referred to Respondent by another provider
in November 2016 for pain management.

8. In November 2016, Respondent began regularly prescribing to Patient A various
opioid medications for pain control, including: oxycodone/acetaminophen 10-325 mg, 120 ct.,
30 days (November 2016 through September 2018); Belbuca 300 mcg film, 60 ct., 30 days,
hydromorphone 4 mg, 28 ct., 7 days, and hydromorphone 8 mg, 90 ct., 30 days (November 2018);
hydrocodone/acetaminophen 10-325 mg, 56 ct., 14 days, and oxycodone/acetaminophen 10-325
mg, 108 ct., 18 days (December 2019). Also, in January 2019, Respondent began prescribing
oxycodone/acetaminophen 10-325 mg, 180 ct., 30 days (January 2019 through July 2019), which
is a morphine milligram equivalent (MME) of 90 per day and constitutes high-dose opioid
therapy.

9. Respondent prescribed to Patient A 90 MME per day, and for more than 90 days
(January 2019 through July 2019), without establishing the medical necessity of such a high-dose

of opioid therapy. Respondent failed to develop a revised treatment plan.

10. Respondent failed to conduct any detailed neurologic or musculoskeletal
examinations that would establish an indication for Patient A to receive long-term, high-dose
opioid medication for pain control.

11. Respondent failed to recommend other conservative treatments before or
concurrent with high-dose opioid therapy, including but not limited to, physical therapy, exercise
and movement, or massage therapy, among others, which may have alleviated these findings on
physical examination.

12. Pursuant to the Model Policy, a physician’s patient evaluation should include,
without limitation: complete medical history and physical examination targeted to the pain
condition, evaluation of the nature and intensity of the pain, and history of current and past
treatments, including interventional treatments. | Respondend consistently omitted such
information in Respondent’s medical records for Patient A.

13. Respondent’s records do not contain and show no indication of recent or
contemporaneous imaging (e.g. X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans) that would substantiate the need for
high-dose opioids for pain control.

14. Based on but not limited to the foregoing, Respondent wrote prescriptions to
Patient A for opioid analgesics to treat chronic pain in a manner that deviated from the Model
Policy.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
