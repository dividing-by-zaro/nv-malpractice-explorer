Respondent. By \L EXAMINERS

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this First Amended Complaint (Complaint) against Christina Lynne Kushnir, M.D.
(Respondent), a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC! has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the
Medical Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent was licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical
Practice Act, on June 7, 2012, and is currently licensed in active status (License No. 14396).

2. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On June 1, 2015, Patient A was seen at the Women’s Cancer Center of Nevada
(WCCN) for uterine fibroids and pelvic pain. Previously, Patient A had two prior open
myomectemies, diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity and a known history of severe adhesive
disease (well-documented within Respondent’s notes and Valley Health Systems). Patient A
consented for Respondent to perform an exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy,

and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Patient A’s preoperative level of creatinine was 0.89.

' Atthe time filing of the Complaint was approved, the IC was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chairman, Mr.
M, Neil Duxbury and Aury Nagy, M.D

Following the aforementioned procedure, Patient A’s incision was closed with a monocry! suture
when Respondent was present. Postoperatively, Patient A developed pneumonia and was placed
on antibiotics. Additionally, Patient A’s creatinine levels rose and all nephrotoxic agents were
discontinued.

4. On June 5, 2015, Respondent ordered a renal ultrasound due to Patient A’s elevated
serum creatinine levels, conducted Patient A’s abdominal examination, and at 7:13 p.m. later that
evening, Respondent documented such within the hospital entry progress notes. Patient's
creatinine reached a high of 1.72.

5. On June 6, 2015, Patient A was discharged following Respondent's renal
ultrasound that morning. Results of the aforementioned ultrasound indicated a mild
hydronephrosis, and the attending radiologist recommended a CT scan for further evaluation. The
medical records do not indicate whether Respondent knew of these results prior to Patient A’s
discharge.

6. On June 17, 2015, Respondent dictated her surgical report (of June 1, 2015
operation on Patient A) and commented the following: “I perform complicated cancer procedures
three days a week. In addition to that, I specialize in complicated benign GYN procedures
(May 24, 2015).” Details of this report differ from those recorded by the nursing staff, the treating
anesthesiologist and physicians involved in Patient A’s postoperative care. Specifically, the
Respondent’s report does not comment on the repair of a small bowel injury, nor does it indicate
completing a bilateral hypogastric artery ligation — all of which are well-documented in the
hospital records. Additionally, Respondent stated that she used monocryl sutures to close Patient
A’s incision, but her operative dictation done on June 1, 2015 states that staples were used to close
the incision on Patient A, contradictory to her prior statement.

COUNTI
NRS 630.3062 - Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records
7. Allof the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

reference as though fully set forth herein.

8. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds
for initiating discipline against a licensee.

9 Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to document her actions when she treated Patient A,
whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, or complete from June 1, 2015 through
Patient A’s discharge on June 6, 2015.

10. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT
NAC 630.210 - Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation

11, All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

12. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

13. NAC 630.210 requires a physician to seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.

14. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition of a “mild hydronephrosis” and disregarded the attending radiologist’s recommendation
of a “CT scan for further evaluation.” Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care
provider to address the doubtfulness of the aforementioned condition and recommendation of the
radiologist for a CT scan. This consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against her and give
her notice that she may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)

within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);
3. That the Board determines what sanctions to impose should it find and conclude
that there has been a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;
4. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,

conclusions of law and order, in writing, to include sanctions to be imposed; and
5. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these

premises.
