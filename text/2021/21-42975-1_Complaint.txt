COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through BRANDEE MOONEYHAN, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney
for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that IPPEI TAKAGI, M.D., (Respondent) violated
the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the
IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

I. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 15590). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on October 17, 2014.”

2. Patient A? was a seventy-two (72) year-old female at the time of the events at issue.

3. When Patient A experienced persistent back pain, her primary physician, in part,
ordered imaging of her lumbar spine and referred her to Dr. K,* a neurologist with whom
Respondent shared an office, for potential treatment of that pain.


1 The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chair,
Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, and Aury Nagy, M.D.

2 Respondent’s license is currently inactive.

3 Patient A’s identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy but is disclosed in the Patient Designation
served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

4 Respondent’s office mate is referred to by the initial letter of his last name for purposes of this Complaint.

4, Per the primary physician’s order, a radiologist performed magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) on Patient A’s lumbar spine on April 18, 2016. The resulting radiologist’s report

found:

Disc height normal L3-4 [the lumbar segment between the L3 and L4 vertebrae].
Degenerated facets. Very large caliber canal. No stenosis.

Grade 1 spondylolisthesis is 15% at L4-5 [the lumbar segment between the L4 and
LS vertebrae]. Mild to moderate degenerative disc disease. Severe hypertrophic
degenerative change involving the facets. Minor scoliotic curve. Moderate
narrowing of the lateral recesses. No central canal or foraminal stenosis.

Mild degenerative disc disease at the level of L5-S1 [the lumbosacral joint between
the L5 and S1 vertebrae]. Severely degenerated hypertrophic facets. Narrowing of
the right compared with the left lateral recess appears minor.

5. Patient A first met with Dr. K to discuss potential treatment on June 14, 2016. Dr.
K’s records of that meeting indicate that he reviewed Patient A’s recent lumbar MRI results, and
the “MRI showed evidence of spondylolisthesis at the L4-L5 level with the presence of severe

central and bilateral foraminal narrowing.” Dr. K’s records also state that he:

recommend[ed] proceeding with a surgical treatment consisting of a posterior
approach with transforaminal lumbar decompression and interbody fusion at L4-L5
L5-S1. To perform an adequate decompression and to address foraminal stenosis
with the nerve root compression, a wide decompression would be required
including removal of most of the facet joints bilaterally at the corresponding levels
which would cause iatrogenic instability at these levels. To prevent further
neurological deterioration and to address spinal instability an instrumented
stabilization and fusion would be required following the decompression.

Dr. K electronically signed the notes of his June 14, 2016, meeting with Patient A, and listed
himself as the only provider present.

6. On July 12, 2016, Patient A and Dr. K met again for a preoperative consultation.
Dr. K’s records state that Patient A was scheduled for “transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion at
L4-5,”> Dr. K electronically signed the notes of his July 12, 2016, meeting with Patient A, and
listed himself as the only provider present.

7. On July 19, 2016, Patient A met with Dr. K for another preoperative consultation.
Dr. K’s records indicate Patient A was “scheduled to undergo lumbar decompression and fusion

on the 29th of July.” During the July 19 meeting, Dr. K mentioned to Patient A it was “possible”

5 Dr. K and Patient A also discussed scheduling a separate surgery on portions of her cervical spine.

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


he might perform fusion on a second lumbar segment, depending on what he observed during the
surgery; Dr. K did not note in his records that fusing a second lumbar segment was a possibility,
nor that he discussed such a possibility with Patient A. Dr. K electronically signed the notes of his
July 29, 2016, meeting with Patient A, and listed himself as the only provider present.

8. Dr. K informed Patient A that he would be performing the decompression and
fusion of her L4-5 lumbar segment on July 29, 2016, at Spring Valley Hospital in Las Vegas,
Nevada.

9. On the evening of July 28, 2016, “Johany” from Dr. K’s office called Patient A at
home. Johany told Patient A that Dr. K had been called out of town for an emergency, and Patient
A’s surgery scheduled for the next morning would have to be postponed.

10. Johany later told Patient A that her planned lumbar surgery could be performed on
a new date—August 2, 2016—and at a different hospital—Summerlin Hospital Medical Center
(Summerlin Hospital), in Las Vegas, Nevada. Johany did not inform Patient A that her surgery
would be performed by a doctor other than Dr. K.

11. Throughout Patient A’s contact with Dr. K and his office staff up to August 2,
2016, Dr. K was the only physician who had met with, examined, and discussed the planned
decompression and fusion of her L4-5 lumbar segment with Patient A.

12. On the morning of August 2, 2016, Patient A presented to Summerlin Hospital for
the purpose of allowing Dr. K to perform a decompression and fusion at her L4-5 lumbar segment.

13. At Summerlin Hospital, prior to the surgery, Patient A was presented with several
documents to sign in order for the surgery to proceed, including a “Consent to Anesthesia,” a
“Consent to Blood Transfusion and Release of Liability,” and various electronic documents
regarding financial responsibility and her rights as a patient.

14. Among the documents Patient A was required to and did sign on August 2, 2016,
was a document entitled “Consent to Surgery and Other Invasive Procedures” (Consent Form),
which consisted of a preprinted form with fillable blank fields.

15. The completed item “1” on the Consent Form read:

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


I hereby authorize Dr. K'*! and such assistants and associates as
may be selected by him/her and Summerlin Hospital Medical
Center to perform the following procedure(s) upon myself

(underlines indicate language handwritten on the form).

16. The next section of the Consent Form read:

PROCEDURE(S) Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion four to five
(underlines indicate language handwritten on the form).

17. The Consent Form also contained a section entitled “Affirmation of Informed
Consent by Physician.” Although Dr. K’s name was handwritten on the form as the doctor being
authorized to perform the surgery, Respondent signed this portion of the Consent Form. On
information and belief, Respondent signed the form after Patient A signed it, and outside of
Patient A’s presence.

18. In the pre-operation room, Respondent presented himself to Patient A and
introduced himself as the person who would be performing her surgery.

19. Prior to Respondent introducing himself in the pre-operation room, Patient A had
never met Respondent.

20. | When Patient A asked where Dr. K was, Respondent responded that he and Dr. K
had “a system” as to which of them would meet with a patient immediately prior to surgery based
on which one of them arrived first at the hospital.

21. | Based on Respondent’s statement about the doctors’ “system,” both Patient A and
her adult daughter (the daughter), who accompanied Patient A to the hospital, believed that Dr. K
was on his way to the hospital to perform the planned surgery.

22. Respondent performed surgery on Patient A’s lumbar spine on August 2, 2016.

23. Dr. K did not perform or participate in the surgery and was never present in the
operating room on August 2, 2016.

24. Patient A wished for Dr. K to perform her surgery and would have chosen to delay
her surgery if she knew Dr. K would not be performing it.


6 Dr. K’s name was spelled out on the form.

25. Respondent recognized that he would receive greater financial compensation if he
performed Patient A’s surgery on August 2, 2016, than if the surgery were canceled or delayed.

26. In addition to performing a decompression and fusion at the L4-5 lumbar segment
in accordance with Patient A’s preoperative discussions with Dr. K and her execution of a
Consent Form listing “transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion four to five” as the only procedure
to which she consented, Respondent fused two additional lumbar segments, specifically, the
segments between Patient A’s L3 and L4 vertebrae (L3-4), and the segment between her L2 and
L3 vertebrae (L2-3).

27. Patient A also signed a “Summerlin Medical Center Patient Self Determination
Record” form designating the daughter as her “appointed healthcare surrogate having
[Patient A’s] durable power of attorney for healthcare.”

28. During the surgery, an unknown person believed to be a nurse, called the daughter
on her cellular phone twice, asking the daughter’s permission to fuse an additional segment of
Patient A’s lumbar spine.

29. In the first phone call to the daughter, the daughter specifically stated that she
deferred to the judgment of Dr. K if he believed the second fusion was necessary.

30. The daughter was surprised and dismayed to receive another call asking for
permission to fuse a third segment, as neither she nor her mother had been informed that a third
fusion was even a possibility; however, she again stated that she deferred to the judgment of Dr. K
regarding her mother’s surgery.

31. Patient A’s preoperative MRI report indicated that the disc height at Patient A’s

bbl

L3-4 lumbar segment was “normal” and showed “[n]Jo stenosis.” Her preoperative MRI did not
mention her L2-3 segment at all.

32. Dr. K’s records of his preoperative meetings with Patient A mentioned only her
L4-5 and L5-S1 spinal segments, and did not mention her L3-4 or L2-3 segments.

33. | Respondent completed and electronically signed an “Operative Record” of Patient

A’s August 2, 2016, surgery.

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


34. | The Operative Record listed Dr. K, not Respondent, as the physician “attending”
the surgery.

35. In the Operative Record, Respondent listed Patient A’s “PREOPERATIVE
DIAGNOSIS” as “Lumbar spondylolisthesis and instability and stenosis at L4-5”; and her
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS” as “Same plus spondylosis and instability and facet
arthropathy at L2-3 and L3-4.”

36. Respondent further recorded in the Operative Record: “The [facet] joints at L3-4
were checked and found to be unstable. The [facet] joints at L2-3 were also found to be unstable.”
Respondent did not explain how the facet joints were “checked.”

37. Respondent falsely stated in the Operative Record that he had
“Tp]reoperatively ... discussed with the patient and family the possibility of extension of fusion
depending on intraoperative findings.” Only Dr. K had ever mentioned to Patient A that it was
“possible” that Dr. K might fuse a single additional lumbar segment based on what he saw during
the surgery.

38. | A neurosurgeon ordinarily would not “check” the stability of facet joints during a
surgery being performed on another spinal segment, and the appearance of facet joints alone is not
sufficient to support a clinical determination regarding their stability. Respondent’s note that the
joints were “checked” in the midst of surgery and “found to be unstable” is not sufficient
justification for a reasonable neurosurgeon to fuse a lumbar segment.

39. Neither the preoperative MRI, nor Dr. K’s records, nor Respondent’s recorded
intraoperative observations demonstrate a medically necessary basis to fuse the L3-4 or L2-3
segments of Patient A’s lumbar spine.

40. Fusing three lumber segments instead of one substantially increased the amount
charged for Patient A’s surgery and the amount Respondent hoped to be paid, and on information
and belief, was paid, for performing the surgery.

41. Shortly after the surgery was complete on August 2, 2016, Respondent met with
the daughter. When the daughter asked where Dr. K was, Respondent lied to her, stating that Dr.

K had “snuck out the back door,” when Dr. K had never been present.

42. Respondent’s lie was calculated to make the daughter believe the falsehood that Dr.

K was present and had participated in Patient A’s surgery.
COUNT I
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(1) — Engaging in Conduct Intended to Deceive

43. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

44. NRS 630.306(1)(b)(1) provides that “engaging in any conduct, which is intended to
deceive” constitute grounds for initiating disciplinary action against a physician.

45.  Respondent’s statement that he and Dr. K had a “system” for which of them would
speak to patients prior to surgery based on which “showed up first” was calculated to make
Patient A believe that Dr. K was on his way to the procedure, which Respondent knew was false.

46.  Respondent’s statement that Dr. K had “snuck out the back door” was calculated to
make the daughter believe that Dr. K had participated in Patient A’s surgery, which Respondent
knew was false.

47. By knowingly making statements designed to induce Patient A and/or the daughter
to believe information he knew to be false, Respondent engaged in conduct intended to deceive
Patient A and the daughter.

48. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(7) — Engaging in Conduct That Violates the Trust of a Patient and Exploits
the Relationship With the Patient for Financial or Other Personal Gain

49. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

50. NRS 630.307(7) provides that “engaging in conduct that violates the trust of the
patient and exploits the relationship between the physician and the patient for financial or other

personal gain” constitutes grounds for initiating discipline against a physician.

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL



51. | Respondent’s statement that he and Dr. K had a “system” for which of them would
speak to patients prior to surgery based on which “showed up first” was calculated to make
Patient A believe that Dr. K, with whom she was comfortable and whom she repeatedly asked for
on the day of the surgery, was on his way to the procedure, in order to persuade her to proceed
with the surgery, and thus ensure that Respondent was paid for performing the surgery.

52. Respondent was able to make the deceptive comment about the doctors’ alleged
“system” by capitalizing on his role as Dr. K’s practice partner and, in turn, on Patient A’s trust in
Dr. K, and thus Respondent violated Patient A’s trust and exploited the relationship between
Dr. K and Patient A in order to realize a financial gain for himself.

53. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT Tl
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

54. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

55. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

56. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

57. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when he fused Patient A’s L3-4 and L2-3 vertebrae without adequate
evidence that such additional fusions were medically necessary.

58. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT IV
NRS 630.301(7) — Engaging in Conduct That Violates the Trust of a Patient and Exploits
the Relationship With the Patient for Financial or Other Personal Gain

59. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

60. NRS 630.307(7) provides that “engaging in conduct that violates the trust of the
patient and exploits the relationship between the physician and the patient for financial or other
personal gain” constitutes grounds for initiating discipline against a physician.

61. By unnecessarily fusing two (2) additional lumbar segments and obtaining
acquiescence to perform them by capitalizing on the patient’s trust and deference to Dr. K—
whose participation he had misrepresented—thereby increasing the cost of the surgery and his
corresponding compensation; Respondent engaged in conduct that violated Patient A’s trust and
exploited the relationship between Patient A and Dr. K to realize a financial gain for himself.

62. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
