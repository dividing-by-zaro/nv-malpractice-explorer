ORDER in this matter, as follows:

FINDINGS OF FACT

I.

Respondent held a license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada issued by the Board

Il.

On February 1, 2021, the Investigative Committee filed its formal Complaint in
Case No. 21-8734-1, alleging Respondent violated the Medical Practice Act. Respondent was
served with the Complaint on February 18, 2021, at his address of record with the Board.
Pursuant to NRS 630.254, each licensee shall maintain a permanent mailing address with the
board to which all communications from the Board to the licensee must be sent. A licensee who
changes his or her permanent mailing address shall notify the Board in writing of the new
permanent mailing address within 30 days after the change.

The Complaint alleges two (2) violations of the Medical Practice Act that constitute
grounds for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee, as follows: one (1) violation of
NRS 630.306(1)(c), Unlawful Prescribing of Controlled Substances and Dangerous Drugs (Count
1); and one (1) violation of NRS 630.305(1)(e), Aiding and Assisting the Unlicensed Practice of
Medicine (Count II). Respondent did not answer or file a response to the allegations set forth in

it

Pursuant to NRS 622A.350(1) and (2), as Respondent did not appear and as a continuance
had not been scheduled, sought or granted, Mr. Fricke made an offer of proof on the record that
Respondent was given sufficient legal notice. Upon a determination by the regulatory body or
hearing panel or officer that the absent party was given sufficient legal notice, the regulatory body
or hearing panel or officer may proceed to consider and dispose of the case without the
participation of the absent party. Based thereon, good cause appearing, the Hearing Officer found
that sufficient legal notice had been provided to the Respondent, and therefore found that the
Board may accept the IC’s allegations against the Respondent in the Complaint as true.

Notwithstanding the presumption afforded the Board pursuant to NRS 622A.350(2),
Mr. Fricke presented the IC’s case in its entirety, thus establishing a record for the Board to
review the case on the merits.

The Hearing Officer provided the Findings and Recommendations, filed
October 21, 2021. This matter was scheduled for final adjudication on December 3, 2021, at a
regularly scheduled Board meeting.

The notice of the adjudication was sent via USPS Certified Mail on October 27, 2021, and
was delivered on Respondent’s address of record on November 1, 2021, at 1:52 p.m.

A copy of the adjudication materials along with a copy of the Hearing Officer’s Findings
and Recommendation, were mailed via USPS Certified Mail on November 2, 2021, and were
delivered to Respondent’s address of record on November 5, 2021, at 3:35 p.m.

V.

Pursuant to NRS 622A.300(5)(a), the Findings and Recommendations of the Hearing
Officer are hereby approved and adopted by the Board, in their entirety and without modification,
and are hereby specifically incorporated and made part of this Order by reference. A copy of the
Findings and Recommendations filed October 21, 2021, in this matter is attached hereto as
Exhibit 1.

VI.
The Board hereby finds that Counts I and II, as set forth in the Complaint, and as

recapitulated in Paragraph II above, have been established by a preponderance of the evidence.

VII.
If any of the foregoing Findings of Fact is more properly deemed a Conclusion of Law, it

may be so construed.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

I.

The Board has jurisdiction over Respondent and the Complaint, and an adjudication of this

matter by the Board members as set forth herein is proper.
Il.

Respondent was timely and properly served with the Complaint, and all notices and orders
in advance of the hearing and adjudication thereon, in accordance with NRS and NAC
Chapters 630, NRS Chapters 241, 622A and 233B, and all legal requirements of due process.

Ill.

With respect to the allegations of the Complaint, the Board concludes that Respondent has
violated the Medical Practice Act, as alleged in the Complaint, as follows: one (1) violation of
NRS 630.306(1)(c), Unlawful Prescribing of Controlled Substances and Dangerous Drugs (Count
I); and one (1) violation of NRS 630.305(1)(e), Aiding and Assisting the Unlicensed Practice of
Medicine (Count II). Accordingly, Respondent is subject to discipline pursuant to NRS 630.352.

IV.

The Board finds that, pursuant to NRS 622.400, recovery from Respondent of reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigation and disciplinary
proceedings against Respondent is appropriate. The Board has reviewed the Investigative
Committee’s Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements and Attorneys’ Fees, and the Board finds
them to be the actual fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigative,
administrative and disciplinary proceedings against Respondent, and finds them to be reasonable
and necessary based on: (1) the abilities, training, education, experience, professional standing
and skill demonstrated by Board staff and attorneys; (2) the character of the work done, its
difficulty, its intricacy, its importance, the time and skill required, the responsibility imposed and

the prominence and character of the parties where, as in this case, they affected the importance of

the litigation; (3) the work actually performed by the Board’s attorneys and staff, and the skill,
time and attention given to that work; and (4) the product of the work and benefits to the Board
and the people of Nevada that were derived therefrom.

V.

If any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law is more properly deemed a Finding of Fact, it
may be so construed.

ORDER

Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, and good cause
appearing therefore,

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:

1. Pursuant to NRS 630.352(4)(e), the Board shall administer a written public
reprimand to Respondent.

2. Pursuant to NRS 630.352(4)(d), Respondent’s license to practice medicine is
hereby revoked. In accord with NRS 622A.410(1), the Board hereby prescribes a period of two
(2) years, during which Respondent may not apply for reinstatement of this license;

3. Pursuant to NRS 630.352(4)(h), Respondent is hereby ordered to pay a fine of two
thousand five-hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per violation of the Medical Practice Act, for a total
fine in the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), to be paid within sixty (60) days of
service of this Order; and

FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

TO: Aaron Bart Fricke
Senior Deputy General Counsel

9600 Gateway Drive
Reno, Nevada 89521

Abdel Malick Khalek, M.D.
320 N. Nellis Blvd., Ste 6
Las Vegas, NV 89509

This matter came for hearing on August 26, 2021. Present were Aaron Fricke, Esq. on
behalf of the Investigative Committee (the “IC”) and the undersigned hearing officer. Respondent
Abdel Malick Khalek, M.D. (“Dr. Khalek”) did not appear nor otherwise participate.

Notice to Dr. Khalek was confirmed on the record. Specifically, proof was submitting
indicating that the Scheduling Order, filed May 12, 2021, which contained notice of the hearing
was sent by certified mail to Dr. Khalek at his last known address on file with the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners (the “Board”). See NRS 630.254; NRS 630.255; NRS 630.344; and
Volume 1, Exhibits 6-7. While Dr. Khalek had communications with the Board, the record

indicates that he did not provide an alternative address, was aware of the proceedings, and did not



engage in the proceedings despite several notices and attempts to contact him.' See Volume 1,
Exhibits 1-11. No continuance of the hearing was requested by any interested party.
With Dr. Khalek having failed to appear and no continuance having been requested nor

granted, the matter was heard as scheduled pursuant to NRS 622A.350, which provides:

1. If a party fails to appear at a scheduled hearing and a continuance
has not been scheduled or granted, any party who is present at the hearing may
make an offer of proof that the absent party was given sufficient legal notice. Upon
a determination by the regulatory body or hearing panel or officer that the absent
party was given sufficient legal notice, the regulatory body or hearing panel or
officer may proceed to consider and dispose of the case without the participation of
the absent party.

2. Ifthe licensee fails to appear at a hearing, the regulatory body or
hearing panel or officer may accept the allegations against the licensee in the
charging document as true.

As well as pursuant to NAC 630.470(2), which provides: “If a licensee fails to appear at a
scheduled hearing and no continuance has been requested and granted, the evidence may be heard
and the matter may be considered and disposed of on the basis of the evidence before the Board,
panel or hearing officer in the manner required by this section.”

In so proceeding, undersigned heard evidence from the IC in support of the Complaint
allegations that consist of: Count I, NRS 630.306(1)(c), Unlawful Prescribing of Controlled
Substance and Dangerous Drug; and Count II, NRS 630.305(1)(e), Aiding and Assisting the
Unlicensed Practice of Medicine, premised upon controlled substances being addressed by
unlicensed practitioner Vinay Kumar Bararia, M.D. by and through credentials held by Dr.
Khalek. Through sworn testimony of Senior Investigator for the Nevada State Board of Medical
Examiners Kim Friedman, and through the admission of Volume 1, Exhibits 1-11 and Volume II,

Exhibits 1-16, the IC established as follows:

"In this respect, there are no filings in the record on behalf of Dr. Khalek including, but not limited to, an Answer to
the Complaint.



1. Dr. Khalek was employed by Goldsmith Healthcare, Ltd., a medical clinic located
in Las Vegas, Nevada, which was sold to Nevada Health Services, LLC in August 2018. See
Volume II, Exhibit 14.

2. Nevada Health Services, LLC did business as “TrimCare” and was owned and
operated by Vinay Kumar Bararia, M.D. (“Bararia’”), who had surrendered his Nevada medical
license in March 2013, in the midst of an indictment in the State of Arizona for seven counts of
violating 21 USC §841 and §846 and conspiring to distribute controlled substances, possession of
controlled substances with the intent to distribute, and distribution of controlled substances. In
relation to such charges, Bararia was convicted on September 18, 2014 of two counts of
Distribution of a Controlled Substance, a violation of 21 USC §841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(c). See
Volume II, Exhibits 2, 4, 6, and 7.

3. Financial dealings beyond an employer/employee relationship occurred as between
Bararia and Dr. Khalek whereby Dr. Khalek provided Bararia with a cashier’s check for $75,000
issued on October 16, 2018, approximately two months after Bararia’s purchase of Goldsmith
Healthcare, Ltd. See Volume II, Exhibit 14, Exhibit B. Dr. Khalek indicates the money was
provided to Bararia as a loan in support of Bararia’s purchase of Goldsmith Healthcare, Ltd.;
however, evidence provided by Dr. Khalek and submitted the IC indicates that the sums were
provided in contemplation of a 50/50 partnership in Nevada Health Services, LLC (DBA
TrimCare), which is supported by the purchase price for Goldsmith Healthcare, Ltd. being
$150,000, of which the money provided by Dr. Khalek equals exactly half. See Volume II,
Exhibit 14, Exhibits C and D, see also the August 26, 2021, Transcript of Hearing Proceedings,
pp. 105-107. The partnership was never finalized in writing and, in November 2018, Bararia
agreed to repay the $75,000 to Dr. Khalek. See Volume II, Exhibit 14, Exhibit D.

4. Dr. Khalek continued to work for Nevada Health Services, LLC through April
2019 when he quit. See Exhibit 14.

2 This figure was stated in argument and not testified to. See the August 26, 2021, Transcript of Hearing Proceedings,
p. 19.



5. Commencing in late 2018 and through early 2019, prior to leaving Nevada Health
Services, LLC, Dr. Khalek began to lodge complaints against Bararia with regulatory agencies
such as the Board and the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy, alleging “multiple felonies” being
committed by Bararia, which included, but was not limited to, practicing medicine without a
license and unlawful distribution of controlled substances. See, e,g., Volume II, Exhibit 11; the
August 26, 2021, Transcript of Hearing Proceedings, pp. 63-67.

6. Dr. Khalek reported that Bararia was meeting and treating patients unsupervised by
a licensed physician and in so doing was improperly utilizing Dr. Khalek’s credentials and access
to distribute and prescribe controlled substances. Id. Dr. Khalek was aware of the same but failed
to stop Bararia from doing so by not seeking to eliminate Bararia’s access to the controlled
substances for which Dr. Khalek was responsible and by failing to report his dispensing
credentials as compromised, amongst other possible remedies Dr. Khalek could have availed
himself of. Id. and the August 26, 2021, Transcript of Hearing Proceedings, pp. 67-69.

7. Prescription Monitoring Reports related to Nevada Health Services, LLC dated
09/01/2018 to 06/04/2019 indicate that 657 prescriptions for controlled substances were issued
and attributed to 358 patients of which Dr. Khalek could only account for 57 of the patients. See
Volume II, Exhibits 14-16. Dr. Khalek reported that he does “not know how the remaining
patients may have obtained prescriptions dispensed under his name,” but this is belied by Dr.
Khalek’s own reports of Bararia improperly dispensing and prescribing controlled substances and
Bararia having Dr. Khalek’s credential information such as Dr. Khalek’s DEA licensing number.
See, e.g., Volume II, Exhibits 8 and 11. Dr. Khalek also indicates that he did not want to disturb
the status quo, sort to speak, with Bararia pending being paid back the $75,000. See Volume II,
Exhibit 16.

8. Records submitted and testified to further support that Bararia was permitted to
purchase controlled substances for distribution by using of Dr. Khalek’s credentials, which Dr.
Khalek would have had to provide to Bararia. See Volume II, Exhibits 8-12; the August 26, 2021,

Transcript of Hearing Proceedings, pp. 48-57.



9. Testimony was further provided by Ms. Friedman that Dr. Khalek admitted to her
that he was aware of Bararia treating patients without supervision despite not being properly
licensed or supervised; writing prescriptions for patients seen by Bararia without having seen the
patients himself; allowing Bararia to have a key to the controlled substance storage area that held
controlled substances that were the charge of Dr. Khalek; and Nevada Health Services, LLC staff
having access to an e-prescribing phone whereby controlled substances were prescribed under Dr.
Khalek’s credentials. See the August 26, 2021, Transcript of Hearing Proceedings, pp. 63-66.

WHEREFORE the undersigned hearing officer finds as follows:

Proper notice of the proceedings, inclusive of the evidentiary hearing, was provided to Dr.
Khalek and no continuance of the evidentiary hearing was sought nor granted;

Pursuant to NRS 622A.350(2) the undersigned accepts the allegations against Dr. Khalek
in the Complaint, filed February 1, 2001, as true;

Aside from the authority granted by NRS 622A.350(2), the undersigned hearing officer
finds that the IC established a violation of Count I, NRS 630.306(1)(c), Unlawful Prescribing of
Controlled Substance and Dangerous Drug, by establishing, as alleged, that Dr. Khalek allowed
Bararia to have access to, dispense, and prescribe controlled substances to patients with whom Dr.
Khalek had no bona fide therapeutic relationship by using Dr. Khalek’s access and credentials,
and that Dr. Khalek further failed to monitor and evidence such transactions in accordance with
required reporting and record keeping, which compounded the improprieties engaged in by Dr.
Khalek with respect thereto. The foregoing establishes that Dr. Khalek administered, dispensed,
or prescribed controlled substances to others in a manner not authorized by law as contemplated
by NRS 630.306(1)(c).

Aside from the authority granted by NRS 622A.350(2), the undersigned hearing officer
finds that the IC established a violation of Count II, NRS 630.305(1)(e), Aiding and Assisting the
Unlicensed Practice of Medicine, by establishing that Dr. Khalek furnished his credentials to
Bararia, an unlicensed person, and knowingly permitted Bararia to utilize the same in treating and
dispensing and otherwise prescribing to patients controlled substances nor tracked nor otherwise

managed by Dr. Khalek as was Dr. Khalek’s obligation. The foregoing establishes that Dr.




Khalek aided and assisted Bararia, an unlicensed person, to engage in the practice of medicine
contrary to law.

BASED UPON THE FOREGOING, it is recommended that the Board find Dr. Khalek in
violation of NRS 630.306(1)(c), Unlawful Prescribing of Controlled Substance and Dangerous
Drug, as alleged in Count I of the Complaint field on February 1, 2021; and NRS 630.305(1)(e),
Aiding and Assisting the Unlicensed Practice of Medicine, as alleged in Count II of the Complaint
filed on February 1, 2021.

RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED this 18th day of October 2021.
