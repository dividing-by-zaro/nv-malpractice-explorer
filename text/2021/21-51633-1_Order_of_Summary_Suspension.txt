11. | On information and belief, Licensee’s failure to comply with the IC’s Order is
knowing and willful.

12. Licensee’s conduct, as alleged herein and in the Complaint, is not only
unprofessional, but demonstrates an intent to evade the Board’s investigatory processes and to
conceal illegal activities that endanger the public safety.

13. Licensee’s conduct is wholly incompatible with maintaining an active license to
practice medicine as a physician assistant in the State of Nevada.

14. Based upon the foregoing, on July 19, 2021, this IC has reasonably determined that
the health, safety, or welfare of the public and any patient served by Licensee is at risk of
imminent and continued harm.

Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the license to practice medicine, as a physician
assistant, in the State of Nevada of Tammy Lynn Hankins, PA-C (License No. PA2277), is
