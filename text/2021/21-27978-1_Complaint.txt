COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through SARAH A. BRADLEY, J.D., Deputy Executive Director and attorney for
the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that ALI KIA, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 11940). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 7, 2006.

2. Patient A? was a twenty-nine (29) year-old female at the time of the events at
issue.>

3. On or about July 9, 2016, Patient A was admitted to Sunrise Hospital and Medical
Center (Sunrise Hospital) for a cesarean delivery of her fourth child. On July 10, 2016, she was

discharged from Sunrise Hospital.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Aury Nagy, M.D.,
and Mr. M. Neil Duxbury.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3 Patient A turned thirty (30) years old on July 15, 2016 while she was hospitalized at Sunrise Hospital and
Medical Center.

4. Subsequently, on July 14, 2016, Patient A was admitted to Sunrise Hospital’s
Emergency Department for severe abdominal pain.

5. Patient A was under the care of Respondent during her hospitalization from
July 14, 2016 to July 16, 2016 because he was the hospitalist.

6. When she was first examined on July 14, 2016, Patient A’s medical records reflect
the following regarding her abdomen: “epigastric tenderness, no ri[g]idity, no peritoneal signs
small bowel obstruction, free fluid, possible intra-abdominal abscesses.”

7. Patient A received a computed tomography (CT) scan of her abdomen and pelvis
on July 14, 2016 which showed: (a) “Gas and fluid distension of stomach and proximal small
bowel compatible with small bowel obstruction” and (b) “Moderate amount of free fluid in the
abdomen and pelvis with several small gas bubbles anterior to the uterus. Intraperitoneal abscess
suspected.”

8. On July 14, 2016, Patient A’s evaluation showed leukocytosis as a primary clinical
impression with anemia, hypokalemia, partial bowel obstruction, sepsis, and status post cesarean
section as secondary impressions.

9. Leukocytosis is not a normal symptom or a result of post-cesarean deliveries.

10. Patient A’s white blood cell count (WBC) on July 14, 2016 was 19,700 WBCs per
mcL, and it climbed to 20,600 WBCs per mcL, the next day, on July 15, 2016. This is much
higher than the usual post-cesarean increase, the average increase of a patient’s white blood count
after a cesarean delivery is about 22%.

11. | Records for Patient A dictated by Respondent on July 14, 2016 state “We will
admit the patient under my service to medical surgical unit. . . . We will keep the patient nothing
by mouth, IV fluid hydration, NG tube if need be, and repeat radiographic imaging of the
abdomen.”

12. Patient A’s medical records show that only one CT scan was performed on
July 14, 2016.

13. As of July 15, 2016, Patient A received 3,050 ccs of fluid via an intravenous line

(IV) over the course of twenty-four (24) hours.

14. Patient A was not taking any fluid or food orally.

15. On July 15, 2016, Patient A continued to complain of abdominal pain, indicated
that she was not feeling better, reported that she was not passing gas, and had not had a bowel
movement.

16. Patient A was also experiencing nausea and vomiting, and was treated with
ondanestron HCI via IV at 8:37 p.m. on July 15, 2016.

17. A physical examination of Patient A’s abdomen on July 15, 2016 revealed
“abnormal bowel sounds, distended (NO RIGIDITY), no rebound.”

18. On July 15, 2016, Respondent notes in Patient A’s medical records that she was not
passing gas, had not had a bowel movement, yet he recommended Patient A try clear liquids that
evening to the following night, with her discharge to occur on July 16, 2016.

19. | Despite an abdominal X-ray on July 14, 2016, showing persistant small bowel
obstruction without further imaging and continued nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain,
Respondent discharged Patient A with antibiotics and Senokot for constipation, with instructions
to follow up with her obstetrician for further care.

20. Respondent indicated in Patient A’s medical records that he discussed Patient A’s
case with Patient A’s obstetrician by telephone and general surgeon and that they both concurred
with the discharge of Patient A.

21. Patient A’s medical record does not show any documentation or notes from
Patient A’s obstetrician or the general surgeon.

22. On July 16, 2016, Patient A was discharged from Sunrise Hospital with

constipation as the diagnosis.

23. | The CT scan findings for Patient A were not consistent with constipation.
24. No rectal examination was done to indicate presence of stool in the rectum.
25. | Only one CT scan was done for Patient A, and further imaging is recommended to

manage a small bowel obstruction.
26. Respondent stated that his discharge plan was discussed with Patient A who agreed

with the plan.

27. On July 17, 2016, the day after being discharged from Sunrise Hospital, Patient A
was admitted to Centennial Hills Hospital Medical Center.
28. | While at Centennial Hills Hospital Medical Center, Patient A had an exploratory

laparotomy performed on July 18, 2016.

29. She was then diagnosed with an infarcted omentum which required a partial
omentectomy.
30. Patient A had a complication of respiratory failure requiring ventilator support for

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

31. After multiple additional complications, Patient A was transferred to a long-term
acute care (LTAC) facility for further care on September 2, 2016.

32. Respondent’s management of Patient A’s small bowel obstruction during her
hospitalization on July 14, 2016 to July 16, 2016 deviated from the standard of care.

33. The standard of care for management of small bowel obstruction is to monitor the

patient for seventy-two (72) hours with repeated imaging needed to show resolution of the

obstruction.
34. A nalogastric tube is recommended for decompression of the gut.
35. Before discharge, Patient A should have had documented flatus, bowel movements,

and adequate oral intake.

36. Patient A’s persistent abdominal pain, symptoms and imaging consistent with a
bowel obstruction, leukocytosis, continued nausea and vomiting, and suggestion of an abscess
warranted a formal surgical consultation.

37. The lack of a formal consultation by the general surgeon made Respondent the sole
physician responsible for Patient A during her hospitalization.

38. | Respondent’s failure to properly manage Patient A’s bowel obstruction led to a
delay in her diagnosis and proper treatment.

39. As aresult, Patient A experienced a more complicated hospitalization, which could
have been avoided.
