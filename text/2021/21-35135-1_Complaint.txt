Respondent. JUL 70 2021
NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
MEDICAL EXAMINERS
COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Robert G. Kilroy, Esq., Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the
IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Douglas Jackson Fife, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 13164). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 1, 2009.

2. On April, 7, 2015, Patient A? presented to Respondent with a history of multiple
skin cancers. Due to Patient A’s rapidly growing scalp lesion on his forehead, Respondent
recommended a Mohs procedure be performed to remove it. On April 14, 2015, Patient A
underwent the Mohs procedure were performed by Respondent and his Physician Assistant in
three (3) stages. Respondent supervised his Physician Assistant (PA) for the surgical removal of

the scalp lesion tumor (squamous cell carcinoma). Respondent planned the flap, lifted the flap,

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D., Ms. Sandy
Peltyn and Victor M. Muro, M.D.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient

and cauterized the wound at the subcutaneous skin level. The medical records do not indicate
whether Respondent or his PA cleaned the wound and placed the subcutaneous sutures for closure
of the surgical site. Medical records do not note whether any type of surgical gauze was used,
who used it and whether Respondent or his PA placed the gauze within Patient A’s wound on this
date.

3, On April, 21, 2015, Patient A returned to Respondent for suture removal.
Respondent noted Patient A’s surgical area was swelling and the elevation of the skin overlying
the sutured wound had some fluctuance. On April 29, 2015, Respondent drained Patient A’s
wound, which had less swelling compared from the April 21, 2015 encounter, and recommended
antibiotics for, what he presumed to be, a post-op infection. Despite the treatment, Patient A’s
wound continued to swell. From May 6 through May 19, 2015, Respondent maintained a follow-
up of Patient A’s surgical closure site.

4. On May 27, 2015, Patient A’s wound got worse and discharged purulent liquid.
Based upon the purulent discharge, Respondent opened Patient A’s unhealed surgical site to
investigate the cause of the discharge. He found and removed the three (3) pieces of surgical
gauze left behind within the surgical site and had been inside Patient A’s forehead since the initial
surgery of April 14, 2015.

5. The medical records for Patient A are unclear as to who placed the surgical gauze
in the lesion wound, and/or, who failed to remove the surgical gauze following the Mohs
micrographic surgery making identification of the person who caused the error ambiguous.
However, it is clear that Respondent was responsible for the patient and responsible for the actions
of his PA before, during and after the surgery.

6. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

8. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

9. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he provided medical services to Patient A, because i) he failed to supervise his PA during the
Moh’s surgery; ii) he failed to remove or instruct his PA to remove the surgical gauze prior to
closing Patient A’s wound; and, iii) he failed to diagnose Patient A’s swelling as the entrapment or
retention of the surgical gauze that he failed to remove such foreign bodies during the April 14,
2015 procedure.

10. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

12. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by reference
as though fully set forth herein.

13. A physician is subject to discipline for violating of NRS 630.301 through 630.3065
inclusive, pursuant to NAC 630.380(1)(m). |

14. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

15. Pursuant to NAC 630.230(1)(i), prohibited professional conduct, states that a person
who is licensed as a physician shall not fail to provide adequate supervision of a physician assistant
who is supervised by the physician.

16. Respondent failed to provide adequate supervision when he did not properly
manage his physician assistant’s activities during Patient A’s surgery. Specifically, Respondent
failed to supervise his PA before, during and after the surgery because there was surgical gauze
left behind in Patient A’s forehead wound unintentionally for several weeks.

17. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

provided in NRS 630.352.
