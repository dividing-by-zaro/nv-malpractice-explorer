In the Matter of Charges and Complaint | Case No. 19-21834-1

Against: FILED
TERRANCE J. KWIATKOWSKI, M.D., FEB 12 2021
By:
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this First Amended Complaint (Complaint) against Terrance J. Kwiatkowski, M.D.
(Respondent), a licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC! has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the
Medical Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent was licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical
Practice Act, on August 27, 2001, and is currently licensed in active status (License No. 9962).

2. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but was
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of the Complaint
filed January 31, 2019.

3. On July 1, 2014, Patient A presented to the Desert Springs Hospital Emergency
Room (ER) with a complaint of right facial swelling and a diagnosis of parotitis, and was
subsequently discharged with oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin) and pain medications. On
July 2, 2014, Patient A returned to Desert Springs Hospital ER with a complaint of worsening

symptoms, and was transferred to Sunrise Hospital for an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist

* At the time filing of the Complaint was approved, the IC was composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D.,
Chairman, Michael J. Fischer, M.D., and Ms. Valerie J Clark,

consult, Patient A was started on IV antibiotics (Clindamycin) and a CT scan indicated a parotid
edema on the right side and a three (3) millimeter stone in the parotid duct on the same side.
4. On July 5, 2014, Patient A presented to Respondent, who recommended

intravenous steroids and antibiotics overnight, and he also recommended Patient A be discharged

with oral anti ‘ics for ten (10) days and a steroid taper. On July 6, 2014, Patient A was
discharged, based on Respondent’s treatment plan, with oral Clindamycin and pain medications.
Steroids were prescribed by Respondent on July 7, 2014. On July 8, 2014, Patient A presented to
St. Rose Siena Hospital Emergency Room with no improvement in his symptoms and with
difficulty opening his mouth. He was admitted after ENT and Infectious Disease (ID) specialist
consultations. Patient A was started on intravenous antibiotics (Vancomycin & Zosyn), pursuant
to the ID doctor’s order. On July 9, 2014, Patient A was evaluated by Respondent, who
recommended that the current treatment of IV antibiotics be continued, but did not recommend
sialogogues (drugs that increase saliva production), which Respondent believed would have
worsened Patient A’s parotitis condition. Respondent recommended to staff that he be informed if|
Patient A’s condition declined.

5. Respondent did not follow-up or further examine Patient A’s parotid condition
from July 9, 2014 through July 14, 2014, and did not perform any consultations relating to
Patient’s medical condition.

6. On July 14, 2014, Patient A received another CT scan due to a lack of]
improvement and worsening symptoms. This CT scan indicated “wall thickening, rim enhancing
collection occupying the parotid, spacing measuring 3 x 2.3 cm as well as calcifications within the
parotid gland consistent with an abscess.” Respondent evaluated Patient A and reviewed the CT
scan with a Radiologist. Respondent’s recommendation was to continue IV antibiotics and
determined that Patient A’s condition was not an abscess.

7. Again, Respondent did not follow-up or further examine Patient A’s parotid
condition from July 15, 2014 through July 18, 2014 and did not conduct any consultations relating
to Patient’s medical condition.

8. On July 18, 2014, another CT scan was conducted because of Patient A’s condition
with worsening symptoms. This CT scan stated “increase in right parotid hypodensity,”
measuring 3.6 x 4.6 centimeters compared to the July 9, 2014 CT scan, which measured 2 x 2.7
centimeters. The diagnosis was an abscess with a compression of the jugular vein or thrombosis
and some airway compromise.

9. On July 19, 2014, Respondent was contacted by the staff at 4:00 am., with
information that Patient A was experiencing increased difficulty breathing and providing the
results of the CT scan performed on July 18, 2014. Respondent did not see Patient A after the
information was conveyed to him. Four (4) hours later, at 8:00 a.m., Respondent called the staft|
nurse and instructed her to place Patient A on an NPO diet (no food or liquids), with plans to later
take Patient A to the operating room to drain the previously non-diagnosed abscess. At 8:10 am.,
a nurse informed Respondent that Patient A was experiencing respiratory distress. Respondent
recommended the nurse call the code team. Patient A coded for approximately ninety (90)
minutes and several unsuccessful attempts were made to secure a clear airway; ultimately an
emergent airway was placed.

COUNTI
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) (Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation)

10. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

11. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

12, NAC 630.210 requires a physician to seek consultation with another provider of|
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.

13, Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition of a parotid gland infection, Respondent further failed to have consulted with an
appropriate care provider to address the doubtfulness of his diagnosis of non-abscess swollen

parotid gland and such a consultation would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis during the

and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds

whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

provided in NRS 630.352.
