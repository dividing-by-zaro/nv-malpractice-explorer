In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 21-34045-1

Against: FILED

KATRINA NIKOLE HASLETT, M.D., NOV 01 2021
Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
By: )
COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through BRANDEE MOONEYHAN, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney
for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that KATRINA NIKOLE HASLETT, M.D.,
(Respondent) violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada
Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues
its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 12811). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 11, 2008, and specializes in obstetrics and gynecology.

2. Patient A* was a twenty-nine (29) year-old female when she first presented to
Respondent on March 28, 2013, to establish prenatal care.

3. On April 4, 2013, Patient A had a follow-up appointment at which Respondent
performed a Pap test. Respondent sent the resulting specimen to a lab for screening.

4. On April 11, 2013, the lab reported to Respondent that Patient A’s specimen

indicated “low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion” (LGSIL).

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D., Chair,

Victor M. Muro, M.D., and Ms. April Mastroluca.
2 Patient A’s name is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but is disclosed in the Patient

Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with a copy of this Complaint.

= The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology recommends that a
pregnant woman with a diagnosis of LGSIL receive a colposcopy, and notes that in such a
circumstance it is acceptable to defer a colposcopy to approximately six (6) weeks postpartum.

6. Respondent did not list the LGSIL results or need for colposcopy on Patient A’s
chart.

7. Respondent eventually delivered Patient A’s baby by Caesarean delivery on
November 4, 2013. Between learning of Patient A’s Pap test results on April 11, 2013, and
delivering her baby on November 4, 2013, Respondent saw Patient A in her medical office ten
(10) times. Respondent’s records do not reflect that she ever notified Patient A that her Pap test
results were abnormal or that she needed a colposcopy after her baby was born.

8. On or about November 21, 2013, Patient A visited Respondent for a post-operative
check of the incision made during the Caesarean delivery. At this visit, Respondent did not
inform Patient A that her Pap test results were abnormal or that she needed a colposcopy in
approximately four (4) weeks. Respondent did not document the November 21, 2013, visit in
Patient A’s medical record.

9. Patient A was scheduled for an additional follow-up visit with Respondent on
December 17, 2013, however, Patient A canceled the appointment the day before. Respondent
made no attempt to reschedule the visit or inform Patient A that her Pap test had been abnormal or
that she needed a colposcopy as soon as possible.

10. Respondent next saw Patient A in her office on October 9, 2014, to address
Patient A’s complaints of irregular vaginal bleeding. Contrary to this being the reason for
Patient A’s visit, Respondent’s record of the visit stated that the patient
“denie[d] ... metrorrhagia.” Respondent still did not inform Patient A that her Pap test in
April 2013 indicated a diagnosis of LGSIL, nor did she perform another Pap test on Patient A.

11. Respondent saw Patient A on October 20, 2014, “for evaluation of
menometrorrhagia”; Respondent noted that she reviewed Patient A’s blood test results with her,
which were normal, and they were “now awaiting [ultrasound appointment].”

12. On October 30, 2014, a pelvic ultrasound was performed on Patient A pursuant to
Respondent’s orders. The resulting medical imaging report showed that Patient A’s cervix had a
hyperechoic mass with blood flow, and the radiologist’s differential diagnosis included “cervical
polyp or cervical fibroid, however, cervical malignancy cannot be excluded.”

13. On November 4, 2014, Respondent saw Patient A to follow up on the results of the
ultrasound. Respondent still did not inform Patient A that her Pap test in April 2013 indicated a
diagnosis of LGSIL, nor did she perform another Pap test.

14. Respondent’s records do not reflect a treatment plan to address Patient A’s
irregular vaginal bleeding, but at some point after the October 30, 2014, ultrasound, Respondent
determined to perform a dilation and curettage procedure (D&C) and hysteroscopy.

15. On December 22, 2014, Patient A visited Respondent for a preoperative
consultation for the upcoming D&C/hysteroscopy. The record of this visit does not reflect that
Respondent performed a pelvic exam, nor does it reflect a treatment plan.

16. On January 14, 2015, Respondent undertook to perform the planned D&C and
hysteroscopy on Patient A but “upon visualization of the cervix, the cervix appeared large and
friable with a somewhat posterior mass.” According to her operative notes, Respondent decided
to perform a biopsy.

17. The subsequent surgical pathology report revealed that Patient A had “invasive
keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma with stromal invasion.” Respondent referred Patient A to a
gynecologist-oncologist, but Patient A asked to be referred to the Mayo Clinic.

18. | On or about February 13, 2015, Patient A was diagnosed with stage IIB squamous
cell carcinoma of the cervix with positive lymph node involvement.

19. Respondent’s records do not document that Respondent ever discussed with
Patient A that her April 2013 Pap test showed a diagnosis of LGSIL.

20. Patient A’s diagnosis of LGSIL required that a colposcopy be performed
approximately six (6) weeks postpartum. Respondent failed to inform Patient A of the necessity
and importance of a colposcopy, failed to schedule such a procedure, and failed to follow up with

Patient A when she canceled her second postpartum appointment. Even when Patient A returned

for care for irregular bleeding approximately ten (10) months after her previous visit, Respondent
did not inform her of her LGSIL diagnosis or perform another Pap test.

21. Respondent’s failure to properly follow up on Patient A’s LGSIL diagnosis
resulted in Patient A’s diagnosis and treatment for cervical cancer being significantly delayed.

22. On or about January 4, 2016, a complaint for medical malpractice in which
Respondent was named as a defendant was filed in a state district court. Respondent was timely
served with the complaint and filed a timely answer thereto.

23. On her 2017 application for biennial renewal of her medical license, Respondent
falsely answered “no” to Question Four, which asked whether during the period of July 1, 2015,
through June 30, 2017, she had been “named as a defendant, or been requested to respond as a
defendant, to a legal action involving professional liability [or] malpractice, including any military
tort claims if applicable.”

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

24. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

25. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

26. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

27. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A when she failed to make sufficient efforts to ensure that
Patient A had a timely postpartum colposcopy.

28. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

31. | Respondent failed to maintain accurate and complete medical records relating to
the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A when she failed to list the results of Patient A’s Pap
test and need for postpartum colposcopy in the patient’s chart; failed to document that she ever
informed Patient A of the Pap test results and need for postpartum colposcopy; made
contradictory statements in her medical records; failed to document treatment plans; and failed to
document at least one interaction at all.

32. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

obtain, maintain or renew a license to practice medicine by bribery, fraud or misrepresentation or
by any false, misleading, inaccurate or incomplete statement constitutes grounds for initiating
disciplinary action.

35. In her 2017 application to renew her medical license, Respondent falsely answered
“N” or “no” to a question asking whether she had been “named as a defendant . . . to a legal action
involving professional liability [or] malpractice’? from July 1, 2105, through
June 30, 2017, when she had been named as a defendant in such a legal action in January 2016.
