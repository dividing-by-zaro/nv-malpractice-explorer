was mailed via USPS Certified Mail, postage pre-paid, to Respondent’s address of record, and
was delivered to and signed for on August 21, 2021, at 12:09 p.m. On September 2, 2021, a
telephonic Early Case Conference was conducted in this matter. Aaron Bart Fricke, J.D., General

with Hearing Officer Patricia Halstead, Esq. Respondent did not appear or participate. The

The Pre-Hearing Conference was held telephonically as noticed and ordered, at which
time, legal counsel for the IC, Mr. Fricke, appeared. Neither the Respondent nor any
representative of the Respondent appeared at the Pre-Hearing Conference. Respondent was timely
and properly served with the Pre-Hearing Conference Statement and the mandated Pre-Hearing
Disclosures in accordance with NRS and NAC Chapters 630, NRS Chapters 241, 622A and 233B,
and the requirements of due process, by Fed Ex Priority Mail, delivered to Respondent at her
address of record on September 22, 2021, at 11:43 a.m.

IV.

On October 19, 2021, as duly noticed and ordered, a hearing was held before the Hearing
Officer to receive evidence and to hear the arguments of both parties. Legal counsel for the IC,
Mr. Fricke, appeared. Respondent did not attend the hearing, nor did she have counsel appear on
her behalf. Mr. Fricke presented the IC’s case, offered documentary evidence and presented
witness testimony. Exhibits 1 through 58, were marked and admitted into evidence.

Pursuant to NRS 622A.350(1) and (2), as Respondent did not appear and as a continuance
had not been scheduled, sought or granted, Mr. Fricke made an offer of proof on the record that
Respondent was given sufficient legal notice. Upon a determination by the regulatory body or
hearing panel or officer that the absent party was given sufficient legal notice, the regulatory body
or hearing panel or officer may proceed to consider and dispose of the case without the
participation of the absent party. Based thereon, good cause appearing, the Hearing Officer found
that sufficient legal notice had been provided to the Respondent, and therefore found that the
Board may accept the IC’s allegations against the Respondent in the Complaint as true.

Notwithstanding the presumption afforded the Board pursuant to NRS 622A.350(2),
Mr. Fricke presented the IC’s case in its entirety, thus establishing a record for the Board to
review the case on the merits.

The Hearing Officer provided the Findings and Recommendations, filed
November 17, 2021. This matter was scheduled for final adjudication on December 3, 2021, at a
regularly scheduled Board meeting.

Iv.

The Board finds that, pursuant to NRS 622.400, recovery from Respondent of reasonable
attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigation and disciplinary
proceedings against Respondent is appropriate. The Board has reviewed the Investigative
Committee’s Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements and Attorneys’ Fees, and the Board finds
them to be the actual fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigative,
administrative and disciplinary proceedings against Respondent, and finds them to be reasonable
and necessary based on: (1) the abilities, training, education, experience, professional standing
and skill demonstrated by Board staff and attorneys; (2) the character of the work done, its
difficulty, its intricacy, its importance, the time and skill required, the responsibility imposed and
the prominence and character of the parties where, as in this case, they affected the importance of

the litigation; (3) the work actually performed by the Board’s attorneys and staff, and the skill,

time and attention given to that work; and (4) the product of the work and benefits to the Board
and the people of Nevada that were derived therefrom.
V.

If any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law is more properly deemed a Finding of Fact, it
may be so construed.

appearing therefore,

This matter came for evidentiary hearing on October 19, 2021. Appearing for the hearing

were Aaron B. Fricke, Esq. on behalf of the Investigative Committee (the “IC”) and the
undersigned Hearing Officer. Respondent Tammy Lynn Hankins, PA-C (“Respondent”) did not
appear nor otherwise participate.

Notice to Respondent of the date and time of the hearing was confirmed on the record.
The hearing record does not reflect proof of service of the Scheduling Order, which initially set
the evidentiary hearing date and time;' however, an Amended Scheduling Order was issued and

filed on September 20, 2021, noticing the evidentiary hearing. A Proof of Service filed on

‘A Proof of Service for the Scheduling Order was filed subsequent to the evidentiary hearing on November 10, 2021,
which indicates that the Scheduling Order, which set the evidentiary hearing date and time, was delivered to
Respondent by certified mail on September 14, 2021 to her last known address.


> Ww Nv


September 24, 2021, indicates that the Amended Scheduling Order was served upon Respondent
by certified mail to her last known address on file with the Nevada State Board of Medical
Examiners (the “Board”) on September 21, 2021. See NRS 630.254; NRS 630.255; NRS
630.344; and Volume 1, Exhibit 15. Thus, Respondent had notice of the evidentiary hearing.

Prior filings were also sent to Respondent by which she had notice of the proceedings such
as the Complaint and Errata thereto, proofs of service for which are reflected in the record at
Volume 1, Exhibits 4 and 5 respectively; the First Amended Complaint and Order for Summary
Suspension, proof of service for which are reflected at Volume 1, Exhibit 8; and the Order
Scheduling Early Case Conference, proof of service for which is reflected at Volume 1, Exhibit
10. Despite the filings served upon Respondent, she has failed to make any appearance in this
matter.

With Respondent having failed to appear and no continuance having been requested nor

granted, the matter was heard as scheduled pursuant to NRS 622A.350, which provides:

1, If a party fails to appear at a scheduled hearing and a continuance
has not been scheduled or granted, any party who is present at the hearing may
make an offer of proof that the absent party was given sufficient legal notice. Upon
a determination by the regulatory body or hearing panel or officer that the absent
party was given sufficient legal notice, the regulatory body or hearing panel or
officer may proceed to consider and dispose of the case without the participation of
the absent party.

2. Ifthe licensee fails to appear at a hearing, the regulatory body or
hearing panel or officer may accept the allegations against the licensee in the
charging document as true.

As well as pursuant to NAC 630.470(2), which provides: “If a licensee fails to appear at a
scheduled hearing and no continuance has been requested and granted, the evidence may be heard
and the matter may be considered and disposed of on the basis of the evidence before the Board,
panel or hearing officer in the manner required by this section.”

In so proceeding, Mr. Fricke asked that the matter be considered from the record, which
includes the transcript of the September 20, 2021 Summary Suspension Hearing (Volume 1,

Exhibit 19) and all exhibits submitted and admitted in support thereof (Volume 2, Exhibits 1-58),


a

a a

which were incorporated by reference into the record of the evidentiary hearing for purposes of its
adjudication. Mr. Fricke then provided a closing statement, gave direction on the organization of
the Amended Complaint and the exhibits, and submitted the matter for consideration.

Having heard from Mr. Fricke regarding the circumstances underlying the initial
suspension of Respondent’s license and the continued basis therefore; having considered the same
in consideration of the charges against Respondent; and there being no contradictory evidence
presented in either proceeding, the undersigned Hearing Officer finds as follows.

1. Respondent has prior felony convictions out of the State of Arizona for Conspiracy
to Obtain a Dangerous Drug by Fraud, a Class B felony (conviction date is October 2, 2013), and
Sexual Conduct with a Minor, a Class 6 felony (conviction date is August 11, 2014). Volume 2,
Exhibits 17-19. Respondent was granted the privilege of probation for the Conspiracy to Obtain a
Dangerous Drug by Fraud conviction, which was revoked based upon the violation of her
probation and the subsequent Sexual Conduct with a Minor conviction. Id.

2. Subsequent to her incarceration for the Arizona felony convictions, perhaps in
early October 2019, although it is not clear, Respondent began employment with Vida Spa LLC, a
Nevada Limited Liability Company (“Vida Spa”).

3. On March 6, 2020, Respondent appeared before the Board in support of her then
submitted application to obtain licensure to practice as a physician’s assistant in the State of
Nevada. Respondent represented to the Board that her employment with Vida Spa was contingent
upon her licensing and that she had not practiced clinical medicine since 2013. Volume II,
Exhibit 20, pg. 318.

4. Respondent was granted Nevada license on Mach 6, 2020.

5. On October 6, 2020, the Board received a complaint against Respondent regarding
patient care and bodily injury in relation to a medical procedure that Respondent performed on
June 27, 2020. Volume 1, Exhibit 19, p. 16; Volume II, Exhibit 30.

6. The IC investigated the lodged complaint and, in so doing, requested a response

from Respondent to several allegations of wrongdoing. No response by Respondent was


Ce eon NWN

forthcoming and a subpoena duces tecum was eventually issued to Vida Spa. Volume II, Exhibits
30-37.

7. Records obtained from Vida Spa in the course of the IC’s investigation against
Respondent demonstrate that Respondent had been practicing medicine at Vida Spa since at least
October 2019, six (6) months prior to her appearance before the Board referenced in paragraph 3
above.

8. The records obtained in the course of the IC’s investigation demonstrate that
Respondent performed liposuction, a medical procedure, for Patient A on October 10, 2019;
Patient B on October 8, 2019; Patient C on October 9, 2019; Patent D on October 13, 2019;
Patient E on October 8, 2019; Patient I on June 2, 2020; Patient J on June 3, 2020; Patient K on
June 4, 2020; and Patient L on June 5, 2020. In addition, Respondent performed medical
procedures by undertaking Botox and Versa injections for Patient F on August 14, 2019; Xeomin
and Versa injections for Patient G on October 29, 2019; and Versa injections for Patient H on
November 5, 2019. Volume II, Exhibits 1 through 13, and 38-58; Volume II, Exhibit 19.

9. While undertaking each of the above-referenced medical procedures, Respondent
was not working under a supervising physician. Volume I, Exhibit 19, pp. 36, 49-51, 53; Volume
II, Exhibits 25, 26, and 30; see NRS 630.271.

10. The above-referenced medical procedures were performed in a facility that was not
a medical facility nor otherwise permitted so as to legally accommodate the administration of
anesthesia or sedation. Volume I, Exhibit 19, p. 73; see NRS 449.0151; NRS 630.373.

11. In undertaking the treatment of Patients A through E and I through L, Respondent,
who was not a licensed prescribing practitioner in that she was not licensed at the time nor under
the supervision of a prescribing physician (see NRS 453.126), prescribed controlled substances,
namely Tramadol; Diazepam; Alprazolam; and/or Oxycodone. Volume II, Exhibits | through 5, 9
through 13; Volume II, Exhibit 19, pp. 51-54, 59-65, 68.

12. Respondent performed invasive medical procedures, namely liposuction and/or fat
grafting on Patients A through E and I through L, without proper sedation and in a manner

dangerous to patient care and safety, utilizing a tumescent anesthesia with Lidocaine and


ot

Epinephrine or other controlled substances from Vida Spa’s general storage of controlled
substances, which were obtained by Respondent without a patient-specific prescription or an order
from a licensed prescribing and supervising practitioner, and which Respondent utilized to
facilitate conscious sedation. Volume II, Exhibits 1 through 5, 9 through 13; Volume II, Exhibit
19, pp. 59-70.

WHEREFORE, the undersigned hearing officer finds as follows:

Proper notice of the proceedings, inclusive of the evidentiary hearing, was provided to
Respondent and no continuance of the evidentiary hearing was sought nor granted;

Pursuant to NRS 622A.350(2) the undersigned accepts the allegations against Respondent
in the First Amended Complaint, filed June 20, 2021, as true;

Aside from the authority granted by NRS 622A.350(2), the undersigned hearing officer
finds that the IC established violations of Counts I; V; IX; XIII; XVII; XXIII; XXVIII; and
XXXII, Unlicensed Practice of Medicine, in that Respondent undertook the medical procedures
outlined in paragraph 8 herein prior to obtaining her Nevada license.

The undersigned hearing officer finds that the IC established violations of Counts II; VI;
X; XIV; XVII; XXIV; XXIX; XXXII; XXXVII; XLI; XLV; and XLIX, Malpractice, in that
Respondent failed use reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances by similarly trained and experienced providers of health care in treating Patients A
through L by undertaking medical procedures without being properly licensed; by undertaking
medical procedures without required supervision; by undertaking invasive medical procedures in
an unpermitted and non-medical facility; by fraudulently prescribing and/or improperly
administering controlled substances; and/or by utilizing controlled substances in a manner that
deviated from standard practice for the procedures undertaken.

The undersigned hearing officer finds that the IC established violations of Counts III; VII;
XI; XV; and XIX, Fraudulent, Illegal, Unauthorized and Otherwise Inappropriate Prescribing of
Schedule IV Controlled Substances, in that Respondent prescribed Tramadol and/or Diazepam,
each of which are controlled substances, to Patients A, B, C, D, and E, and did so without the

involvement and supervision of a licensed prescribing practitioner and by utilizing the



oclUlUCmUlUlUMCOUC UMN

prescription credentials of a licensed prescribing practitioner who had not seen nor treated the
patients to which the controlled substances were prescribed.

The undersigned hearing officer finds that the IC established violations of Counts IV;
VIU; XI; XVI; XX; XXV; XXX; XXXIV; XXXIX; XLII; XLVI; and LI, Disreputable
Conduct, in that Respondent engaged in conduct that brings the medical profession into disrepute
by and through unethical conduct that includes having practiced medicine without a license;
engaging in the unsupervised practice of medicine; having performed invasive medical procedures
in an unpermitted and non-medical facility; having fraudulently prescribed controlled substances;
and/or having accessed and misused controlled substance(s) to invoke conscious sedation for
liposuction procedures in relation to the treatment of patients A through L.

The undersigned hearing officer finds that the IC established violations of Counts XXI,
XXII; XXVI; XXVHI; and XXXI, Illegal Injection, in that Respondent injected Patients F and G
with Botox/Xeomin, a neuromodulator derived from clostridium botulinum, and injected Patients
F, G, and H with Versa, a dermal or soft tissue filler, without being licensed to practice medicine
at the time of the injections and did so in an unpermitted and non-medical facility.

The undersigned hearing officer finds that the IC established a violation of Count XXXV,
Fraud and Misrepresentation in Obtaining a License, in that Respondent appeared before the
Board on March 6, 2020, and knowingly and falsely represented that she had not practiced clinical
medicine since 2013 and that her job at a Las Vegas medical spa, i.e., Vida Spa, was contingent
upon her obtaining a license to practice in Nevada. This representation by Respondent was false
and was made in an attempt to obtain her Nevada medical license. Respondent had been
employed by and practicing medicine at Vida Spa since at least October 2019.

The undersigned hearing officer finds that the IC established violations of Counts XXXVI;
XL; XLIV; and XLVIII, Performing Medical Services Without a Supervising Physician, in that
Respondent performed liposuction and/or fat grafting procedures for Patients I, J, K, and L
without supervision by a licensed physician.
