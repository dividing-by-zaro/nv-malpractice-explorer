By: a

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT
The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(Board), by and through Robert Kilroy, Esq., General Counsel and attomey for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Syed F. Rahman, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its First Amended Complaint (Complaint),
stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10030). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on November 17, 2001.

2. On June 18, 2015, Patient A? was transferred from Sunrise Hospital (Sunrise) to
AMG Specialty Hospital (AMG) for long-term acute care, including, but not limited to, ongoing
management of ventilator-dependent respiratory failure with associated encephalopathy.
Respondent was the attending physician for Patient A, who was receiving all nourishment and
non-intravenous medication through a gastric feeding tube (PEG tube), which was administered at

Sunrise.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chairman, Mr. M.
Neil Duxbury, and Aury Nagy, M.D.

2 Patient A's true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this First Amended Complaint

3. On July 5, 2015, Patient A’s PEG tube was displaced, and an attempt was made to
replace the PEG tube with a Foley catheter placed into the site from which this PEG tube had been
displaced. Tube feedings were discontinued, as Respondent ordered a Total Parental Nutrition (TPN),
and a gastroenterology (GI) consult. Patient A’s blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 24 and the Creatinine
(Cx) was at 0.94, and that ratio (BUN/CR) reflects adequate hydration and proper renal function.

4. On July 9, 2015, the GI consultant ordered to continue to hold all tube feedings, and
continue with the previously ordered TPN. This TPN was the sole source of nutrition and hydration|
for Patient A.

5. Under Respondent's care from July 10, 2015 through July 18, 2015, Patient suffered
from worsening dehydration and renal function:.

a. On July 10, 2015, Patient A’s BUN was 39, and the Cr was 0.89, indicating
less hydration; On July 12, 2015, the BUN was 45, and the Cr was 0.87, indicating
inadequate hydration; On July 14, 2015, the BUN was 53, and the Cr was 1.03, indicating
worsening hydration and renal degradation in function; On July 15, 2015, Patient’s PEG
tube malfunctioned; Gastroenterology was consulted and Patient was placed on a NPO and
the IV TPN was implemented; On July 16, 2015, the BUN was 66, and the Cr was 1.21;
On July 17, 2015, the BUN was 86, and the Cr was 1.57, indicating worsening renal
function or failure due to the rising BUN/Cr ratio of greater than 50. CT Scan of Patient
A’s abdomen indicated the gastrostomy tube was not in the stomach. This tube was!
located outside the stomach between the interior pole of the liver and the superior wall of
the distal stomach.

6. On July 18, 2015, Patient A was transferred back to Sunrise. Patient A’s BUN was
105 and the Cr was 2.19. Respondent's transfer note incorrectly states “On 7/18/2015, he had a PEG
malfunction. Foley catheter was placed. However, it shows that the Foley catheter to be in the place in
the right position.” Respondent's cited date of “7/18/2015” is incorrect as this CT Scan occurred
earlier as the aforementioned date is the date of Patient’s transfer.

7. Under Respondent’s care, Patient A’s renal function worsened, suffered from

malnutrition and dehydration as evidence by the rising BUN/Creatinine Ratio of 25 on July 5, 2015;

to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

12. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he provided medical services to Patient A based upon his inadequate management and resolution
of the PEG tube, his inadequate management of worsening renal failure as indicated by the rising,
BUNICr Ratio from July 10, 2015 through July 18, 2015, which was the day Patient A was
transferred from Respondent's care and returned back to Sunrise.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

20. | NAC 630.210 requires a physician to seek consultation with another provider of |
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.

21. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition of dehydration and of renal failure, and Respondent should have consulted with an
appropriate care provider to address the aforementioned worsening conditions, and such a
consultation could have enhanced Patient A’s declining medical condition of renal failure and
dehydration.

22. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:
