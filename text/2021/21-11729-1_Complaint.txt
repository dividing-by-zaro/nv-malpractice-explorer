COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Aaron B. Fricke, Esq., General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Crispino Santos, M.D., (Respondent) violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and
allegations as follows:

l. Respondent was at all times relevant to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 8198). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on June 9, 1997.

2. Patient A? was a healthy, thirty (30) year-old female of normal height and weight at
the time of the events at issue.

3. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Respondent maintained a medical office at
Interventional Pain Medicine, 7190 Smoke Ranch Road, Suite 150, Las Vegas, NV 89128 (IPM).

4. IPM was at all times relevant to this Complaint an “office of a physician or a

facility that provides health care, other than a medical facility.” Neither Respondent nor IPM held

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Chair, Aury Nagy, M.D.,
and Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.).

? Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

the requisite permit issued by the Nevada State Board of Health, pursuant to NRS 449.442, to
provide “conscious sedation” at IPM. Further, neither IPM nor Respondent held a current
accreditation by a nationally recognized organization approved by the Nevada State Board of
Health.

5. On or about November 17, 2015, Patient A presented to Respondent for an initial
evaluation for breast augmentation. Respondent diagnosed Patient A with hypoplasia of the
breast. No description or measurement of Patient A’s breasts nor a breast examination are
documented in Respondent’s medical records.

6. On or about November 17, 2015, Patient A agreed to have an augmentation
mastopexy, with submuscular saline implants. Respondent’s medical records indicate that
Respondent described the procedure, consent, pre-op and post-op care to Patient A, and the plan to
proceed with bilateral breast augmentation in February, however, no specific discussion of a
surgical plan, the correction of deformities, or breast exam are documented in Respondent’s
medical records.

7. Respondent did not discuss with Patient A, on November 17, 2015, the method of
anesthesia planned to be used for the operation. Patient A reasonably assumed that the surgery
would be done under general anesthesia or deep sedation in a properly permitted and accredited
surgical facility approved by the Nevada State Board of Health pursuant to NRS 449.442.

8. On February 9, 2016, Patient A presented to Respondent at IPM for a preoperative
evaluation. The only physical exam related to Patient A’s breasts that Respondent documented
was the exam of axillary lymph nodes; no examination of the breast for masses, size,
measurements of nipple position or breast width, no surgical plan, discussion of incision, breast
implant pocket or placement are documented. At this visit, Respondent scheduled the breast
augmentation procedure for the morning of February 25, 2016.

9. Respondent still had not discussed with Patient A on February 9, 2016, or
previously, the method and type of anesthesia to be used for the operation. Patient A still

reasonably assumed that the surgery would be done under general anesthesia or deep sedation in a

WY ND



properly permitted and accredited surgical facility approved by the Nevada State Board of Health
pursuant to NRS 449.442.

10. On February 9, 2016, at this preoperative evaluation, Respondent provided
hand-written prescriptions to Patient A as follows: Diazepam 10 mg tablet, 6 ct., for six (6) days
supply; Hydrocodone-acetaminophen 10-325 mg tablet, 42 ct. for a fourteen (14) day supply,
which constitutes a milligram morphine equivalent (MME) of 30 mg per day; Ciprofloxacin
250 mg, 28 ct., twice per day for fourteen (14) days. Respondent instructed Patient A to begin
taking the prescribed Ciprofloxacin on February 19, 2016.

11. | Respondent did not document in his medical record of February 9, 2016, any
justification for prescribing 30 MME per day of opioid analgesics to a healthy thirty (30) year-old
female of normal height and weight.

12. Respondent instructed Patient A to take Schedule IV controlled substances that he
prescribed in a manner that materially deviated from the written prescriptions; Respondent
instructed Patient A to take two (2) Diazepam and at least one (1) Hydrocodone-acetaminophen
upon arrival at IPM for surgery. Respondent did not document the prescriptions or the reasons for
the Diazepam or Hydrocodone-acetaminophen, nor did he document his instructions that
contravened the written prescriptions anywhere in his medical records.

13. On February 9, 2016, Respondent instructed Patient A to deviate from the written
prescriptions and take Diazepam and Hydrocodone-acetaminophen for the purpose of conscious
sedation for the invasive, surgical procedure he planned to perform on Patient A.

14. Patient A took the prescribed medications as instructed, two (2) 10 mg Diazepam
tablets and at least one (1) Hydrocodone-acetaminophen tablet, upon arrival at IPM for surgery on
February 25, 2016. Respondent noted in Patient A’s medical records that the medications were
taken as instructed.

15. | Respondent did not inform Patient A at any time at or before she presented to
Respondent at IPM on February 25, 2016, that she would not receive general anesthesia or deep
sedation prior to the commencement of the surgery on February 25, 2016. Additionally,

Respondent did not inform Patient A that IPM was a facility that was not properly permitted and

(775) 688-2559



accredited by the Nevada State Board of Health pursuant to NRS 449.442, and did not obtain
consent from Patient A for the performance of the procedure in the unpermitted and unaccredited
facility.

16. | Upon arrival at IPM, after having taken two (2) Diazepam 10 mg tablets, and at
least one (1) Hydrocodone-acetaminophen 10-325 mg tablet, Respondent informed Patient A that
the surgery would not be done under general anesthesia or deep sedation.

17. On February 25, 2016, Respondent attempted to perform an “Awake Breast
Augmentation with Tumescent Anesthesia” (First Surgery), that is, Respondent attempted to
perform a surgical operation to insert breast implants into Patient A’s subpectoral muscle space
under tumescent local anesthesia at the surgical site, and while Patient A was consciously sedated
with a combination of Diazepam and Hydrocodone-acetaminophen.

18. | Respondent commenced the First Surgery at approximately 8:55 a.m., and
concluded at approximately 11:00 a.m., during which time only 10 cc of 1% Lidocaine was used
for the entire procedure.

19. During the First Surgery, Respondent placed the left breast implant in a superior

malposition in a sub-muscular pocket, and the right breast implant subglandular and prepectoral.

20. Patient A did not receive intravenous sedation and was awake throughout the First
Surgery.
21. Patient A felt pain throughout the procedure, consciously experienced Respondent

cutting open her breast skin and tissue, inserting surgical instruments and implants into her body,
removing tissue from her body, stitching of her skin, and other traumas, for over two (2) hours.

22. Patient A was substantially traumatized, physically and psychologically, by the
First Surgery performed by Respondent.

23. On February 25, 2016, Respondent provided a hand-written prescription to Patient
A as follows: Oxycodone-acetaminophen 10-325 mg tablet, 60 ct. for thirty (30) days supply,
which constitutes thirty (30) MME per day.

24. On March 1, 2016, Patient A presented to Respondent at IPM for a “post-operative

visit.” Respondent’s record of his physical exam does not describe anything with respect to


Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
9600 Gateway Drive
Reno, Nevada 89521
(775) 688-2559

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


Patient A’s breasts, implant position, erythema, or sensibility of nipple areolar position.
Respondent did not document the presence or absence of seroma, hematoma, implant position,
sensibility of nipples or wound appearance, except that Respondent noted a “blister” over the right
breast, for which Respondent applied antibiotic ointment.

25. | On March 3, 2016, Patient A presented to Respondent at IPM for another “post-
operative visit.” Again, Respondent’s records reflect no relevant physical examination or findings
of any kind.

26. On March 3, 2016, Respondent provided a hand-written prescription to Patient A
as follows: Oxycodone-acetaminophen 10-325 mg tablet, 120 ct. for thirty (30) days supply,
which alone amounts to sixty (60) MME per day, but combined with the thirty-day prescription
for Oxycodone-acetaminophen that Respondent wrote on February 25, 2021, just eight (8) days
prior, amounts to ninety (90) MME per day, and constitutes high-dose opioid therapy. If the
Oxycodone-acetaminophen were taken as directed, Patient A would have had more than one
hundred sixty (160) tablets of Oxycodone-acetaminophen at this time.

27. Respondent did not document in his medical record of March 3, 2016, any
explanation or justification for prescribing an additional sixty (60) MME per day or the combined
ninety (90) MME per day of opioid analgesics to a healthy thirty-year-old female of normal height
and weight.

28. Respondent prescribed to Patient A ninety (90) MME per day without establishing
the medical necessity of high-dose opioid therapy.

29. On March 7, 2016, Patient A presented to Respondent at IPM for another “post-
operative visit.” Again, Respondent’s records reflect no relevant physical examination or findings
of any kind.

30. On March 22, 2016, Patient A presented to Respondent at IPM for another “post-
operative visit.” Again, Respondent’s records reflect no relevant physical examination or findings
of any kind, do not describe breast appearance, operative site, etc. The only notation Respondent
made in reference to the First Surgery was, “The patient is doing well. Surgical site has healed.

No signs of infection.”

31. On March 22, 2016, Respondent provided hand-written prescriptions to Patient A
as follows: Diazepam 5 mg tablet, 5 ct., for 5 days supply; Oxycodone-acetaminophen 10-325 mg
tablet, 120 ct. for a thirty (30) day supply, which alone amounts to sixty (60) MME per day, but
combined with the thirty (30) day prescription for Oxycodone-acetaminophen that Respondent
wrote on March 3, 2021, just eighteen (18) days prior, amounts to one hundred twenty (120)
MME per day, which is high-dose opioid therapy and an unsafe dosage.

32. | Respondent did not document in his medical record of March 22, 2016, any
explanation or justification for prescribing either sixty (60) MME per day or one hundred twenty
(120) MME per day of opioid analgesics to a healthy thirty (30) year-old female of normal height
and weight.

33. | Respondent prescribed to Patient A one hundred twenty (120) MME per day
without establishing the medical necessity of high-dose opioid therapy.

34. | On March 30, 2016, Respondent attempted to perform a “Left Breast Revision of


saline implants,” as stated in his records (Second Surgery), that is, Respondent attempted to
perform a surgical operation to insert breast implants into Patient A’s subpectoral muscle space
under tumescent local anesthesia at the surgical site, and while Patient A was, again, consciously
sedated with a combination of Diazepam and Hydrocodone-acetaminophen.

35. On March 30, 2016, at IPM, Respondent performed the Second Surgery for,
apparently, a revision of Patient A’s left breast, again, under local anesthesia with 75 cc of
1% Lidocaine. The Second Surgery took place at IPM from 3:05 p.m. to 4:35 p.m., during which
time Patient A’s blood pressure was taken only twice.

36. During the Second Surgery, Respondent did not correct for the prior misplacement
of the implants from the First Surgery, and did not address any of the cosmetic issues, rather,
Respondent merely exchanged the left breast implant for a larger one in the same position.

37. | On March 30, 2016, Respondent provided a hand-written prescription to Patient A
as follows: Hydromorphone 4 mg tablet, 56 ct. for a fourteen (14) day supply, which alone
constitutes sixty-four (64) MME per day, but combined with the thirty (30) day prescription for

sixty (60) MME per day of Oxycodone-acetaminophen that Respondent wrote on March 3, 2021,


OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

9600 Gateway Drive

Reno, Nevada 89521

(775) 688-2559


just twenty-seven (27) days prior, and combined with the thirty (30) day prescription for sixty (60)
MME of Oxycodone-acetaminophen that Respondent wrote on March 22, 2021, just seven
(7) days prior, amounts to one hundred eighty-four (184) MME per day, which is high-dose opioid
therapy and an unsafe dosage.

38. Respondent did not document in his medical record of March 22, 2016, any
explanation or justification for prescribing either sixty (60) MME, one hundred twenty (120)
MME or one hundred eighty-four (184) MME per day of opioid analgesics to a healthy thirty-
year-old female of normal height and weight.

39. Respondent prescribed to Patient A one hundred eighty-four (184) MME per day of
opioid analgesics without establishing the medical necessity of high-dose opioid therapy.

40. Following the First Surgery and Second Surgery, Patient A was left with a left
implant in a superior malposition in a sub-muscular pocket, sub-glandular right implant
placement, asymmetry of nipple areolar complexes, with the left areolar complex being inferior.
Also, Patient A had some skin dehiscence in the right compared to left mammary crease incisions.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) - Malpractice

41. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

42. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

43. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as “the failure of a physician, in treating a
patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances.”

44. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
rendering medical services to Patient A by, among other failures, 1) failing to properly perform
the surgery he intended by instead placing the left breast implant in a superior malposition in a

sub-muscular pocket in the First Surgery; 2) failing to properly perform the surgery he intended


OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

9600 Gateway Drive

Reno, Nevada 89521

(775) 688-2559


by placing the right breast implant subglandular and prepectoral in the First Surgery, 3) repeating
these errors in the Second Surgery; 4) failing to properly examine for, recognize and document
that the breast implants had been placed in different positions in the chest wall, i.e., one
subpectoral and the other subglandular; 5) repeatedly failing, both pre-operatively and post-
operatively, to perform and document an appropriate examination of the chest, breasts, and
surgical site, sensibility in the nipples, perfusion in the skin, presence or absence of seroma or
hematoma, and the obvious malposition of the implants with respect to each other; and 6)
repeatedly prescribing exceedingly high and unsafe dosages of opioid analgesics without medical
necessity.

45. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT Il
NRS 630.306(1)(0) — Administration of Conscious Sedation at an Unaccredited and
Unpermitted Facility

46. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

47. Pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(0), failure to comply with the requirements of
NRS 630.373 is grounds for initiating discipline or denying licensure.

48. Pursuant to NRS 630.373(1), a physician shall not administer or supervise directly
the administration of general anesthesia, conscious sedation or deep sedation to patients unless the
general anesthesia, conscious sedation or deep sedation is administered: (a) in an office of a
physician or osteopathic physician which holds a permit pursuant to NRS 449.435 to 449.448,
inclusive; (b) in a facility which holds a permit pursuant to NRS 449.435 to 449.448, inclusive;
(c) in a medical facility as that term is defined in NRS 449.0151; or (d) outside of the State of
Nevada.

49. For the purposes of NRS 630.373, “conscious sedation” means a minimally
depressed level of consciousness, produced by a pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic method, or

a combination thereof, in which the patient retains the ability independently and continuously to

maintain an airway and to respond appropriately to physical stimulation and verbal commands.
NRS 449.436.

50. Pursuant to NRS 453.021, “administer” means the direct application of a controlled
substance, whether by injection, inhalation, ingestion or any other means, to the body of a patient
or research subject by: (1) a practitioner or, in the practitioner’s presence, by the practitioner’s
authorized agent; or (2) the patient or research subject at the direction and in the presence of the
practitioner.

51. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent
failed to comply with NRS 630.373 when rendering medical services to Patient A, by, among
other misconduct, issuing prescriptions for controlled substances to Patient A in order to
administer and/or supervise directly the administration of conscious sedation to Patient A for an
invasive surgical procedure that Respondent performed on Patient A at IPM, which is not the
office of a physician or osteopathic physician which holds a permit pursuant to NRS 449.435 to
449.448, inclusive, not a facility which holds a permit pursuant to NRS 449.435 to 449.448,
inclusive, and not a medical facility as that term is defined in NRS 449.0151, and which is located
inside the State of Nevada.

52. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this

case as outlined in NRS 622.400;
