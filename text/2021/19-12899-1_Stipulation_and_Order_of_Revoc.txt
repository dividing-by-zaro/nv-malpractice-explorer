(Board), by and through Aaron Bart Fricke, Esq., Senior Deputy General Counsel for the Board
and attorney for the IC, and Ronald Hope Foote, M.D. (Respondent), a physician with an expired
license to practice medicine in Nevada, assisted by his attorney Daniel H. Stewart, Esq., of the law
firm Hutchison & Steffen, PLLC, hereby enter into this Stipulation and Order of Revocation
(Stipulation) based on the following:!

A. BACKGROUND

1. Respondent is a medical doctor currently licensed in expired status by the Board
pursuant to Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) and Chapter 630 of the Nevada
Administrative Code (NAC) (collectively, the Medical Practice Act). His license was originally
issued on December 4, 1999 (License No. 9240).

2. On September 6, 2019, pursuant to a Settlement Agreement approved and accepted by
the Board, Respondent admitted to all Counts, I through VIII, of the formal Complaint filed in this
Case No. 19-12899-1, as set forth in the Complaint: Count I, violation of NRS 630.301(9)
(Disreputable Conduct); Count II, violation of NRS 630.306(1)(c) (Engaging in Conduct That Violated

1 All agreements and admissions made by Respondent are solely for final disposition of these matters and
any subsequent related administrative proceedings or civil litigation involving the Board and Respondent. Therefore,
Respondent’s agreements and admissions are not intended or made for any other use, such as in the context of another
state or federal government regulatory agency proceeding, state or federal civil or criminal proceeding, any state or
federal court proceeding, or any credentialing or privileges matter.

Pharmacy Board Regulations); Count III, violation of NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) (Violation of
Standards of Practice); Count IV, violation of NRS 630.3062(1)(a) (Failure to Maintain Complete
Medical Records); Count V, violation of NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) (Violation of Standards of
Practice); Count VI, violation of NRS 630.3062(1)(a) (Failure to Maintain Complete Medical
Records); Count VII, violation of NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) (Violation of Standards of Practice);
Count VIII, violation of NRS 630.3062(1)(a) (Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records).
For these admitted violations, the Board ordered that Respondent’s license to practice medicine in
Nevada be revoked, with the revocation immediately stayed and his license placed on probation
for a period of sixty (60) months, subject to various terms and conditions, including but not
limited to the following: (1) he shall reinstate his license, providing all regularly required
documentation and paying all required fees, by June 30, 2020; (2) he shall comply with and
complete all terms and conditions of any criminal sanctions incurred before or during the period of
the Agreement, specifically including but not limited to Eighth Judicial District Court of the State
of Nevada, Case No. C-18-335993-1, including probation or parole, including full compliance
with and successful completion of the all terms of that suspension of sentence and probation
imposed in that case pursuant to NRS 453.3363.

3. As provided in the Settlement Agreement and Order, if Respondent fails to
demonstrate compliance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement within sixty (60) months,
or otherwise violates the terms of the Agreement or the Medical Practice Act, then the IC shall be
authorized to immediately suspend Respondent’s license to practice medicine in Nevada, pending
a duly noticed Order To Show Cause Hearing to take place within sixty (60) days of the
suspension. If the violation of the Agreement or the Medical Practice Act is proved after such
hearing, pursuant to the express terms of the Agreement, the stay of revocation shall be lifted, and
Respondent’s license shall be revoked. In such case, pursuant to NRS 622A.410(1), Respondent
may not apply for reinstatement of his medical license for a period of five (5) years from the date
of the Board’s final order of revocation.

4. On March 26, 2021, in Case No. 19-12899-1, the IC filed a formal Notice of

Violation of Board Order and Order to Show Cause on Revocation of Licensure (Order to Show

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


Cause) charging Respondent with violating the Settlement Agreement and Order. Specifically,
the Order to Show Cause alleges:

a. First Cause of Action for Revocation — Pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement and Order, paragraph 5(b), Respondent agreed and was ordered to reinstate his license,
providing all regularly required documentation and paying all required fees, by June 30, 2020.
Respondent did not reinstate his license by June 30, 2020, had not provided any of the regularly
required documents nor paid any of the required fees, and has not done so as of the date of the
filing of the Order to Show Cause, more than eight (8) months later. Accordingly, pursuant to the
Settlement Agreement and Order, paragraph 5(c), and by reason of the foregoing misconduct of
the Respondent, and in light of Respondent’s repeated failures to comply with the Medical
Practice Act and the orders of the Board throughout the entirety of his licensure by the Board, and
for the protection and benefit of the public, the Board has abundant good cause to lift its stay of
revocation, and thereby revoke Respondent’s license to practice medicine.

b. Second Cause of Action for Revocation — Pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement and Order, paragraph 5(c)(5), Respondent agreed and was ordered to comply with and
complete all terms and conditions of any criminal sanctions incurred before or during the period of
the Agreement, specifically including but not limited to Eighth Judicial District Court of the State
of Nevada, Case No. C-18-335993-1, including probation or parole, including full compliance
with and successful completion of the all terms of that suspension of sentence and probation
imposed in that case pursuant to NRS 453.3363. Respondent violated paragraph S(c)5, of the
Settlement Agreement and Order as specifically alleged in the Order to Show Cause. Pursuant to
paragraph 5(c), and by reason of the foregoing misconduct of the Respondent, and in light of
Respondent’s repeated failures to comply with the Medical Practice Act and the orders of the
Board throughout the entirety of his licensure by the Board, and for the protection and benefit of
the public, the Board has abundant good cause to lift its stay of revocation, and thereby revoke
Respondent’s license to practice medicine.

5. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352, and according to the express conditions of the Settlement Agreement
and Order.

6. Respondent was properly served with a copy of the Order to Show Cause, has
reviewed and understands the Order to Show Cause, and has had the opportunity to consult with
competent counsel concerning the nature and significance of the Order to Show Cause.

7. Respondent is hereby advised of his rights regarding these administrative matters,
and of his opportunity to defend against the allegations in the Order to Show Cause. Specifically,
Respondent has certain rights in these administrative matters as set out by the United States
Constitution, the Nevada Constitution, the Medical Practice Act, the Nevada Open Meeting Law
(OML), which is contained in NRS Chapter 241, and the Nevada Administrative Procedure Act
(APA), which is contained in NRS Chapter 233B. These rights include the right to a formal
hearing on the allegations in the Order to Show Cause, the right to representation by counsel, at
his own expense, in the preparation and presentation of his defense, the right to confront and
cross-examine the witnesses and evidence against him, the right to written findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order reflecting the final decision of the Board, and the right to judicial
review of the Board’s order, if the decision is adverse to him.

8. Respondent understands that, under the Board’s charge to protect the public by
regulating the practice of medicine, the Board may take disciplinary action against Respondent’s
license, including license probation, license suspension, license revocation and imposition of
administrative fines, as well as any other reasonable requirement or limitation, if the Board
concludes that Respondent violated one or more provisions of the Medical Practice Act.

9. Respondent understands and agrees that this Stipulation, by and between
Respondent and the IC, is not with the Board, and that the IC will present this Stipulation to the
Board for consideration in open session at a duly noticed and scheduled meeting. Respondent
understands that the IC shall advocate for the Board’s approval of this Stipulation, but that the
Board has the right to decide in its own discretion whether or not to approve this Stipulation.

4. Acknowledgement of Reasonable Basis to Proceed. Respondent acknowledges

that the IC believes it has a reasonable basis to allege that Respondent engaged in conduct that is
grounds for discipline pursuant to the Medical Practice Act. The IC acknowledges that
Respondent is agreeing to resolve this matter to avoid the costs of hearing and potential
subsequent litigation. Respondent asserts that if these matters were to proceed to hearing, he has

against Respondent, Respondent hereby agrees that the Board may issue an order finding that

Act. Accordingly, the following terms and conditions are hereby agreed upon:

a. Respondent admits to the First Cause of Action for Revocation, violation of
paragraph 5(b) of the Settlement Agreement and Order, as Respondent did not reinstate his license
by June 30, 2020, and did not provide any of the regularly required documents, nor pay any of the
required fees, and had not done so as of the date of the filing of the Order to Show Cause, more
than eight (8) months later.

b. The Second Cause of Action for Revocation shall be dismissed with
prejudice.

c. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and Order, paragraph 5(c), by reason
of the foregoing, and in light of Respondent’s extensive disciplinary history, and for the protection
and benefit of the public, good cause appearing, the Board hereby lifts its stay of revocation, and

NRS 622A.410(1), and hereby specifically amending the Settlement Agrement and Order as
