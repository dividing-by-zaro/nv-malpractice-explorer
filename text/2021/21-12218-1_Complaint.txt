BEFORE THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS
OF THE STATE OF NEVADA


In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 21-12218-1

Against: FI LE D
RAJEEV SHARAD KHAMAMKAR, M.D., OCT 11 2021
Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

MEDICAL EXAMINERS
By:

COMPLAINT
The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

(Board), by and through Aaron Bart Fricke, J.D., General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Rajeev Sharad Khamamkar, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 8597). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on April 8, 1998.

2. Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) is a specific anesthesia service for a diagnostic or
therapeutic procedure. Indications for MAC include the nature of the procedure, the individual's
clinical condition and/or the potential need to convert to a general or regional anesthetic.

3. MAC includes all aspects of anesthesia care: a pre-procedure visit, intra-procedure
care, and post-procedure anesthesia management. During MAC, the anesthesiologist provides or
medically directs a number of specific services, including but not limited to:

a. Diagnosis and treatment of clinical problems that occur during the procedure;

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Victor M. Muro, M.D., Chair,
Weldon Havins, M.D., Member, and Ms. Maggie Arias-Petrel, Public Member.

15,

b. Support of vital functions;
c. Administration of sedatives, analgesics, hypnotics, anesthetic agents or other
medications as necessary for patient safety;

d. Psychological support and physical comfort;

e. Provision of other medical services as needed to complete the procedure safely.
MAC may include varying levels of sedation, analgesia, and anxiolysis as necessary. The provider
of MAC must be prepared and qualified to convert to general anesthesia when necessary. If the
individual loses consciousness and the ability to respond purposefully, the anesthesia care is a
general anesthetic, irrespective of whether airway instrumentation is required.

4. MAC is not medically necessary for interventional pain procedures in individuals
at average risk related to use of anesthesia and sedation. The use of MAC may be medically
necessary for interventional pain procedures when specific risk factors or significant medical
conditions are present, and when the proceduralist and anesthesiologist truthfully document these
factors and conditions.

5. The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System
is used for classifying individuals for the purposes of anesthesia for surgical operations. Under this
system:

a. ASA 1 or Lisa normal, healthy individual;

b. ASA 2 or Il is an individual with mild systemic disease;

c. ASA 3 or III an individual with severe systemic disease;

d. ASA 4 or IV is an individual with severe systemic disease that is a constant
threat to life;

e. ASA 5 or V is a moribund individual who is not expected to survive
without the operation;

f. ASA 6 or VI is a declared brain-dead individual whose organs are being
harvested.

6. Pursuant to NRS 630.305(d), charging for services which were not rendered is

grounds for disciplinary action or denying licensure.
