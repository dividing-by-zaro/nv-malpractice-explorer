active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 16603). Respondent was

originally licensed by the Board on July 18, 2016.

2. Patient A* was a seventy-eight (78) year old female at all times relevant to this

fall and was seen at Sunrise Hospital Medical Center where Respondent performed an open
reduction internal fixation surgery on Patient A’s right shoulder.

4. Respondent continued treating Patient A after her release from Sunrise Hospital
and ordered Patient A to undergo physical therapy. However, Patient A was in inexplicable,
unimproving pain during the entire course of her physical therapy with pain scale rating of 8/9 out
of 10 continually.

5. On October 8, 2018, Respondent reviewed x-rays taken on September 25, 2018 at
Steinberg Diagnostic Center and noted “{a] possible intra-articular perforation of screw” and
mentioning the patient did not have the improvement she would expect by this time in her
recovery. Respondent did not address any further investigation into the perforation of the screw
and instead treated the patient with additional physical therapy.

6. Patient A discontinued her medical care with Respondent and received a second
opinion from a different orthopedic physician who identified the penetrated screw and performed
a revision surgery to correct it relieving the patient from the pain from which she was suffering.

7. The IC requested a copy of all medical records and diagnostic tests within the file
kept for the patient by Respondent. The x-rays taken September 25, 2018 and evaluated by
Respondent were not included, nor was the report, in her response to the IC’s request.

and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient” constitute

health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

20. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care provider to address the
doubtfulness of the diagnosis of Patient A’s medical condition and such a timely consultation
would have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis and may have enhanced the quality of medical

care provided to the Patient with regard to the screw perforation in her shoulder.
