In the Matter of Charges and Complaint Case No. 21-40701-1

Against FI LE D
CLAUDE ROOFIAN, M.D., JUL 16 2021

Respondent. NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
AL EXAMINERS

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Robert Kilroy, Esq., General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Claude Roofian, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and
allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 14818). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 1, 2013, and has listed his specialties in family medicine
and as a hospitalist.

2. On June 17, 2015, Patient A* had brain surgery performed by Valley Hospital
Medical Center neurosurgical team for a “supracellar cyst possible craniopharyngioma and
hydrocephalus.” The neurosurgical team medical records did not indicate that Patient A’s tumor
(cyst) was malignant, cancerous, or terminal from a neurosurgical perspective, but rather stated

that Patient A’s condition diagnosis was craniopharyngioma.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, the IC was composed of Board members Rachakonda D, Prabhu, M.D.,
Chairman, Victor M. Muro, M.D, and Ms. Sandy Peltyn, public member.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On June 19, 2015, Patient A was discharged from Valley Hospital to home hospice
care. Respondent treated Patient A and signed Orders/Plan of Care stating the following: “I certify
that based on the factors evaluated as above that the above named patient is terminally ill and has a
limited life expectancy and medical prognosis of six (6) months or less if the illness runs its normal
course.” Respondent stated that Patient A’s primary diagnosis was MALIG NEO BRAIN NOS
(malignant brain neoplasm). Certification of Patient A being terminally ill was based upon
Respondent’s incorrect diagnosis of malignant brain neoplasm.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) (Malpractice)

4, All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

5. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

6. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

7. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he provided medical services to Patient A because he incorrectly diagnosed Patient A with
malignant brain neoplasm.

8. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT I
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) (Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records)

9. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

10. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds

for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

11. | Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to document his actions when he treated Patient A,
whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete when he documented an
incorrect diagnosis and did not update this error in a timely manner.

12. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT It
(NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) (Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation)

13. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

14. Violation of a standard of practice established by regulation of the Board is
grounds for imitating disciplinary action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

15. | NAC 630.210 requires a physician to seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the

quality of medical services.

16. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s medical
condition of craniopharyngioma. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care
provider to address the doubtfulness of the diagnosis of this condition. This consultation would
have confirmed or denied such a diagnosis rather than Respondent’s incorrect diagnosis of
malignant brain neoplasm.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1, That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give him
notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2) within
twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been

a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and

6. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these

premises.
