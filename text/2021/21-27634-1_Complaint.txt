COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Robert G. Kilroy, Esq., Senior Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the
IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Randi Fultz Grinsell, M.D., (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)
Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s
charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10448). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on April 9, 2003.

2. On July 2, 2015, Patient A’ had her first encounter with Respondent as she was
transferred from another provider. Respondent obtained her prior medical history, family history,
and reviewed her immunization record. During the visit, Patient A denied any family history of
cancer. Respondent acknowledged that Patient A was scheduled for a pap smear test (PAPT) as a

part of her examination.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Rachakonda Prabhu, M.D., Mr. M. Neil
Duxbury, and Victor M. Muro, M.D.

2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient

Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On July 13, 2015, Patient A submitted her endocervical sample for the PAPT.
Respondent rendered no further medical services or treatments with Patient A, but for referring
her to a gynecologist since she indicated her interest in a possible ablation procedure.

4. On July 16, 2015, Patient A’s PAPT results were received and indicated the
following cytology: “epithelial cell abnormality with atypical glandular cells” documented by the
pathologist Dr. Delrosario (M.D.). Respondent did not inform Patient A regarding the
aforementioned PAPT results because she did not know where to locate the cytology results in
Patient A’s electronic medical records.

5. On July 17, 2015, Respondent generated a letter for Patient A with the following,
“Your PAP test was normal...There is no need for further testing at this time.” It is unknown
whether Respondent sent the letter or whether Patient A actually received this misinformation.

6. On July 18, 2016, Patient A had subsequent PAPT from a different medical
provider, who noted that Patient A had atypical glandular cells on her 2015 PAPT cytology report
from the PAPT performed by Respondent. During this encounter, Patient A was notified of the
aforementioned 2015 PAPT results.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) (Malpractice)

7. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

8. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

9. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

10. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
she provided medical services to Patient A, because she did not timely inform Patient A of the
2015 PAPT results.

reference as though fully set forth herein.

13. | NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

14. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to document her actions when she treated Patient A,
whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete. Specifically, she failed to
document and inform the patient of the 2015 PAPT results.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT Tit

18. | NAC 630.210 requires a physician to seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.

enhanced treatment of Patient A’s medical condition by addressing Patient A’s medical condition
after the 2015 PAPT results indicated “epithelial cell abnormality.”
