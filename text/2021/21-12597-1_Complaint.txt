13. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

14. Pursuant to NAC 630.187, the Board adopted by reference the Model Policy on the
Use of Opioid Analgesics in the Treatment of Chronic Pain, July 2013, published by the
Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States, Inc. (Model Policy).

15. Pursuant to NAC 630.230(1)(k), a licensee shall not engage in the practice of
writing prescriptions for controlled substances to treat acute pain or chronic pain in a manner that
deviates from the Model Policy.

16. Respondent failed to conduct any detailed neurologic or musculoskeletal
examinations that would establish medical reasoning for Patient A to receive long-term opioid
medication for pain control.

17. Respondent failed to recommend other conservative treatments before or
concurrent with long-term opioid therapy including, but not limited to, physical therapy, exercise
and movement, or massage therapy, among others, which may have alleviated these findings on
physical examination.

18. Pursuant to the Model Policy, a physician’s patient evaluation should include,
without limitation: a complete medical history and a physical examination targeted to the pain
condition, evaluation of the nature and intensity of the pain, and history of current and past
treatments, including interventional treatments. Respondent maintained records of only four (4)
patient encounters, and otherwise consistently failed to include such information in Respondent’s
medical records for Patient A.

19.  Respondent’s records do not contain or show any indication of recent or
contemporaneous imaging (e.g. X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans) that would substantiate the need for
long-term opioids for pain control.

20. Based on, but not limited to, the foregoing, Respondent wrote prescriptions to
Patient A for opioid analgesics to treat chronic pain in a manner that deviated from the Model
Policy.

C. RESPONDENT’S TREATMENT OF PATIENT C

38. Patient C* was a patient of Respondent between March 13, 2013, and
December 17, 2014.

39. Patient C died of acute oxycodone and morphine toxicity on January 17, 2015.

40. Patient C had multiple medical conditions, and Respondent saw Patient C
approximately once a month between March 2013 and December 2014. Despite Patient C having
multiple severe medical conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an
abdominal “mass,” severe and chronic renal insufficiency, seizures, and demonstrated opiate
dependence and drug seeking behavior; Respondent routinely prescribed to Patient C multiple
sedating and dangerous medications, in very large doses, on a monthly basis with minimal or no
additional work-ups, referrals, consultation requests, diagnostic tests, treatment plans, or
evaluations of Patient C’s chronic “pain” or other problems.

41. On at least one (1) visit, Respondent documented a “RLQ MASS — HUGE,” yet on
subsequent visits the “mass” was not even mentioned. On at least one (1) visit, Respondent
documented “back pain,” but also documented a normal physical exam (e.g., “Back- normal, no
tenderness”). Respondent did refer the patient for an abdominal CT scan on one (1) occasion and
to a surgeon on another occasion, however these referrals were not completed, and Respondent
did not follow-up on them.

42. In September of 2014, a laboratory evaluation ordered by Respondent revealed
severe chronic kidney disease with a serum creatinine of over 6 and a BUN of over 70. These
abnormal test results were also documented in a Valley Hospital laboratory result the same month
(BUN 81 and creatinine 6.9). Respondent referred Patient C to a nephrologist, but was informed
in writing that Patient C never made an appointment.

43. Despite being informed that Patient C did not see the nephrologist as referred,
Respondent documented the next month, on a visit on October 22, 2014, that Patient C “was seen
by a nephrologist and told her kidneys were ok.” By this point in time, Respondent knew or

should have known, by lab reports that she possessed, that Patient C was essentially in “end stage”

4 Patient C’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his or her identity, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation contemporaneously served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

kidney disease, yet Respondent did nothing more to address Patient C’s obvious and serious renal
failure.

44. Each and every month that Respondent saw Patient C, almost without exception,
Respondent prescribed Patient C very large volumes and high doses of opioids (usually between
ninety (90) and one hundred twenty (120) tablets of thirty (30) mg oxycodone) and
benzodiazepines (usually ninety (90) tablets of the two (2) mg Xanax). In addition, Respondent
often prescribed ninety (90) pills of the muscle relaxant carisoprodol (Soma) concurrently.
Patient C’s other medical conditions noted herein, including COPD, renal failure, and seizure
disorder, were not addressed by Respondent at all or only in a cursory fashion.

45. Respondent documented during a visit on April 15, 2013, that Patient C was “still
on methadone,” yet, went on to prescribe large doses and volumes of opioids, benzodiazepines
and muscle relaxants routinely, every month (alprazolam, clonazepam, and Ativan were all
prescribed) for another full year. In such a situation, the standard of care dictates that only the pain
management physician should be providing opioid analgesics for Patient C.

46. Patient C, who had COPD and was obese, was at a particularly high risk for
morbidity and mortality from respiratory depression from the combination of high-dose sedative
medications prescribed by Respondent. In addition, Patient C’s severe and chronic kidney disease
further increased her risk of morbidity and mortality. Additional necessary evaluations for her
pain, anxiety, kidney disease, abdominal “mass,” and COPD were not undertaken, and appropriate
specialty consultations and referrals were not pursued
