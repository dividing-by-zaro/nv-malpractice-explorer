Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

1, Respondent is, and was at all times relevant to this case, a physician licensed to
practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 7986). His license was originally issued
by the Board on September 23, 1996.

identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with a
copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A was a healthy, 30-year-old female in February 2018, when she presented
to Respondent for liposuction in her lower back, abdomen, and flanks, and fat transfer into her!
buttocks. The foregoing is commonly referred to as a “Brazilian Butt Lift” procedure (hereinafter,

the “Operation”), a procedure with a risk of death far greater than any other cosmetic surgeries.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal Comy
‘was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Chairman, Aury Nagy, M.D., and
Michael C. Edwards, M.D., FACS.
