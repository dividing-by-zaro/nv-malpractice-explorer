COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through BRANDEE MOONEYHAN, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney
for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that ROGER ESTEVEZ, M.D. (Respondent)
violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative
Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint,
stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 13199). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on July 13, 2009.

2. At all times relevant to this Complaint, Respondent held either an active or expired
Nevada Controlled Substance Registration, Certificate No. CS18169, issued by the Nevada State
Board of Pharmacy (Pharmacy Board).

3. In 2018, Respondent failed to timely renew his Controlled Substance Registration,
and it therefore expired on October 31, 2018.

4. Respondent’s Controlled Substance Registration was reinstated by the Pharmacy

Board on April 11, 2019.

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Bret W. Frey, M.D., Chair, Aury Nagy, M.D.,
and Col. Eric D. Wade, USAF (Ret.).

5. Between November 1, 2018, and March 28, 2019, while his Controlled Substance
Registration was expired, Respondent wrote one hundred eighty-nine (189) prescriptions for
controlled substances.

6. On July 18, 2019, the Pharmacy Board found that by writing one hundred eighty-
nine (189) prescriptions for controlled substances between November 1, 2018, and
March 28, 2019, without a valid Controlled Substance Registration, Respondent violated,
attempted to violate, assisted or abetted in the violation of, or conspired to violate
NRS 453.226(1), NRS 453.32\(l)(a), NRS 639.100(1), NRS 639.2813(1) and/or

of chapter 639 of NRS that is applicable to a licensee who is a practitioner, as defined in
NRS 639.0125, is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

10. NRS 639.100(1) prohibits the prescription of controlled substances except as
authorized by law.

11. NRS 639.2813(1) prohibits a person from falsely representing himself as a
practitioner entitled to write prescriptions in this state.

hundred eighty-nine (189) prescriptions for controlled substances when he did not have a current
Controlled Substance Registration.

13. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
