ORDER DENYING APPLICATION FOR LICENSURE

The application of Zvika Jacob Schreiber, M.D. (Applicant), for a license to practice medicine
in the State of Nevada came before the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) at its
regularly scheduled meeting on Friday, March 5, 2021. The meeting of the Board was held exclusively
through telephonic means pursuant to the Emergency Directives issued by the Governor of Nevada, and
a quorum was present. The Applicant appeared telephonically in pro per.

At the appearance, proof was made to the satisfaction of the Board that the application ought to
be denied.

IT IS SO ORDERED that the application be, and hereby is, DENIED because the application
contained false, misleading, inaccurate and incomplete statements in violation of NRS 630.304(1),
which constitutes sufficient grounds for denying licensure. Further, the application contains the same,
repeated false, misleading, inaccurate and incomplete statements as Applicant made to other state
medical boards, for which Applicant was previously disciplined by those other boards, which also
constitutes sufficient grounds for denying licensure pursuant to NRS 630.301(3).




The Applicant may appeal this Order pursuant to NRS 630.200!.
