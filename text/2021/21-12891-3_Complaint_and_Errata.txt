MPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Robert G. Kilroy, Esq., General Counsel and attomey for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Sajjad Ejaz Kamboj, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and
allegations as follows:

1, Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a Medical Doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 9203). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on October 20, 1999.

2. A grievance was reported to the IC alleging that Patient A? complained of chest
pain for many years to Respondent without resolution eventually leading to Patient A’s demise.

3. Approximately two thousand four hundred forty-two (2,442) pages of |
correspondence and medical records were reviewed by the IC for Patient A. It was discovered

upon the review of the medical records that an extensive amount of “cloning” of prior records

occurred without further analysis or treatment for years.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board Members Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, Chairman, Aury Nagy,
M.D. and Michael C. Edwards, M.D., FACS

? Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint

i"

4, Within Patient A’s medical records, under the “Subjective” section, Respondent
used the same language (“cloning”) regarding Patient A’s medical condition, “He denies any
significant problems other than some chest pain and shortness of breath.” This aforementioned
language was the same for all of the following visits with Patient A: November 16, 2012,
March 7, 2012, August 29, 2012, December 12, 2012, June 26, 2013, July 24, 2013,
November 7, 2013, June 18, 2014 (at this encounter, Respondent recommends several tests
including a sleep study, a cardiac stress test, and an echocardiogram), December 14, 2017,
February 17, 2015 (Respondent documents a “murmur” and a showing of mild LVH and
AV sclerosis), February 19, 2015 (Respondent documents a normal nuclear treadmill stress test),
February 5, 2015, May 6, 2015, September 9, 2015, March 2, 2016 (Respondent documents a
hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis), June 8, 2016 (Respondent documents the following:
“questionable atypical chest pain, left arm pain has subsided, complaining of some left arm pain,
denies any significant chest pain, some chest pain and shortness of breath more than likely
secondary to hypertension, and clear him for surgery as a high cardiac risk”), September 7, 2016
(Respondent documents clone language from the June 8, 2016 record); September 21, 2016 (is the
same as the June 8, 2016 record); November 30, 2016 (Respondent documents diagnosis of sleep
apnea and uses the same clone language), July 5, 2017 (Respondent notes sleep apnea and uses the
same clone language), and July 25, 2018 (Respondent notes “due to some software-related issues
we are not able to download and save the echocardiogram and informed [Patient A] that he would
have to come back to do another echocardiogram.”)..

5. On September 23, 2019, Respondent replied to the IC’s allegation letter and stated
that Patient A’s care was “free of charge for many years...had cardiac issues but never of a
concern at that time...he never complained of chest pain.”

COUNTI
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) (Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records)
6. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

reference as though fully set forth herein.


7. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds for
initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

8. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A when Respondent used cloned phrases and documented
contradictory and mutually exclusive remarks as noted previously. Patient A’s medical records
indicate that he was experiencing chest pain from 2011 through the end of 2015 without any
acknowledgement, explanation, assessment or treatment by Respondent.

9. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed;

5. That the Board award fees and costs as outlined in NRS 622.400 for the
investigation and prosecution of this disciplinary action; and

6. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these
premises.
