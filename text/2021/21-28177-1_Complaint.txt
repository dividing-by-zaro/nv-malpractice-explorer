By:

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Robert G. Kilroy, Esq., General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Jose Hiram Alvarez, M.D. (Respondent) violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630
(collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and
allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a Medical Doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 10765). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on December 5, 2003.

2. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.
3. On July 7, 2014, Patient A presented to Respondent for an initial consultation.

4. On June 23, 2016, Patient A undergoes surgery, including liposuction,
abdominoplasty and a fat transfer to her buttocks, as performed by Respondent.

5. On June 27, 2016, Patient A attended a follow-up evaluation conducted by

Respondent, who treats her with the beginning of laser treatments to her healing areas.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal Complaint
was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Aury Nagy, M.D., and

Respondent’s medical records do not document the laser settings used upon Patient A. Improper
laser settings (too high) have been clinicially shown to cause the laser to penetrate into the tissue,
getting absorbed into the lipids which creates a thermal effect. Patient A’s damaged areas were due
to her having full-thickness burns and tissue necrosis following Respondent’s care.

6. From June 29, 2016 through July 18, 2016, Patient A received oral antibiotics and
Respondent treated Patient A with his staff (Medical Assistant/Receptionist) and a licensed
Esthetician? for a total of ten (10) laser skin treatments. Respondent’s medical records do not
include any treatments or diagnoses for the aforementioned Patient A’s lesions, which were likely
caused by the burns and necrosis.

7. On August 10, 2016, Patient A presents to the UMC burn unit and begins treatments
including debridement and wound care through September 28, 2016 after receiving a second opinion
from a different plastic surgeon who referred her to a burn unit. Respondent’s medical records for
Patient A do not include any documentation regarding wound care, including debridement and
wound cleaning.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) (Malpractice)

8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

9. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

10. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

13. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

14. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

treatment and care of Patient A, by failing to document his actions when he treated Patient A,
whose medical records were not timely, legible, accurate, and complete.

16. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as

17. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

18. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

19. | NAC 630.210 requires a physician to seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.

20. Respondent failed to timely seek consultation with regard to Patient A’s post-
operative medical condition. Respondent should have consulted with an appropriate care provider
to address the aforementioned worsening conditions. This consultation could have enhanced
Patient A’s declining medical condition.

21. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
