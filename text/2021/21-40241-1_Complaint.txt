NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

Against:
ARNOLD DANIEL CHUNG, M.D.,

Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC)! of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through SARAH A. BRADLEY, J.D., Deputy Executive Director and attorney for
the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that ARNOLD DANIEL CHUNG, M.D.,
(Respondent), violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and the
Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively Medical Practice Act), hereby
issues its Complaint (Complaint), stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

d. Respondent was at all times relevant to this Complaint a licensed medical doctor
holding an active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 14527).
Respondent was originally licensed by the Board on August 29, 2012.

2. Patient A? was initially seen at University Medical Center Hospital (UMC) on
May 13, 2018 with complaints of chest pain. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of
Patient A’s chest was completed and a pulmonary nodule was identified on the scan. Nine (9)
samples of the nodule were taken while Patient A was in the hospital. All nine (9) samples tested
were negative for cancer pursuant to the pathology reports. Patient A was discharged from the

hospital accordingly.

' The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Victor M. Muro, M.D., Chair, Ms. April
Mastroluca, and Weldon Havins, M.D., J.D.

? Patient A’s name is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect his identity, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Respondent’s first encounter with Patient A occurred on July 3, 2018, wherein he
had a lengthy discussion with Patient A and ordered for a positron emission tomography (PET)
scan and bronchoscopy to be performed. Respondent determined the results to be lung cancer and
created a plan of care that consisted of further testing to rule out mediastinal disease, which
required a bronchoscopy and cervical mediastinoscopy. If the results of these tests were negative
for mediastinal disease, Respondent intended to proceed with a right upper lobectomy.

4. Patient A underwent the bronchoscopy and cervical mediastinoscopy on
July 13, 2018 which included lymph node biopsies. The pathology reports following the tenth
(10th) biopsy performed on the patient indicated the lymph nodes were, again, negative for cancer.

5. Respondent treated Patient A for lung cancer and removed the right upper portion
of Patient’s A’s lung.

6. Respondent’s letter to the Board dated September 11, 2019 providing his response
to the allegations in this case contained multiple statements regarding a diagnosis of lung cancer
for Patient A that are not corroborated by Patient A’s medical records.

7. Respondent submitted a second letter to the Board dated December 20, 2019,
providing additional responses to the allegations in this case that contained multiple statements
that are also not corroborated by Patient A’s medical records.

8. According to testing and his medical records, Patient A did not have lung cancer.

9. Malpractice as interpreted by the Board in NAC 630.040 “means the failure of a
physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.”

10. Performing a cancer operation in the absence of a cancer diagnosis is not “the
reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances” unless there
were mitigating circumstances, such as the location of a lesion.

11. Patient A’s lesion was not located in an area that a lobectomy was necessary in
order to receive a cancer diagnosis.

12. There was no mention by Respondent in Patient A’s medical records that he

considered a lesser resection, such as a wedge or segmentectomy.

13. In this case, using the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under
similar circumstances required that a physician initially confirm the preoperative diagnosis of lung
cancer before performing a lobectomy.

14. | The UMC discharge summary clearly indicated that Patient A had multiple
bronchoscopic biopsies, none of which were positive for cancer.

COUNT I
NRS 630.301(4) (Malpractice)

15. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

16. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

17. NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

18. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when
he removed the right upper portion of Patient’s A’s lung despite the fact that Patient A did not
have lung cancer and Patient A’s medical records did not support a lung cancer diagnosis.

19, By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
NRS 630.3062(1)(a) (Failure to Maintain Complete Medical Records)

20. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

21. NRS 630.3062(1)(a) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate
and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

22. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,

treatment and care of Patient A because Respondent’s statements to the Board contain information

that is not included in Patient A’s medical records and/or not supported by the information
included in Patient A’s medical records.

23. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an
Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

4. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it finds and concludes that
there has been a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, to include sanctions to be imposed; and

6. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these
premises.
