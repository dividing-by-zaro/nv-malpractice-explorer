COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee’ (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through BRANDEE MOONEYHAN, J.D., Deputy General Counsel and attorney
for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that RANDY HITT BUTLER, M.D., (Respondent)
violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative
Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint,
stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent was at all times relative to this Complaint a medical doctor holding an
active license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada (License No. 6224). Respondent was
originally licensed by the Board on March 16, 1991.

2. Patient A’ was a thirty-seven (37) year-old male when the events at issue began.

3. On or about April 21, 2015, Patient A presented to Respondent for an examination
due to a “non-tender knot on th[e] right testicle” that had been present for several months.

4. Respondent’s notes of the April 21, 2015, visit indicated that Patient A’s “[r]ight
testicle [was] smaller than left and probably atrophic,” and that Patient A had a “[s]mall 2-3mm

raised lump in inferior aspect of right testicle.” At this visit Respondent ordered an ultrasound of

Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D.,

Victor M. Muro, M.D., and Ms. Sandy Peltyn.
2 Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect his privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

Patient A’s scrotum and blood tests to measure Patient A’s prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels.
5. The ultrasound revealed, in part, that Patient A’s “right testicle demonstrates


3 separate solid hypoechoic lesions with some associated calcifications.” The ultrasound report
stated that the lesions and/or calcifications on Patient A’s right testicle were “suspicious in
nature.”

6. The test results of Patient A’s PSA and hGC levels were within normal ranges.

7. On or about May 10, 2015, Respondent and Patient A had a telephone conversation
to discuss the results of the ultrasound and PSA/hCG tests, during which he told Patient A that he
had “nothing to worry about” with respect to the lump in his right testicle and that no follow-up
care was necessary.

8. In September 2015, Patient A sought a second opinion from a different doctor
regarding the knot in his right testicle.

9. It was not until he was seeking a second opinion that Patient A received a copy of
his April 30, 2015, ultrasound.

10. Pursuant to the direction of the doctor providing a second opinion, Patient A had a
second scrotal ultrasound on September 15, 2015. This ultrasound indicated that two (2) of the
lesions on Patient A’s right testicle had grown since the April 2015 ultrasound.

11. The doctor providing a second opinion immediately referred Patient A to a
urologist.

12. The urologist recommended that Patient A undergo a radical orchiectomy of his
right testicle, which he did on October 2, 2015.

13. Subsequent pathology showed that the lesions in Patient A’s testicle were
cancerous, specifically, they were eighty per cent (80%) seminoma and twenty per cent (20%)
embryonal carcinoma with microvascular invasion indicated.

14. Respondent’s failure to recognize that an ultrasound showing hypoechoic lesions

required immediate referral to a urologist resulted in Patient A’s diagnosis and treatment for

testicular cancer being delayed by at least four (4) months.

COUNT I
NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2) — Violation of Standards of Practice Established by Regulation

15. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

16. Violation of a standard of practice adopted by the Board is grounds for disciplinary
action pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2).

17. | NAC 630.210 requires a physician to “seek consultation with another provider of
health care in doubtful or difficult cases whenever it appears that consultation may enhance the
quality of medical services.”

18. Respondent failed to seek consultation with a urologist to determine the appropriate
treatment after an ultrasound showing hypoechoic lesions in Patient A’s right testicle, which were
deemed “suspicious in nature,” and such consultation likely would have enhanced the quality of
medical care provided to Patient A by resulting in a more prompt diagnosis and treatment for

testicular cancer.

19. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

l. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in
NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it determines there has been
a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent,

4. That the Board award fees and costs for the investigation and prosecution of this
case as outlined in NRS 622.400;

5. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of fact,

conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed; and
