5. Vida Spa is, and was at all times relevant to this complaint, licensed in Clark
County, Nevada, under Clark County Business License No. 2003447.081-172, under the business
category of “Cosmetology Establishment - Other Services.” The owners listed under this license
are Art Matrix, Inc. and Gisselle Platfoot.

6. Gisselle Platfoot, Manager of Vida Spa, did not, at all times relevant to this
Complaint, hold a license to practice any healing art as a “provider of health care,” defined in
NRS 629.031, from any occupational licensing board in the State of Nevada.

7. Vida Spa is “a facility that provides health care, other than a medical facility”.
See NRS 449.442. Neither Respondent, Vida Spa, nor Gisselle Platfoot held, or currently holds,
the requisite permit, pursuant to NRS 449.442, to perform general anesthesia, conscious sedation
or deep sedation at Vida Spa. Additionally, neither Respondent, Vida Spa, nor Gisselle Platfoot
hold a current accreditation by a national recognized organization approved by the Nevada State
Board of Health (BOH) to perform general anesthesia, conscious sedation or deep sedation at
Vida Spa.

8. On March 24, 2021, the NSBOP issued two (2) separate Citations and Orders to
Cease and Desist, to Respondent, Vida Spa and Gisselle Platfoot, respectively, whereby the
NSBOP separately determined that Respondent, Vida Spa and Gisselle Platfoot were possessing
administering, prescribing and/or dispensing controlled substances and/or dangerous drugs for
Nevada patients from Vida Spa, in violation of state and federal law.

9. The NSBOP’s Citation to Respondent states that Respondent is possessing,
administering, prescribing and/or dispensing controlled substances and dangerous drugs for
Nevada patients from her practice in violation of federal and state law.

10. Specifically, this citation notes that her controlled substance registration was
suspended, and that she is prohibited from possessing and/or administering controlled substances.

11. | The NSBOP determined in this citation that Respondent has violated, attempted to

violate, assisted or abetted in the violation of or conspired to violate, without limitation,




NRS 453.226, NRS 453.316, NRS 453.321(1)(a), NRS 453.331(1)(c),(d),() & (i),

21 U.S.C. § 842(a), 21 U.S.C. § 846 and 21 CFR §§ 1306.03—1306.05.

12. The Citation ordered Respondent to immediately Cease and Desist possessing,
administering, prescribing and/or dispensing controlled substances for Nevada patients from her
practice, and also assessed an administrative fine of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00).

13. In addition to the violations of various state and federal laws pertaining to the
possessing, dispensing, and/or administering controlled substances and/or dangerous drugs that
are the subject of the NSBOP citations, between the dates of on or about April 13, 2021, to on or
about June 23, 2021, Respondent performed invasive surgical procedures, such as liposuction and
fat grafting, at Vida Spa.

14. As stated above, Vida Spa is not an accredited surgical facility and does not have a
permit and has never obtained a permit from the BOH to offer the service of general anesthesia,
conscious sedation or deep sedation to patients, pursuant to NRS 449.442(1).

15. Between, on or about April 13, 2021 and on or about June 23, 2021, Respondent
administered Propofol for the purposes of general anesthesia, conscious sedation or deep sedation

seventy-two (72) individual patients, all in violation of NRS 630.373, which provides in pertinent
part, that, in the State of Nevada, a physician shall not administer or supervise directly the

NRS 630.3062(1)(a) by falsifying her health care records for all fifty-nine (59) patients by failing
to note that she had administered Propofol, in an attempt to conceal the fact that Propofol was
being administered for the purpose of general anesthesia, conscious sedation or deep sedation at
an unpermitted and unaccredited facility, in violation of NRS 630.373.

18. Because Respondent omitted information from the health care records for all fifty-
nine (59) patients, these records were not timely, accurate, legible, or complete in violation of

19. Respondent violated the standards of practice pursuant to NRS 630.306(1)(b)(2)
and NAC 630.230(1)(a), by falsifying her patients’ records of health care, which is grounds for

20. Respondent further violated NRS 630.306(1)(p), which provides that engaging in
any act that is considered unsafe or unprofessional conduct, in accordance with regulations
adopted by the Board, constitutes grounds for initiating disciplinary action, when she falsified
medical records for the purpose of concealing the use of Propofol for general anesthesia,

violation of NRS 630.373(1), which is unsafe and unprofessional conduct, in each of the fifty-nine

(59) instances.
