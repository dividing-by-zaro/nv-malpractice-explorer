Las Vegas, NV 89101



FINDINGS OF FACT

I.

Respondent held a license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada at all relevant
times.

Il.

A complaint was filed by the Investigative Committee against Respondent in March of
2008 alleging violations of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

III.

The complaint alleged that on his October 2006 re-application for a medical license,
Respondent indicated that he was currently certified by the American Board of Family
Medicine. Respondent was granted a license in December of 2006, after an appearance
before the Board, with the condition that he maintains that certification. On Respondent's May
2007 renewal, he again indicated that he was certified. However, ABFM had revoked
Respondent's certification in 2002 and had notified him by a certified letter of such revocation
in February of 2002.

IV.

The complaint in Count | alleged that the Respondent obtained a license to practice
medicine by misrepresentation and by a false, misleading and inaccurate statement in
violation of NRS 630.304(1) when he indicated on his October 2006 application for licensure
and to the Board during his December 2006 appearance that he was certified by the ABFM at

the time of the application when in actuality his status had been revoked.

V.

The complaint in Count Il alleged that the Respondent renewed a license to practice
medicine by misrepresentation and by a false, misleading and inaccurate statement in
violation of NRS 630.304(1) when he indicated during the renewal process that he remained

certified by the ABFM when in actuality his status had been revoked.

VI.
The Board finds that Respondent violated NRS 630.304(1), as set forth in counts | and
ll of the Complaint by making misrepresentations during the initial re-licensing application and
on the subsequent renewal, to wit, that he was certified by the ABFM when that certification

had been revoked.
Vil.

The Board finds by a preponderance of the evidence, that Respondent's conduct is a

violation of NRS Chapter 630 and discipline is warranted.
VIII.
lf any of the foregoing Findings of Fact is more properly deemed a Conclusion of Law,

it may be so construed.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

I.

The Board has jurisdiction over Respondent.

Il.

Respondent was properly served with notice of the hearing before the Hearing Officer,

pursuant to NRS and NAC Chapters 630 and NRS Chapter 233B.
Il.

The Board concludes that Respondent misrepresented his status with the ABFM during
the initial process for re-licensing in 2007 and again in his 2007 renewal. Respondent's
misrepresentations, as described above, are violations of NRS 630.304(1) and thus
Respondent is subject to discipline.

IV.
lf any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law is more properly deemed a Findings of Fact,

it may be so construed.
