FINDINGS OF FACT
I.

Respondent held a license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada at all relevant
times.

I.

A Motion for Order to Show Cause was filed by the Investigative Committee against
Respondent in September of 2008 alleging that Respondent had failed to comply with a
previously entered into Settlement Agreement with the Board.

I.

A Complaint and Request for Summary Suspension was previously filed against
Respondent on August 21, 2007 containing one count of willful failure to obey an Order of a
committee designated by the Board to investigate a complaint against a physician, a violation
of NRS 630.3065; one count of malpractice, a violation of NRS 630.301(4); and one count of
inability to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety because of illness, a mental or
physical condition or the use of alcohol, drugs, narcotics or other substances, a violation of
NRS 630.306(1). Based upon that Complaint, the adjudicating members of the Board
summarily suspended Respondent's license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada on
August 22, 2007.

The matter was resolved by a Settlement, Waiver and Consent Agreement which was
signed by Respondent and was adopted by the adjudicating members of the Board on
November 30, 2007. In the settlement agreement, Respondent admitted to an inability to
practice with reasonable skill and safety because of illness, a mental or physical condition or
the use of alcohol, drugs, narcotics or other substances as set forth in the Complaint and the
Board imposed a revocation of Respondent’s license to practice medicine in the state of
Nevada, however the revocation was stayed and Respondent was place on probation for a

period of five years with numerous conditions.

it may be so construed.
