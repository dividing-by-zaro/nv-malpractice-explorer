I.

Respondent held a license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada at all relevant

Respondent in August of 2008 alleging that Respondent had failed to comply with a previously
entered into Settlement Agreement with the Board.

Ml.

A Complaint and Request for Summary Suspension was filed against Respondent on
November 26, 2007 based upon which the adjudicating member of the Board summarily
suspended Respondent's license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada. On November
28, 2007, an Amended Complaint and Request for Summary Suspension was filed containing
the same counts as set forth in the Complaint of November 26, 2007.

On February 20, 2008, a Second Amended Complaint was filed against Respondent
containing two counts of engaging in conduct which is intended to deceive, violations of NRS
630.306(2)(a), one count of dependency on a controlled substance, a violation of NRS
630.306(10) and one count of prescribing a controlled substance or dangerous drug to himself
or other except as authorized by law, a violation of NRS 630.306(3).

The matter was resolved by a Settlement, Waiver and Consent Agreement which was
signed by Respondent and was adopted by the adjudicating members of the Board on March
28, 2008. In the settlement agreement, Respondent admitted to all counts alleged in the
Second Amended Complaint and the Board imposed a revocation of Respondent's license to
practice medicine in the state of Nevada, however the revocation was stayed and Respondent

was place on probation for a period of five years with numerous conditions.
