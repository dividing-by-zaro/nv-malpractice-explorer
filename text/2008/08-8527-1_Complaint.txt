630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as
follows:

1. Respondent was granted a license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada on
December 2, 1989, and was so licensed by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes up until July 1, 2007, when Respondent
requested that his licensure status be changed to inactive status, which it currently remains.

2. Respondent was granted a license to practice medicine in the state of California on or
about October 27, 1972. On March 1, 2007, the state of California filed a one-count Accusation against
Respondent alleging gross negligence on the part of Respondent, in his care and treatment of multiple
patients.

3. Thereafter, on August 30, 2007, the state of California entered an Order revoking
Respondent’s license to practice medicine, however, that revocation was stayed, and Respondent was

placed on probation with various conditions for a period of five years beginning on August 30, 2007.




4. Section 630.301(3) of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that the suspension,
modification or limitation of the license to practice any type of medicine by any other jurisdiction is
grounds for disciplinary action.

5. The stayed revocation of Respondent’s license to practice medicine in the state of
California, constitute violations of the provisions of NRS 630.301(3).

6. Based upon the forgoing, Respondent has violated Nevada Revised Statute 630.301(3),
and is subject to discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Nevada
Revised Statute 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1, That the Board fix a time and place for a formal hearing;

2. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him, the time and place
set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions against him;

3, That the Board determine what sanctions it determines to impose for the violation or
violations committed by Respondent; and

law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed.
