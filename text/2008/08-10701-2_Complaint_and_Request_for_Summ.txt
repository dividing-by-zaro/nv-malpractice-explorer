COMPLAINT AND REQUEST FOR SUMMARY SUSPENSION
The Investigative Committee of the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of Nevada,

composed of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, Benjamin J. Rodriquez, M.D., Member, and
Jean Stoess, M.A., Member, by and through Lyn E. Beggs, General Counsel for the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners, having a reasonable basis to believe that STEPHEN SELDON, M.D.,

4. Botulinum neurotoxin type A has been approved by the Federal Drug
Administration (FDA) for human use for limited purposes and the only FDA approved
manufacturer of botulinum neurotoxin type A is Allergen, using the brand name Botox.

5. Beginning in October 2003 and through September 2005, Dr. Seldon and
Mrs. Seldon began purchasing botulinum neurotoxin type A from a company called Toxin
Research International, Inc. (hereinafter TRI). TRI was based in Tucson, Arizona and was not an
approved manufacturer of botulinum neurotoxin type A for human use. The botulinum
neurotoxin type A manufactured and sold by TRI was called TRItox. TRItox is not and has
never been approved for human use, and, in fact, each vial was labeled, “For research purposes
only, not for human use.” TRI’s invoices also contained the warning, “For research purposes
only, not for human use.”

6. Despite the labeling and warnings regarding the TRItox not being for human use,
Dr. Seldon administered the TRItox to patients of “A New You.” Dr. Seldon did not inform the
patients that he was administering TRItox to them rather than the FDA-approved Botox. In the
course of conducting the business of “A New You,” Dr. Seldon and “A New You” made certain
representations regarding Dr. Seldon’s training by Allergan, Dr. Seldon’s expertise based upon
that training, and Dr. Seldon’s use of Botox.

7. On June 27, 2007, Dr. Seldon and Mrs. Seldon were charged by a Criminal
Indictment resultant from a federal grand jury in the case entitled United States v. Stephen Lee
Seldon, M.D. and Deborah Martinez Seldon (U.S. Dist. Ct. Nev. Case No. 07-CR-0135-KJD-
LRL). In the Criminal Indictment, Dr. Seldon and Mrs. Seldon were each charged with fourteen
counts of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1341, punishable by up to twenty years in prison for each
count and one count of misbranding a drug while held for sale under 21 U.S.C. § 331(k),
punishable by up to three years in prison. (See Exhibit A)

8. On November 19, 2008, after a ten day jury trial, the jury found Dr. Seldon and

| Mrs. Seldon each to be guilty of all fifteen counts made against them in the Criminal Indictment.

Sentencing on the convictions is scheduled for February 19, 2009. The Seldons were released on

their own recognizance pending sentencing. (See Exhibit B)

9. Based on the conviction of Dr. Seldon, the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy
immediately suspended the controlled substance registration of Dr. Seldon pursuant to
NRS 639.2121 on November 24, 2008. (See Exhibit C)

10. On November 7, 2008, the Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners filed a formal disciplinary complaint against Dr. Seldon alleging two counts
of malpractice and one count of failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete
medical records relating to a patient who underwent tumescent liposuction by Dr. Seldon in
October 2007. The patient at issue in that matter died less than 48 hours after undergoing the
procedure. (See Exhibit D)

COUNT I

11. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth
herein.

12. NRS 630.301(1) provides that conviction of a felony relating to the practice of
medicine or the ability to practice medicine is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

13. Dr. Seldon’s recent convictions in federal court all relate to his medical practice at
“A New You” and specifically to his use of TRItox, in place of Botox, unbeknownst to his
patients.

14. Accordingly, Dr. Seldon has violated NRS 630.301(1) and is subject to
disciplinary action as provided by NRS 630.352.

COUNT

15. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth
herein.

16. NRS 630.301(11)(f) provides that conviction of a violation of any federal or state
law regulating the possession, distribution or use of any controlled substance or any dangerous
drug is ground for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

17. Dr. Seldon’s conviction for fourteen counts of mail fraud relating to the purchase
and use of TRItox and one count of misbranding a drug while held for sale are violations of

Mit

federal law and accordingly Dr. Seldon has violated NRS 630.01(11)(f) and is subject to
disciplinary action as provided by NRS 630.352.
COUNT I

18. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated by reference as though fully set forth
herein.

19. NRS 630.306(7) provides that continual failure to exercise the skill or diligence or
use the methods ordinarily exercised under the same circumstances by physicians in good
standing practicing in the same specialty or field is grounds for initiating disciplinary action
against a licensee.

20. Dr. Seldon’s actions, as proven in federal court, and those alleged in the recent
filing of a formal disciplinary action against him show an on-going and continual failure to
exercise the skill or diligence or use the methods ordinarily exercised under the same
circumstances by physicians in good standing practicing in the same specialty or field.

21. Accordingly, Dr. Seldon has violated NRS 630.306(7) and is subject to
disciplinary action as provided by NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical
Examiners prays as follows:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners schedule an emergency meeting
by telephone conference pursuant to NRS 241.020, and that the Board review the above Complaint,
with exhibits, and any other evidence, argument or presentation, find that Dr. Seldon poses a threat
to the health and safety of patients he sees and treats, or may see and treat, as well as the public in
general. He has recently been convicted of conduct in federal court that placed his patients at risk
and showed a substantial disregard for their safety and welfare. He faces the possibility of
substantial prison time, however he remains out of custody and is believed to be presently engaged
in the practice of medicine. Accordingly Dr. Seldon is able to engage in the same course of conduct
that gave rise to the federal criminal action and the formal disciplinary complaint filed by this
Committee and thus the Investigative Committee requests that the Nevada State Board of Medical

of law, and an order imposing sanctions upon Dr. Seldon according to NRS 630.352; and

DEFENDANTS.

THE GRAND JURY CHARGES THAT:

At all times relevant to this Indictment:

Introduction

1. Defendant STEPHEN LEE SELDON, a medical doctor, schemed with
defendant DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON, his wife and the manager of his medical practice,
to defraud his patients by treating them with a cheaper, non-FDA approved version of Botox®, a drug
used to reduce facial wrinkles. By misrepresenting to the patients of their medical practice the true
nature of the product they were using, STEPHEN LEE SELDON and DEBORAH MARTINEZ
SELDON enriched themselves while exposing patients to severe health risks.

Persons and Entities

2. STEPHEN LEE SELDON was a physician licensed by the State of Nevada

to practice medic-ne.

3. DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON was the manager of STEPHEN LEE
SELDON’S medical practice “A New You Medical Aesthetics” (“A New You”). As the office
manager, DEBORAH MARTINEZSELDON’S responsibilities included ordering supplies, paying
bills, managing personnel and managing the bank accounts at A New You.

4. Together, STEPHEN LEE SELDON and DEBORAH MARTINEZ
SELDON operated A New You in Las Vegas, Nevada. At A New You, STEPHEN LEE SELDON
advertised that he performed wrinkle reducing treatments using injections of Botox®, and other
cosmetic procedures.

Federal Regulation of Drugs and Biological Products

5. The FDA regulates the manufacture and distribution of drugs and biclozical
products in the United States pursuant to the provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, Title

21, United States Code, Section 301, et. seg. (the “Act”). The FDA has established approval

‘procedures for evaluating new drugs and licensing biological products. Approval is required for each

new drug intended for human use before its introduction into interstate commerce is permitted. A

license is also required for each new biological product before its introduction into interstate
commerce is permitted,
6. A “drug” is defined by the Act as, among other things, any articles intended

for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseasc in man or other animals;

articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other

“animals; and articles intended for use as a component of any such articles. 21 U.S.C. § 321(g).

7. A “biological product” is defined as a“. . . toxin applicable to the prevention,
treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings.” 42 U.S.C. § 262(i). When a biclozical
product under this section also meets the definition ofa “drug,” as stated in Paragraph Five of this

Indictment, the “biologica) product” is a “drug” under 21 U.S.C, § 321(g).


Case 2:07-cr-00135-KJD-LkL Document 1 Filed 06/27/2007 Page 4 of 13

8. The FDA enforces drug safety and efficacy standards by guarding agamst the
misbranding of drugs. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 331(k), the doing of any act with respect to a drug, if
such act is done while the drug is held for sale (whether or not the first sale) after shipment in
interstate commerce results in such drug being adulterated or misbranded, and is prohibited. 21
U.S.C. § 33 1(k).

9. A drug is misbranded if, among other things, it is offered for sale under the
name of another drug. 21 U.S.C. § 352(1)(3).

Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A

10. The bacterium Clostridium Botulinum produces Botulinum Neurotoxin Type
A, a highly potent toxin. When present in sufficient degree in humans, Botulinum Neurotoxin ype
A can cause botuiism. Severe botulism paralyzes its victims and can <esult in death unless timely
medical itervention occurs

1. Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A can be both a drug under the Act, 21] U.S.C. §
321(g), and a biological product, 42 U.S.C. § 262(1), when the product is intended for use in the
diagnosis. cure, railigation, treatment or prevention of disease in husnan beings, or to affect the
structure or the function of the human body. Therefore, no form of Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A
can be distributed legally in interstate commerce for use on humans unless it has been approved by
the FDA as anew drug (or there is in effect with the FDA a new drug application, an abbreviated new
drug application, or a notice of claimed excmption for an investigational new drug), or it has seen

licensed as a biological product by the FDA.

Allergan Botox®
12 In or about December 1991, the FDA approved a biological products liccnse
for Botox:’®, the brand name ofa drug derived from Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A, manufactured by
Allergan, Inc., of irvine, California, for the treatment of certain disorders of the musclcs related to the

eyes.

Case 2:07-cr-00135-KJD-Lh. Document1 Filed 06/27/2007 Page 5 of 13

13. Inor about April 2002, the FDA approved a supplement to Allergan’s Botox@
license application for the treatment of glabellular lines, commonly referred to as forehead wrinkles.
Under this FDA approval, Allergan’s Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A product was marketed and
labeled for this supplemental usage as Botox® Cosmetic.

14. Botox® and Botox® Cosmetic (collectively “Bctox®”) is injected with a .
hypodermic need'e. It is used to temporarily smooth facial wrinkles. It works by paralyzing the
muscles that cause wrinkles. Once injected, it blocks the transmission of nerve impulses to the
muscles that receive the drug; this reduces the activity of the muscles that cause frown lines to forn:.

15. Botox® is the only product containing Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A
approved by the FDA for the treatment of glabellular lines in humans. Allergan, Inc. (“Allergan”)
of Irvine, California is the only approved manufacturer of Botox®. Accordingly, all doctors treating
patients with Botulinum Neurotoxin Type A are required to use Allergan’s Botox® products.

Toxin Research International, Inc.

16. Toxin Research International, Inc. (“TRI”) was an Arizona corporation with
ts principal place of business in Tucson, Arizona. TRJ was managed anc. controlled by Chad Livdahl
(“Livdahl”) and Zahra Karim (“Karim”).

17. During 2003 and 2004, TRI, through Livdahl and Karim, marketed and sold
a Botulinum Neurstoxin Type A (“TRItox”) that was neither approved nor licensed by FDA for use
on humans.

18. Although TRI marketed its TRItox to physicians and others involved in
patient treatments, it sold TRItox in vials that were labeled “For research purposes only, not for
human use.”

19, TRIs sales invoices, which accompanied orders of TRItox mailed to
physicians and others involved in patient treatments, also included the warning, “For research

purposes only, not for human use.”
Case 2:07-cr-00135-KJD-LxL Document1 — Filed 06/27/2007 Page 6 of 13

20. | TRI charged customers much less for its TRIox than Allergan charged

- customers for Botox®. By using TRItox instead of Botox®, physicians and others involved in patient

treatments could increase their profits on each treatment.

COUNTS ONE THROUGH FOURTEEN
(Mail Fraud)

21. The Grand Jury incorporates by reference the allegations in Paragraphs One
through Twenty, zbove, as though fully set forth hercin.
22. From on or about October 15, 2003, until on or about September 16, 2005,
in the State and Federal District of Nevada, and elsewhere,
STEPHEN LEE SELDON, MD and
DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON,
defendants herein, aided and abetted by each other, did devise and intend to devise a scheme and
artifice to defraud, and for obtaining money and property by means of fa se and fraudulent pretenses,
representations and promises, which scheme and artifice involved fraudulently obtaming money from
patients by substituting cheaper, non-FDA approved TRiItox in treatments provided to patients at A
New You, while falsely and fraudulently representing to the patients that they were receiving
injections of the more expensive, FDA-approved Botox®.

Scheme and Artifice to Defraud

23, It was part of the scheme and artifice that STEPHEN LEE SELDON and
Deborah Martinez Seldon defrauded patients by misleading them to believe that they were receiving
the FDA-approved drug Botox®, when, in fact, the patients were receiving TRitox, which was not
FDA-approved and exposed the patients to severe health risks.

24. As part of the scheme and artifice, Stephen Lee Seldon and Deborah
Martinez Seldon jointly opcrated A New You in Las Vegas, Nevada, at which they offered and

advertised Botox® injections.

25. As part of the scheme and artifice, STEPHEN LEE SELDON and Deborah
Martinez Seldon caused advertisements to be placed in local magazines, such as “Fun & Frit”,
“QVegas” and “The Phillipine Times,” which would offer “BOTOX $8 PER UNIT.” The typical
advertisement, which is substantially similar to the following, would represent that:

‘«.Dr. Seldon is Board Certified and has been specially trained by Allergan for all
your Botox needs.”

- The typical advertisements would further state,

“Don’t be fooled by Botox prices by the ‘area’, wrinkles vary in size and depth. Each

patient at [A New You] is charged by the unit & the amount of Botox needed for their

treatment. Botox is always mixed per Allergan Standards.”
These advertisements sought to create the false impression that STEPHEN LEE SELDON was using
Allergan’s Botox( for the treatment of his patient’s wrinkles when, in fact, he was not.

26. As part of ‘the scheme and artifice, STEPHEN LEE SELDON and
DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON caused Botox® promotional materials to be displayed and
distributed to prospective patients at A New You, when, in fact, patients were not recciving FDA-
approved Botox®.

27, As part of the scheme and artifice, STEPHEN LEE SELDON and .
DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON caused a certificate to be displayed on the wall at A New You
which identified STEPHEN LEE SELDON us having been trained in the application of Botox®,
when, in fact, STEPHEN LEE SELDON had never altended any training sessions sponsored by
Allergan und has no Allergan-approved training in the use of Botox®.

28. As part of the scheme and artifice, STEPHEN LEE SELDON and
DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON caused patients to sign consent forms prior to receiving
cosmetic procedures. These patient consent forms fraudulently rep-esented that the defencant

intended to use Botox® on the patients completing the form when, in fact, STEPHEN LEE.

SELDON knew ke was going to inject his patients with TRitox.

DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON ordered and caused to be ordered thirty-cight (38) 500 1.U. vials
of TRItox between October 2003 and September 2004. STEPHEN LEE SELDON and DEBORAH
MARTINEZ SELDON paid $36,925 for a total of 19,000 units (38 vials @ 500 units per vial) of
TRitox, approximately half of what Allergan would have charged for an equivalent amount of
Botox®.

30. As part of the scheme and artifice, STEPHEN LEE SELDON and
DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON stopped purchasing Botox® from Allergan in October 2003,
the same month they began purchasing or causing to be purchased TRItox from TRI.

31. As part of the scheme and artifice, STEPHEN LEE SELDON spokc at a
seminar in Scottsdale, Arizona, in September 2004, sponsored by TRI, in which he promoted the use
of TRitox and claimed that he used it on patients in his practice, notwithstanding the warning on each
vial that TRI was for “Research purposes only, not for human usc.”

32. In late November, 2004, the national media publicized the hospitalization of
four individuals who had contracted botulism after recciving injections of a non-I‘DA approved

botulinum toxin at an unrelated medical clinic in Florida. Less than two months later, in January

‘ 2005, as part of the scheme and artifice, DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON arranged for a secret

purchase of, and received, 132 additional vials of TRItox for $50,000 for usc by STEPHEN LEE

. SELDON at A New You.

33. As part of the scheme and artifice, STEPHEN LEE SELDON and Deborah

Martinez Seldon failed to disclose to A New You’s patients that:

a, They were being injected with a different drug than Botox®;

b. The product they were being injected with was not approved by the
FDA; and

¢. They were being injected with a drug labeled “For research purposes

only, not for human use.”

deleting references to “Botox®.” and changing these entries to the
generic notation “Cosmetic Procedurc;”

DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON caused twenty-eight (2&) vials
of TRItox to be returned to the FDA. STEPHEN LEE SELDON and
DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON sought to create the misleading
impression that they were returning 28 vials of the original 33 v:als
purchased from TRI.. In fact, STEPHEN LEE SELDON and
DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON had used all of the orginal

TRItox on the patients at A New You, and were returning vials thal

were part of DEBORAH MARTINEZ SELDON’s secret purchase of

132 vials from TRI in January 2005.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Board of Medical Examiners of the state of Nevada,

composed of Charles N. Held, M.D., Chairman, and Jean Stoess, M.A., Member, by and through
Lyn E. Beggs, General Counsel for the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Stephen Seldon, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Dr. Seldon, has
violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the
Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Dr. Seldon is currently licensed in active status, and was so licensed by the Nevada
State Board of Medical Examiners, hereinafter referred to as “the Board,” pursuant to the provisions
of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, at the time of the incidents in question.

2. Patient A is the patient at issue and was a forty-eight year old female at the time of
the matter in question.

3. Patient A began to see Dr. Seldon in 2003 when she saw him for a cosmetic injection
of Restylane. Patient A continued to see Dr. Seldon over the course of the next four years for a
variety of cosmetic procedures including cosmetic injections, a combination face lift, a thread lift
and a lower blepheroplasty.

4, Medical records for these procedures are virtually non-existent and do not accurately

and completely document the treatment of Patient A.

5. In October 2007, Patient A opted to undergo a tumescent liposuction treatment on a


variety of areas, the majority of the liposuction to be performed in her abdominal area. On
October 9, 2007 she signed a variety of waivers and a consent form regarding liposuction.

6. On October 11, 2007, Patient A presented to Dr. Seldon’s office for the liposuction
procedure which was begun without the use of general anesthetic or deep sedation as is standard in
tumescent liposuction procedures.

7. The procedure was not completed as Patient A was apparently experiencing too much
pain to continue without anesthesia and accordingly the procedure was not completed.

8. Patient A also wrote a check to Dr. Seldon for $750 with the memo indicating it was
for “Dr. Singel, Anesthesiologist.” Dr. Singel is a podiatrist, not a medical doctor; however, there is
no indication that Patient A was ever made aware of this fact or that she gave an informed consent to
have him provide anesthesia during the procedure.

9. Patient A returned the following day, October 12, 2007 for performance of the
tumescent liposuction procedure and according to the minimal medical record, “twilight” anesthesia

was utilized.

10. The medical records for the procedure are minimal and are not accurate and
complete.
11. ‘Patient A was released from Dr. Seldon’s office and was provided a prescription for

Percocet. She was to return the following morning for a post-operative visit.

12. Patient A experienced pain and jitteriness during the night and early morning ‘hours
after the procedure and she took some of the prescribed Percocet to relieve her pain. The morning
of October 13, 2007, Patient A’s son phoned Dr. Seldon’s office indicating that he would not be
bringing in his mother as she was finally resting after a difficult night.

13, Later on October 13, 2007, Patient A’s son went to Dr. Seldon’s office to obtain a
different pain medication for her as it was felt that the Percocet may have caused some of her
jitteriness.

14. Patient A’s son contact Dr. Seldon’s office twice more on October 13, 2007, the last

time reporting that she was bleeding, including a large amount of blood being found in the toilet

15. | At no time on October 13, 2007 did Dr. Seldon personally speak with Patient A’s


son.

16. Patient A’s son and another family member eventually contacted emergency medical
services and she was transported via ambulance to St. Rose Dominican Hospital where she was seen
in the emergency room at approximately 7:00 p.m.

17. | Patient A was admitted to the ICU where her condition worsened. She coded and
although resuscitation efforts were made, she eventually died in. the early morming hours of
October 14, 2007.

18. An autopsy report was completed which noted the cause of death as multi-organ
failure due to acute microangiopathic hemolytic anemia due to tumescent liposuction procedure.
The autopsy report also noted at least thirty-five irregular and curvilinear puncture wounds on the
skin on the abdomen, upper legs and buttocks. The underlying soft tissue demonstrated broad areas
of hemorrhage and necrosis.

Count]

19. | NRS 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient, to
use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

20. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds for initiating disciplinary action
against a licensee.

21. Dr. Seldon failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under
similar circumstances when he performed liposuction on Patient A utilizing a high number of
incisions -which is below the standard of care, and accordingly Dr. Seldon has violated
NRS 630.301(4) and thus is subject to discipline.

Count I

22. Dr. Seldon failed to use the reasonable, care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances when he allowed a podiatrist to act as anesthesiologist during the
procedure and did not inform Patient A of the fact that the individual was a podiatrist nor gain her
informed consent for him to provide the anesthesia; accordingly, Dr. Seldon has violated

NRS 630.301(4) and thus he is subject to discipline.

hearing;
