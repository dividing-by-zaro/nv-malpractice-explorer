4. A CT scan was performed on June 29, 2001 showing a 2.0 cm round mass lesion in
the posteromedial left parietal lobe, which was suspected of being a meningioma.

5. Patient A was seen by Dr. Hammargren in June 2001. Dr. Hammargren referred
her to a radiation oncologist, Dr. Toy, for evaluation.

6. Dr. Toy found Patient A was a good candidate for surgical removal of the
meningioma and referred her for an MRI.

7. An MRI was completed on August 10, 2001, which showed a 2 cm by 1.6 cm
extra-axial mass originating from the posterior flax, most consistent with a meningioma.

8. Dr. Hammargren performed a craniotomy to remove the meningioma on February
21, 2002.

9. A postoperative pathology report dated February 23, 2002, noted that in the
specimen provided from Patient A’s surgery, that no meningioma was identified.

10. A second pathology report date February 25, 2002, was produced as a supplement
indicating that deeper levels were examined and no evidence of meningioma was seen.

11. Patient A had a post-operative MRI scan completed on June 20, 2002, which
showed a left parafalcine extra axial mass with little change in size with a maximum diameter near
2 centimeters and that this scan showed little change compared to the earlier MRI performed.

Count I

12. Nevada Administrative Code Section 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of
a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

13. Nevada Revised Statute Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds
for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

14. Dr. Hammargren failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily
used under similar circumstances when he failed remove Patient A’s meningioma during the
craniotomoy performed on February 21, 2002 and thus has violated NRS 630.301(4).

15. By reason of the foregoing, Dr. Hammargren is subject to discipline by the Nevada

State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.
