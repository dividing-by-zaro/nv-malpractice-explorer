Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is licensed in active status to practice medicine in the State of Nevada, and

2. Respondent was granted a license to practice medicine in the state of California on July

Respondent alleging among other things, gross negligence on the part of Respondent, in his care and
treatment of multiple patients.

3. Thereafter, on February 9, 2005, the state of California entered an Order revoking
Respondent’s license to practice medicine, however, that revocation was stayed, and Respondent was

placed on probation with various conditions for a period of five years beginning March 11, 2005.




4. Section 630.301(3) of the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that the suspension,
modification or limitation of the license to practice any type of medicine by any other jurisdiction is
grounds for disciplinary action.

5. The stayed revocation of Respondent’s license to practice medicine in the state of
California, constitute violations of the provisions of NRS 630.301(3).

6. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners fix a time and place for a formal
hearing;

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him, the time and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions against
him;

determines to impose for the violation or violations committed by Respondent; and

4. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Respondent its findings of facts, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions
imposed; and
