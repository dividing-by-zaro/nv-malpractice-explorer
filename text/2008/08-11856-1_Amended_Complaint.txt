AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Board of Medical Examiners of the state of Nevada,
composed of Sohail U. Anjum, M.D., Chairman, and S. Daniel McBride, M.D., by and through
Lyn E. Beggs, Deputy General Counsel for the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Navneet Sharda, M.D., hereinafter referred to as "Respondent," has
violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the
Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status, and was so licensed by the Nevada
State Board of Medical Examiners, hereinafter referred to as “the Board,” pursuant to the provisions of
Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, at the time of the incidents in question.

2. Patient A was a seventy-four year old female at the time of the matter in question. Her
true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A had a history of atrial fibrillation, which eventually resulted in the implantation
of a pacemaker in January of 2002.

4. During the workup of Patient A for the implantation of the pacemaker, her physician
noted a mass in the left breast, which was determined to be cancerous.

/It



5. Patient A underwent a double mastectomy in August 2002 and the pathology report
indicated poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma with focal invasion of overlying skin and
eleven left axillary lymph nodes demonstrated adenocarcinoma with perinodal extension.

6. Patient A was referred for a consultation with Respondent, which was performed on
August 23, 2002, at which time he recommended radiation therapy. Patient A was in distress at

Respondent’s office and was later diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism and hospitalized so the initial

| consultation was not completed.

7. Patient A returned to Respondent on September 12, 2002 at which time her consultation
was completed. In the medical records from this appointment, Respondent notes that Patient A did
have a pacemaker.

8. Patient A began radiation therapy on September 17, 2002, however, Respondent did not
fully investigate Patient A’s pacemaker prior to beginning radiation therapy.

9. Respondent also did not review diagnostic studies prior to the beginning of radiation nor
does he indicate in the medical records if he ever reviewed a bone scan and or a CT of the abdomen and
pelvis, which is noted to exist on October 9, 2002.

10. | Respondent did not have Patient A see a medical oncologist regarding the possibility of
chemotherapy prior to beginning radiation therapy.

11. Patient A completed her radiation on November 6, 2002, but continued to see
Respondent through 2003.

12. A biopsy performed on skin from Patient A’s right cheek on November 1, 2002 was
positive for cancer.

13. Patient A underwent radiation for skin cancer in 2003 and completed radiation therapy
on August 27, 2003.

14. Respondent’s medical records for Patient A are lacking in information and appear to be

lacking in information regarding treatment that Patient A received.



15. Patient B was a sixty-three year old female at the time of the incidents in question. Her
true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

16. Patient B presented to Respondent on January 26, 2004, for continued follow-up care.
Patient B had undergone a left mastectomy for cancer of the left breast six years prior and had been
taking Tamoxifen for five years and had recently switched to Femara prior to seeing Respondent.
Respondent performed a consultation and recommended that Patient B return in six months.

17. Patient B returned on July 9, 2004 reporting of lower back pain for which she had
undergone an MRI with showed moderate canal stenosis at the L3-L4 and L5 as well as some lumbar
vertebral marrow signal changes.

18. | Over the next several months, Patient Bunderwent several diagnostic studies including a
bone scan, CT scans and a PET scan and saw Respondent several times complaining of increasing pain.

19. On December 4, 2004, Patient B underwent a CT scan performed at UMC which,
indicated biapical pleural and parenchymal disease and some focal nodular thickening in the left apex
and a PET scan subsequently performed indicated some abnormal soft tissue in the lung apices with
abnormal hypermetabolic activity raising the question of carcinoma.

20. Patient B saw Respondent on March 10, 2005 at which time Respondent reviewed the
CT scan and the results of the PET scan and indicated that lung cancer was very likely.

21. The medical records indicate that Patient B’s husband indicated that a biopsy had not
been performed by UMC due to high-risk concerns.

22. Patient B and her husband agreed for her to undergo radiation treatment using high doses
of radiation and the IMRT modality instead of having rescans and the possibility of having thoracic
surgery for a biopsy if the rescans indicated growth.

23. Patient B completed radiation therapy using dynamic arc IMRT on May 11, 2005 and
according to Respondent, Patient B reported a significant reduction in pain towards the end of
treatment.

24. Patient B did see Respondent again on June 10, 2005 reporting continued modest

discomfort in the right supraclavicular area.



25. Patient B continued her care for her on-going pain with other providers.

26. Respondent’s medical records for Patient B do not appear to be complete and are lacking
information in regard to the radiation treatment that Patient B received and her continued complaints of
pain.
