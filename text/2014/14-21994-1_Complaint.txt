(Board), composed of Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., Bashir Chowdhry, M.D., and Sandy Peltyn, by
and through Erin L. Albright, Esq., General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a reasonable

4. During this ER visit, a computerized tomography scan of Patient A’s
abdomen/pelvis was performed and interpreted by a radiologist as “small right pleural effusion;
small amount of ascites; small cyst of the right kidney.”

5. During this ER visit, an abdominal ultrasound was performed and interpreted by a
radiologist as “small amount of ascites; right pleural effusion.”

6. During this ER visit, blood work showed Patient A’s total bilirubin was elevated at
2.0, with aminotransferase of 205, alanin aminotransferase of 337 and alkaline phosphatase of 66.
Patient A’s white blood cell count was 13.1 with normal differential and elevated hemoglobin of
15.4. Patient A had a decreased carbon dioxide level of 16 and a mildly elevated creatinine level
of 1.13.

7. On or about March 26, 2012, Patient A presented to the ER for the second day in a
row with twenty-four (24) hours of new onset peripheral edema, a mildly diminished pulse

oximetry, persistent tachycardia and a cough that has lasted for three (3) weeks.

8. During this ER visit, Patient A was cared for and treated by Respondent.

9. During this ER visit, Respondent reviewed the records from Patient A’s March 25,
2012 ER visit.

10. Given the known presence of pleural effusion, ascites and transaminitis, coupled

with laboratory evidence of renal insufficiency, Respondent should have considered congestive
heart failure as the possible etiology of Patient A’s symptoms.

11. The standard diagnostic evaluation for possible congestive heart failure is a chest
x-ray and electrocardiogram.

12. Patient A’s medical chart lacks any evidence demonstrating that Respondent
ordered Patient A undergo a chest x-ray during Patient A’s March 25, 2012 ER visit.

13. Patient A’s medical chart lacks any evidence demonstrating that Respondent

ordered Patient A undergo an electrocardiogram during Patient A’s March 25, 2012 ER visit.
