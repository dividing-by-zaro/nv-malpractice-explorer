Board located at 6010 S. Rainbow Boulevard, Building A, Suite 2, Las Vegas, Nevada 89118, on the
associated Complaint filed against David Lynn Packer, M.D. (Respondent), who was not present at the
Board meeting.

The members of the Board participating in the decision were: Beverly A. Neyland, M.D.,
Bashir Chowdhry, M.D., Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D., Sandy Peltyn, and
Ann Wilkinson. Colleen L. Platt, Esq., Deputy Attorney General, acted as legal counsel to the Board.

The Board, having received and read the Complaint and exhibits admitted in this matter, as well
as the Synopsis of Record prepared by the hearing officer who presided over the hearing and the
transcript of the hearing, proceeded to make a decision pursuant to the provisions of Nevada Revised
Statutes (NRS) Chapters 233B and 630.

The Board, after due consideration of the record, evidence and law, and being fully advised in

the premises, makes its FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ORDER in this

matter as follows:



FINDINGS OF FACT

I.

Respondent held a license to practice as a physician in the state of Nevada at all relevant times.
However, the Board summarily suspended Respondent’s license to practice medicine in the state of
Nevada on March 18, 2013, after reviewing evidence and information which demonstrated Respondent
may be suffering from a mental or physical disorder that gives rise to a reasonable question as to his
competence to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety to his patients.

IL.

On April 18, 2013, Respondent was served by the Investigative Committee (IC) with an Order
for Evaluation, setting an evaluation of Respondent for April 30, 2013, at 11:15 a.m., with
Melissa Piasecki, M.D., at 1135 Terminal Way, Suite 106, Reno, Nevada. Respondent failed to appear
at the evaluation as ordered by the IC.

Ii.

On June 10, 2013, the IC filed an Order Lifting Summary Suspension, as the time frame was
expired.

IV.

On June 11, 2013, the IC summarily suspended Respondent’s license to practice medicine in the
state of Nevada. On that same date, the IC filed a formal Complaint in this matter alleging violations of
NRS Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630.

V.

On July 23, 2013, a hearing was held before an appointed hearing officer on the allegations
contained within the Order of Summary Suspension. Respondent was properly noticed of the hearing
by certified mail and was not present or represented by counsel. The IC was represented by
Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., General Counsel for the Board and attorney for the IC.

VI.

On October 30, 2013, the IC ordered that Respondent’s license to practice medicine in the state

of Nevada remain suspended, with said suspension effective until the final resolution of the formal

Complaint filed against Respondent in Case No. 13-34036-1 or further order of the Board/IC.



VIL.

On August 26, 2014, a hearing was held before an appointed hearing officer on the allegations
contained in Counts I and II of the Complaint. Respondent was properly noticed of the hearing by
certified mail and was not present or represented by counsel. The IC was represented by
Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., General Counsel for the Board and attorney for the IC.

Vir.

After the hearing, the adjudicating members of the Board were provided the Complaint and
exhibits admitted in this matter, as well as the Synopsis of Record prepared by the hearing officer who
presided over the hearing and the transcript of the hearing.

IX.
To date, Respondent has failed to comply with the IC’s April 18, 2013 Order for Evaluation.
X.

The Board finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent’s failure to submit to the
ordered evaluation constitutes an admission of the charges against him pursuant to NRS 630.318(3).
Thus, the Board finds by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent violated
NRS 630.3065(2)(a), NRS 630.306(1) and NRS 630.306(13) by willfully failing to comply with an
evaluation ordered by the IC.

so construed.
