3. On September 13, 2010, Patient A, who was suffering from spina bifida and Chiari
malformation, underwent decompression surgery, which was performed by Respondent.

4. A post-surgical CT scan of Patient A revealed a significant area of low density at
the upper most spinal cord, C1-C2 level, which essentially crossed the entire area of the spinal
cord, suggesting a severe infarct. As a result, Patient A was found to be quadriplegic, with lower
cranial nerve dysfunction and ventilator dependency. Patient A’s circumstance’s did not improve,
and ultimately life support was removed, and she passed away on October 17, 2010.

5. It is now alleged by the IC that Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill
or knowledge ordinarily used in similar circumstances in his treatment of Patient A when he
transected the spinal cord of Patient A during the Chiari decompression surgical procedure.

6. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice, defined as the failure to use the
reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used in similar circumstances, is grounds for
initiating disciplinary action.

7. Based upon the foregoing, Respondent committed malpractice in the course of|
providing care and treatment to Patient A and is subject to discipline by the Board as provided in
NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an
Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine the sanctions it will impose if it finds Respondent
violated the Medical Practice Act;

4. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent, in writing, its findings of
fact, conclusions of law and order, which shall include the sanctions imposed; and
