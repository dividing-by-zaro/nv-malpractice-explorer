COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), composed at the time of filing of Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., Sue Lowden and
Bashir Chowdhry, M.D., by and through Bradley O. Van Ry, Board General Counsel and attorney

violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada
Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630, collectively the Medical Practice Act (MPA), hereby
issues its formal Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations, as follows:

4. Respondent evaluated Patient A and performed an upper endoscopy a few hours
after Patient A’s admission to the ER, on September 5, 2011, at 0141 hrs. The endoscopic
findings noted esophageal rings, a food bolus in the distal esophagus and a significant esophageal
tear at approximately 32-33 cm.

5. Significantly, the esophageal rings should have raised the suspicion of eosinophilic
esophagitis, which suspicion should have indicated to Respondent that Patient A was at an
increased risk of having an esophageal perforation.

6. Respondent dislodged the food bolus and discharged Patient A with instructions to
follow up in four weeks for further evaluation and to obtain biopsies from the esophagus.
Unfortunately, Respondent did not order any further diagnostic tests, such as chest imaging,
including an x-ray, MRI or CT scan.

7. On September 11, 2011, Patient A returned to the ER and an esophageal
perforation of 1 cm was found located at approximately 35 cm down the esophagus. This
esophageal perforation led to numerous complications, ongoing hospital stays and surgeries for

Patient A until November. 8, 2011.

Count
(Malpractice)
8. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.
SY, NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,

to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

10. | NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

11. | As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent's care
and treatment of Patient A shows a failure to use reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily
used under similar circumstances by, among other things, failing to address the possibility of the
esophageal perforation in the presence of a significant esophageal tear and esophageal rings

indicative of such a perforation.
