9. On or about October 10, 2011, Patient A underwent a computer tomography (CT)
scan at Mountain View Hospital. The CT scan showed a four (4)-centimeter mass on Patient A’s
liver. The CT scan report recommended the mass be further evaluated by Patient A’s primary care
physician, which was noted by Respondent in Patient A’s medical chart.

10. Patient A’s medical records lack any documentation and/or evidence demonstrating
that Respondent further evaluated the four (4)-centimeter mass on Patient A’s liver.
