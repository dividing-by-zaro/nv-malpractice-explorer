COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), composed at the time of filing of Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., Sue Lowden and Bashir
Chowdhry, M.D., by and through Erin L. Albright, Esq., General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Wesley Wilkinson Hall, M.D. (Respondent), violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its formal Complaint,
stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 2416), and has been
so licensed by the Board since September 3, 1969, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical
Practice Act.

2. Patient A was a thirty-nine (39)-year-old obese male with an acutely inflamed
gallbladder, with adherences of the common duct, at the time of the incident in question. His true
identity is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect his identity, but his identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served contemporaneously on Respondent with a copy of this Complaint.

Patient A’s common bile/hepatic duct instead of the cystic duct. Respondent failed to recognize
this injury during the procedure.

4. In performing the laparoscopic cholecystectomy on Patient A, Respondent failed to
utilize the Critical View approach, which allows surgeons to discover ductal abnormalities or
adherences of the common bile duct to the gallbladder. This approach would have allowed
Respondent to discover that Patient A’s acutely inflamed gallbladder had adherences of the
common duct.

5. Patient A’s medical records do not demonstrate that Respondent: utilized the
Critical View approach during the laparoscopic cholecystectomy; postoperatively diagnosed
and/or evaluated Patient A for a bile leak; postoperatively evaluated Patient A for a retained
common bile duct stone; postoperatively evaluated Patient A for pancreatitis; reviewed Patient
A’s vital signs; and/or ordered a complete blood count performed on Patient A.

6. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set

forth herein.
7. NRS. 630.3062(1) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate and

complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds for
initiating discipline against a licensee.

8. As demonstrated by, but not limited to the above-outlined facts, Respondent failed
to maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A when he failed to document that he: postoperatively diagnosed
and/or evaluated Patient A for a bile leak; postoperatively evaluated Patient A for a retained
common bile duct stone; postoperatively evaluated Patient A for pancreatitis; reviewed Patient
A’s vital signs; and ordered a complete blood count performed on Patient A.

9. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
