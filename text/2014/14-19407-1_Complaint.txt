August 14, 2013 appointment with Respondent.

5. Respondent identified Patient A’s trigger points, injected the xylocaine, and
completed the procedure as planned.

6. After the procedure was completed, Patient A requested additional trigger point
injections of xylocaine.

7. Respondent agreed to provide Patient A with additional trigger point injections of
xylocaine and left the treatment room to prepare the additional trigger point injections.

8. When Respondent returned to Patient A’s treatment room, Patient A questioned
Respondent about his injection drawing procedures from multi-dose vials.

needle, same syringe.” Respondent confirmed this was the procedure he used with the xylocaine
he was about to inject into Patient A’s trigger points.

10. Respondent and Patient A discussed safe injection practices. At the end of the
discussion, Patient A refused the additional trigger point injections of xylocaine.

11. | Respondent violated the standard of care when he used the same syringe to re-enter
a multi-dose vial, even if that vial was not to be used on subsequent patients.

12. Patient A’s medical records do not contain any reference to the procedure used by
Respondent when he prepared the additional trigger point injections of xylocaine.
