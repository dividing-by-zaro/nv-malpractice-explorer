Case No. 12-4879-1

FT LE 'B)
JUN - 3 2014

NEVADA STATE BOARD OF
MEDICAL EXAMINERS

In the Matter of Charges and
Complaint Against

JOHN JOSEPH DUDEK, JR., M.D.,

Respondent.

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board) composed, at the time filing was approved, of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D.,
Ms. Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., having a reasonable
basis to believe that John Joseph Dudek, Jr., M.D. (Respondent), has violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the IC's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
(License No. 3293), and was originally licensed by the Board on March 13, 1977, pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the NRS.

2. Respondent practices urology at 2020 Goldring Avenue, Suite 506, in Las Vegas,
Nevada.

3, Respondent rents space within his office to Riveka Frey, R.N., aka Reva Frey, who
owns and operates her independent business, “Facial Enhancements by Reva,” in the office space
rented from Respondent.

4. Respondent purportedly acts in the capacity as “medical director” for Ms. Frey’s

practice and is available if there is a medical issue that arises from Ms. Frey’s procedures.

However, Ms. Frey performs evaluations of the patients upon which she performs procedures and
determines the treatment to be provided, including which dangerous drug(s) to administer to
patients, independently from Respondent. Pursuant to NRS 454.213, as applied to this matter,
dangerous drugs may only be possessed and administered by a licensed practitioner, as defined by
NRS 454.00958, or they may be administered by a registered nurse at the direction of a prescribing
physician. Ms. Frey’s patients are not evaluated by Respondent nor are they prescribed dangerous
drugs by Respondent.

5. Respondent, until very recently, knowingly allowed Ms. Frey to order dangerous
drugs, including, but not limited to, Botox, Restylane, Juvederm and other dangerous drugs used
commonly in cosmetic procedures, through his account with various drug wholesalers. Ms. Frey
would indicate to Respondent’s office manager what drugs she wished to order and would pay for
them with her credit card. Respondent signed an acknowledgment for receipt of the drugs after
delivery of the drugs to his office and the drugs would be turned over to Ms. Frey. |

6. The dangerous drugs ordered by Ms. Frey and delivered to Respondent’s office
included Latisse, a drug that is to be dispensed only. Pursuant to NRS 454.215(3), a licensed
physician may only dispense a dangerous drug if authorized by the Nevada State Board of
Pharmacy in accordance with NRS 639.23505. Respondent does not, nor has he ever, held a
certificate of registration from the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy to dispense controlled
substances or dangerous drugs in the state of Nevada. Ms. Frey was not legally authorized to
dispense any dangerous drugs either.

7. On or about February 21, 2013, Respondent applied for, and subsequently received,
a dispensing license from the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy.

8. On May 9, 2013, Ms. Frey entered into an Agreement for Reprimand with the
Nevada State Board of Nursing. In that Agreement, Ms. Frey admitted that from approximately
April 2011 through March 9, 2012, she worked in Respondent’s office as a Licensed Professional
Nurse performing cosmetic procedures.

9. Ms. Frey further admitted that she failed to maintain and/or produce written

protocols for procedures that she performed as required by law.

10. Ms. Frey also admitted that Respondent denied having knowledge of orders placed
for injectable hyaluronic acid (Restylane) and other prescription medications used for the
procedures she performed. _

11. Ms. Frey further admitted that her conduct constituted a violation of NRS
632.320(1)(g), unprofessional conduct, a violation of NAC 632.890(2), practicing beyond scope of
practice, and a violation of NAC 632.890(27), for failing to perform nursing functions in a manner
consistent with established or customary standards.

12. Significantly, Respondent is not a trained dermatologist or plastic surgeon and has
little or no experience or training in cosmetic procedures, including the. performance of facial
cosmetic procedures, and therefore would not be qualified to have performed the evaluations or
make the diagnoses and treatment determinations for those patients that saw Ms. Frey in her
independent practice operating in Respondent’s office.

13. Patient A was a sixty-one (61)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

14. Patient A saw Ms. Frey for an injection of Botox, 20 units, on March 23, 2012.
The medical records do not include any history and/or physical, nor do the records accurately
depict Patient A’s current medical and/or physical condition. Furthermore, it appears from the
records that at no time did Respondent see, examine and/or treat Patient A.

15. Patient B was a thirty-six (36)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

16. Patient B saw Ms. Frey for an injection of Restylane, hyaluronic acid, on
March 20, 2012. Then, on March 22, 2012, Ms. Frey injected Patient B with 1 syringe of
Radiesse. The medical records do not include any history and/or physical, nor do the records
accurately depict Patient B’s current medical and/or physical condition. Furthermore, it appears
from the records that at no time did Respondent see, examine and/or treat Patient B.
