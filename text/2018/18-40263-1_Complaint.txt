Education (CME) requirements on his Alaska State Medical Board (Alaska Board) 2015-2016
Physician Biennial License Renewal application.

Surrender of his Medical License (Alaska Physician License No. MED S 7336) in lieu of

imposition of disciplinary sanctions, effective immediately,

| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., and Mr. M. Neil
