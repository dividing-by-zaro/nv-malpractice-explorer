OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


The Board, after due consideration of the record, evidence and law, and being fully

advised in the premises, makes its FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, AND

ORDER in this matter as follows:
FINDINGS OF FACT

I.

Respondent held a license to practice medicine in the State of Nevada issued by the Board
at all relevant times.

IL.

On October 23, 2015, the Investigative Committee filed the Complaint in this matter
alleging Respondent violated the Medical Practice Act, specifically, alleging a violation of
NRS 630.3062(1) by failing to maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete medical records
relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patients A through C. Respondent was duly served
with the Complaint by mail on October 27, 2015. Respondent did not file a formal answer.
Pursuant to NAC 630.460(4), the allegations of the Complaint are deemed generally denied if an
answer is not filed. An Order Scheduling Early Case Conference was mailed to Respondent’s
then-counsel on February 8, 2016, and the Early Case Conference was held on March 16, 2016,
with Robert Kilroy, Esq., appearing on behalf of the Board, and Carrie Parker, Esq., appearing on
behalf of the Respondent. In compliance with NAC 630.465, on March 21, 2016, the Order
Setting Pre-Hearing Conference and Hearing was filed with the Board and mailed to Respondent’s
then-counsel. A Prehearing Conference was held as ordered. On or about May 25, 2016, a
Stipulation and Order to Continue Hearing was filed with the Board. On August 9, 2016, an
Order Rescheduling Hearing was filed with the Board, setting the hearing for September 28, 2016.
On September 28, 2016, the Hearing Officer entered an Order to Continue Hearing Date to
October 21, 2016. On December 28, 2016, the Hearing Officer entered an Order Scheduling
Additional Hearing Dates for February 17, 2017, and February 24, 2017.

On September 29, 2016, the Hearing Officer’s Recommendation to the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners Regarding Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss and the Investigative

Committee’s Motion to Strike was filed.

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


The hearing was held on October 21, 2016, February 17, 2017, and February 24, 2017, as
noticed and ordered. Colleen Platt, Esq., appeared as counsel for the Respondent, and Jasmine
Mehta, Esq., Deputy General Counsel, and Robert Kilroy, Esq., General Counsel, appeared on
behalf of the Investigative Committee of the Board. Respondent was present in person or via
video teleconference for all of the hearing except for the morning of February 24, 2017.

On November 6, 2017, Respondent was provided the Investigative Committee’s
Memorandum of Costs and Disbursements and Attorneys’ Fees by hand-delivery to Respondent’s
counsel.

Il.

The Board unanimously adopted the Hearing Officer’s Synopsis of the Hearing and the
Recommendations therein.

IV.

The Complaint alleges one violation of NRS 630.3062(1) for failure to maintain timely,
legible, accurate and complete medical records relating to Respondent’s treatment of Patients A

through C.
V.

The true identities of Patients A, B and C are not disclosed herein to protect their privacy,
but were disclosed in the Patient Designation that was served upon Respondent along with a copy

of the Complaint.
VI.

Respondent’s medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patients A
through C are not accurate, legible, timely or complete.
VII.
Many of the medical records lacked sufficient information to show how or why Dr.
Gabroy arrived at the treatment plan that he did. In many cases, it was unclear what medical
diagnoses the medications prescribed by Dr. Gabroy were intended to treat. Dosing information

was missing or illegible as well, all of which demonstrates that the records were not accurate or

complete.

VIII.

The medical records had handwritten dates on them, many of which were crossed out with
a new date or dates entered beneath the crossed out dates, such that it cannot be determined when
services were rendered, demonstrating that the records were not maintained in a timely, accurate
or complete manner.

IX.

Significant portions of the medical records at issue could not be read by witnesses for
either the Respondent or the Investigative Committee because Respondent’s handwriting was not
legible. Dr. Lynda Molloy, the expert witness for the Investigative Committee, testified that Dr.
Gabroy’s records were the least legible records she had ever seen. Synopsis at 17, ll. 9-11. All of
the adjudicating Board members who commented on the record expressed concern about the
illegibility of the medical records and the impact on the ability of medical care providers other
than Respondent to provide care based on the illegibility of the records.

X.

At the hearing, Respondent introduced new medical records for the same time periods and
same patients of the records at issue. These new records were not produced in response to the
Investigative Committee’s allegation letter and request to Respondent for his medical records, and
they differ substantially from those previously produced by Dr. Gabroy. In some instances, there
were two or even three medical records for the same patient on the same date, each different from
the other. Synopsis at 81, ll. 19-28; 82, Il. 1-7. The expert witness for the Investigative
Committee, as well as Dr. Leo Spaccavento, on behalf of the Respondent, both testified that they
did not understand why there would be multiple different medical records for the same patient for
the same date, and that this is unusual in their experience. Synopsis at 81, Il. 24-28. Even
Respondent’s own medical assistant, Ms. Ruby Casillen, could not explain why there were
multiple different records for the same patient on the same day (Synopsis at 82, Il. 1-7), and she
could not determine which set of records was to be relied on as a medical record. Synopsis at 54,
ll. 11-28, 24-26. The existence of multiple different medical records for the same patient for the

same date demonstrates that the medical records at issue were not accurate or complete.

XI.

Some medical records were written on a form with a border with rounded corners, while
other records for the same patient on the same date were written on a form that was distinct, with a
border with sharp corners and different pre-printed words on the form. The number of different
medical records bearing the same date for the same patient, but differing in other aspects,
including the form of the record, demonstrates that the latter produced records were created or
recreated many months or years after the patient encounters at issue, further demonstrating that the
Respondent did not maintain timely, accurate or complete records. Synopsis at 84, Il. 5-21.

XII.

Respondent’s witness, Ms. Ruby Casillen, a medical assistant working for Respondent,
testified that Respondent had asked her to rewrite the medical records, but she could not recall
when he had asked her to do so. Synopsis at 54, Il. 2-11; 55, Il. 2-10; 55, Il. 11-15, 21-26; 56, Il.
12-17. Respondent himself testified that he rewrote his records, but could not recall when he did
so. Synopsis at 83, Il. 20-26. Records were rewritten without following the proper procedure for
marking the changes as an amendment or an addendum. Synopsis at 82, Il. 15-17; 83, Il. 20-26.
The Board agrees with the Hearing Officer’s statement that it is reasonable to conclude that the
documents that Respondent provided during the hearing, and not previously exchanged with the
Investigative Committee, were created well after they were written, demonstrating that these
records were not timely. Synopsis at 84, II. 16-20.

XIII.

Based on any one or all of the aforementioned findings, the Board finds by a
preponderance of the evidence that Respondent violated NRS 630.3062(1) as alleged in the
Complaint, as Respondent failed to maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete medical
records related to the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patients A through C.

XIV.

The Board has reviewed Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss the Complaint and the
opposition and reply associated therewith, the Investigative Committee’s Motion to Strike and the
opposition and reply associated therewith, and the Hearing Officer’s Recommendations to the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners Regarding Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss and the
Investigative Committee’s Motion to Strike. At the adjudication, the Board voted to deny both
motions.

XV.

The Board has reviewed the Investigative Committee’s Memorandum of Costs and
Disbursements and Attorneys’ Fees, and the Board finds them to be the actual fees and costs
incurred by the Board as part of its investigative, administrative and disciplinary proceedings
against Respondent, and finds them to be reasonable based on: (1) the abilities, training,
education, experience, professional standing and skill demonstrated by Board staff and attorneys;
(2) the character of the work done, its difficulty, its intricacy, its importance, the time and skill
required, the responsibility imposed and the prominence and character of the parties where, as in
this case, they affected the importance of the litigation; (3) the work actually performed by
Board’s attorneys and staff, and the skill, time and attention given to that work, and; (4) the
product of the work and benefits to the Board and the people of Nevada that were derived
therefrom.

XVI.

Additionally, counsel for the Investigative Committee conceded that it was appropriate to
remove the attorney fees incurred for responding to Respondent’s public record requests, and
since the tasks had been block-billed rather than itemized, counsel for the IC recommended
reducing the fees for each entry in which it appeared that some of the work was attributed to
responding to public record requests, for a total of $1,746.20. The Board finds that it is reasonable
to reduce the attorneys’ fees by $1,746.20.

XVII.
If any of the foregoing Findings of Fact is more properly deemed a Conclusion of Law, it

may be so construed.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

I.

The Board has jurisdiction over Respondent and the Complaint, and an adjudication of this

matter by the Board members as set forth herein is proper.
IL.

Respondent was timely and properly served with the Complaint, and all notices and orders
in advance of the hearing and adjudication thereon, in accord with NRS and NAC Chapters 630,
NRS Chapter 233B, and the requirements of due process.

Hl.

NRS 630.3062(1) provides that failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete
medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient constitutes grounds for
initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

IV.

The Board concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that Respondent has violated

NRS 630.3062(1), as described above and as alleged in the Complaint and, accordingly, is subject

to discipline pursuant to NRS 630.352.
V.
The Board finds that, pursuant to NRS 622.400, it may recover from Respondent
reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the Board as part of its investigative,
administrative and disciplinary proceedings against Respondent as it hereby enters this Final

Order finding that Respondent has violated the Medical Practice Act, which the Board has the

authority to enforce.

VI.
If any of the foregoing Conclusions of Law is more properly deemed a Finding of Fact, it

may be so construed.
