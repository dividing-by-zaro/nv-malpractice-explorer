COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Crispino Santos Santos, M.D.
(Respondent), a physician licensed in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical
Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

L. Respondent is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Nevada
(License No. 8198). He has been continuously licensed by the Board since June 9, 1997.
A. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient A

2. Patient A was a 52-year-old female when she presented to Respondent for medical }
care on or about June 4, 2013. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her
privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of
this Complaint.

3. On or about June 4, 2013, Patient A presented to Respondent for a routine refill of

her intrathecal pain pump.

| The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), at the time this formal
Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chairman, Theodore
B. Berndt, M.D., and Mr. M. Neil Duxbury.

4. Respondent electronically interrogated Patient A’s intrathecal pump computer,
which showed the pump reservoir had 6.3 cubic centimeters (cc’s) of medication volume
remaining.

5. Respondent inserted a needle into Patient A’s subcutaneous pump tissue pocket,
rather than into the pump injection port.

6. Respondent then attempted to aspirate the medication in the pump, but noted that
he aspirated only 2 cc’s of medication volume, rather than 6.3 cc’s; this descrepency should have
provided further indication to a reasonable practitioner under the circumstances that Respondent
had not positioned the needle correctly in the injection port.

7. Respondent proceeded to inject intrathecal pain medication directly into the
subcutaneous tissue pocket, rather than into the pump injection port, causing Patient A to suffer a
drug overdose and a stroke, with resulting neurological deficits, paralysis and a speech disorder.

8. Immediately after Respondent injected intrathecal pain medication directly into
Patient A’s body, Patient A began to suffer slurred speech and hypotension, and became
incoherent.

9. Respondent did not call 9-1-1 or otherwise alert emergency medical services.
Instead, he instructed one of his medical assistants to “wheel her down to the emergency room of
Centenial Hills Hospital.”

10. | Respondent did not remain with Patient A; he did not accompany her to or attend to
her at the emergency room; he did not contact emergency room staff and inform them of Patient
A’s condition; he did not support her airway, or monitor her blood pressure and vital signs; he did
not administer a reversing agent, such as Narcan; Respondent was, or should have been, able and
equipped to perform all the aforementioned countermeasures as a practitioner undertaking to
support and care for intrathecal pain pump patients.

11. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set
