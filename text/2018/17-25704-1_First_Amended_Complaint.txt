By:

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board) hereby issues this First Amended Complaint (Complaint) against Robert G. Rand, M.D.
(Respondent). After investigating this matter, the IC has a reasonable basis to believe that
Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada
Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act). The IC alleges
the following facts:

1, Respondent was licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical
Practice Act, on July 1, 2005. His license (License No. 11470) expired June 30, 2017. Pursuant
to NRS 630.298, the expiration of a license by operation of law does not deprive the Board of
jurisdiction to proceed with any disciplinary proceeding against the licensee. At all relevant times
alleged herein, Respondent was licensed in an active status by the Board pursuant to the
provisions of the Medical Practice Act.

2. Pursuant to NRS 630.301(1), conviction of a felony relating to the practice of
medicine or the ability to practice medicine is grounds for initiating disciplinary action or denying
licensure.


| The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this First
Amended Complaint was approved, was composed of Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D., Ms. Sandy Peltyn, and Victor M.
