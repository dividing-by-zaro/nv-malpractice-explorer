COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against [van Lee Goldsmith, M.D. (Respondent), a
physician licensed in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a reasonable basis to

alleges the following facts:

A. Respondent’s Violations of Nevada Prescribing Laws, and the Nevada State Board of

1. Respondent is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Nevada
(License No. 6116). He has been continuously licensed by the Board since August 25, 1990.

this Section A.

3, On Wednesday, September 5, 2018, in Reno, Nevada, the Pharmacy Board held a

Pharmacy Board, dated September 13, 2018 (Pharmacy Board Order), the Pharmacy Board made

formal findings of fact, inter alia, as follows:

a.

On December 9, 2013, the Pharmacy Board granted Respondent an account for
Internet access to the Nevada Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) for purposes
authorized under federal and state law.

Before receiving access, Respondent signed a Practitioner Certification Statement
on December 6, 2013, stating that he understood and agreed under penalty of
perjury that he was responsible for all patient information transmitted from his
account, that he would treat PMP information as confidential, that he would protect
any PMP information in his possession or contro! in accordance with federal and
state laws governing health care information, and that he would safeguard his
password and not share his login credentials with any other person.

Stephen Paddock (Paddock) was the perpetrator of the October 1, 2017, Las Vegas
mass shooting, and committed suicide immediately after the incident, sometime
before midnight.

On or about October 2, 2017, Respondent verified through his office electronic
medical records system (EMR) that Paddock was never his patient.

From October 2, 2017, at 9:25 a.m., to October 3, 2017, at 2:20 p.m., Respondent’s
PMP account was used to query the PMP database five separate times using
different search parameters for each query, to access Paddock’s confidential patient
information, and to obtain patient utilization reports detailing Paddock’s
prescription-controlled substance utilization history.

The fourth search, conducted on October 3, 2017, at 10:18 a.m., yielded specific
prescription information regarding two prescriptions for Paddock filled at
Evergreen Drugs in Henderson, Nevada in 2016, and at a Walgreens pharmacy in
Reno, Nevada, in 2017.

On October 3, 2017 at 9:00 p.m., the Las Vegas Review-Journal published an

article written by reporter Paul Harasim. That article purported to include


OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners

9600 Gateway Drive

Reno, Nevada 89521

(775) 688-2559


4.

Paddock’s confidential patient information, including information about the two
prescriptions, which the reporter attributed to and obtained from the PMP.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal updated the article on October 4, 2017, at 10:00
a.m., to reference specific prescription data and prescriber information related to
Paddock from June 7, 2016, and June 21, 2017.

Respondent’s PMP account is the only possible source for the details in the Las
Vegas Review-Journal article that are attributed to the PMP, because only the
fourth search from his PMP account corresponds to the dates and time frames
specified in the article.

On or about November 8, 2017, Respondent, through his counsel, Jacob L. Hafter,
Esq., filed an Amended Declaration with the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark
County, Nevada, in Case No. A-17-762877-W, in which Respondent admits to
directing his office staff to use his PMP account to query Paddock’s confidential
patient information and to obtain patient utilization reports on October 2, 2017, and
again on October 3, 2017.

In his Amended Declaration, Respondent also admits to routinely allowing his staff
to use his PMP account to query the PMP on his behalf.

Pursuant to the Pharmacy Board Order, the Pharmacy Board made conclusions of

law, inter alia, as follows:

a.

By accessing or directing his staff to access Paddock’s confidential data in the PMP
database, when Paddock was deceased and never his patient, and by obtaining
Paddock’s patient utilization report, Respondent performed his duties as the holder
of a Nevada Controlled Substance Registration in an incompetent, unskillful or
negligent manner and engaged in unprofessional conduct or conduct contrary to the
public interest pursuant to NAC 639.945(1)(i). Respondent’s Controlled Substance
Registration, Certificate of Registration No. CS20816, and Practitioner Dispensing
Registration, Certificate No. PD00413, are therefore subject to discipline pursuant
to NRS 639.210(4) and NRS 639.255.


OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL

(775) 688-2559





b. By accessing or directing his staff to access Paddock’s confidential data in the PMP

database, when Paddock was deceased and never his patient, and by obtaining
Paddock’s patient utilization report, Respondent violated the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
His Controlled Substance Registration, Certificate of Registration No. CS20816,
and Practitioner Dispensing Registration, Certificate No. PD00413, are therefore
subject to discipline pursuant to NRS 639.210(11) and NRS 639.255.

By accessing or directing his staff to access Paddock’s confidential data in the PMP
database, when Paddock was deceased and never his patient, and by obtaining
Paddock’s patient utilization report, Respondent violated, attempted to violate,
assisted or abetted in the violation of, or conspired to violate NRS 453.164(7)
and/or the HIPAA Privacy Rule. His Controlled Substance Registration, Certificate
of Registration No. CS20816, and Practitioner Dispensing Registration, Certificate
No. PD00413, are therefore subject to discipline pursuant to NRS 639.210(12) and
NRS 639.255.

. By disclosing, or allowing to be disclosed, to the Las Vegas Review-Journal and/or

writer Paul Harasim Paddock’s confidential PMP data and patient utilization report,
which were accessed only by Respondent’s PMP account on October 2 and
October 3, 2017, Respondent violated state and federal law, including the HIPAA
Privacy Rule and NRS 639.164(7). His Controlled Substance Registration,
Certificate of Registration No. CS20816, and Practitioner Dispensing Registration,
Certificate No. PD00413, are therefore subject to discipline pursuant to NRS
639.210(4), (11) and (12) as well as NRS 639.255.

By accessing or directing his staff to access Paddock’s confidential data in the PMP
database, when Paddock was deceased and never his patient, and by obtaining
Paddock’s patient utilization report, Respondent committed an act that would
render his Nevada Controlled Substance Registration inconsistent with the public
interest pursuant to NRS 453.231, and is subject to discipline pursuant to NRS
453.236(1)(d) and NRS 453.241(1).
