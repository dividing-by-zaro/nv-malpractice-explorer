4. NRS 630.3062(1) provides that the failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate and
complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds for
initiating discipline against a licensee.

5. Respondent failed to maintain complete medical records relating to the diagnosis,
treatment and care of Patient A when, on information and belief, Respondent converted his
medical practice to an Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system, during which conversion
certain handwritten medical records pertaining to Patient A’s treatment were misplaced and not
loaded onto the EMR system, and were ultimately lost.

6. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1 ‘That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in NRS 630.339(2) within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2 That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a
formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions to
impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act
committed by Respondent;

4. ‘That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners make, issue and serve on
Respondent its findings of fact, conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the
sanctions imposed; and

5. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners take such other and further
action as may be just and proper in these premises.
