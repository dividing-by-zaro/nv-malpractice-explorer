By:
COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Robert Watson, M.D. (Respondent), a
physician licensed in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a reasonable basis to
believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and
Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act). The IC
alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent’s license, No. 9076, active since July 12, 1999, was issued pursuant to
the Medical Practice Act.

2. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On June 26, 2013, Patient A, who was a 56-year-old female, presented to Renown
Emergency Room (ER) complaining of abdominal pain. The ER evaluation included a CT scan of
her abdomen, which revealed a small bowel obstruction (SBO) with multiple dilated loops of |
bowel with multiple air fluid levels consistent with a mechanical SBO. A general surgery consult
was requested with white blood cell (WBC) count of 12,200.

4. Between June 27, 2013, thru June 29, 2013, her laboratory results indicated an

increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit. Additionally, Patient A indicated having a 7/10 to 8/10

' The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), at the time this formal
‘Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D., Ms. Sandy

pain scale, for which narcotics were prescribed and administered.

5. On June 28, 2013, Patient A reported to her nurse that she was having bad pain that
evening. Subsequently, following the administration of additional pain medicine, Patient A went
to have another CT scan (2 CT Scan), which was ordered and was available to Respondent when
he encountered Patient A at 0948 on June 29, 2013.

6. On June 29, 2013, the notes at 0800 indicate Patient's A increasing pain, which
required an additional increase in narcotics (dilaudid & morphine every 4 hours) and she
subsequently become drowsy. At 0948, the results of the 2" CT Scan revealed progression of the
SBO with marked inflammation of the pelvic bowel segment, which progressed into loop fluid
ascites and mesenteric edema, and these results were available to be reviewed by Respondent, but.
he did not review such at that time.

7. On June 29, 2013, the notes at 1500 indicated Respondent’s first encounter with
Patient A and his notes reflect that she was clinically stable and scheduled for surgery the
following morning.

8. On June 29, 2013, the notes at 1700 indicate the continued use of the previously
prescribed pain medications.

%. Between the late night of June 29, 2013, and the morning of June 30, 2013, Patient
A’s condition deteriorated to such a state that she had to be transferred to the ICU (Intensive Care
Unit) with aggressive resuscitation measures implemented. At this time, Respondent was notified
and he decided to proceed to perform surgery upon the patient the next day. Respondent did not
note or acknowledge the increased pain medications nor did he review the 2" CT Scan according
to his medical charts. Respondent believed there was no need to proceed to surgery on the 29" of
June, despite having Patient A’s medications increased for pain and a SBO and having this 2 CT
Scan show the progression of the SBO with marked inflammation of edematous pelvic bowel
segment with progressed interloop fluid, along with the radiologist also stating “ischemia within
the small bowel loop cannot be excluded.” Respondent opted to schedule surgery for the next day
despite the aforementioned medical information.

10. On June 30, 2013, Patient A required bowel resection for ischemic bowel and later
developed respiratory failure, sepsis, and renal failure. Patient A’s serum lactate level, at 0504,
was at an elevated 3.01 level when she was transferred into the ICU.
