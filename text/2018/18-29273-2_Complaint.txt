MEDJEAL EXAMINERS
By:

COMPLAINT.
The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)

hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Karen Rae Abbott, M.D. (Respondent), a
physician licensed in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a reasonable basis to
believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and
Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act). The IC
alleges the following facts:

1, Respondent was licensed (License No. 11149) in Nevada by the Board on September
10, 2004, and with scopes of practice listed as gynecology, infertility and urology.

2. Patient A was a 42-year-old female at the time of the events and her true identity is
not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but her identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with this Complaint.

3. On June 9, 2014, Patient A first presented to Respondent’s office complaining of|
heavy menses and pelvic pain. The medical records for this initial visit do not include the
patient’s name or vital signs.

4. Patient A’s medical history included two prior cesarean sections, a
cholecystectomy, an appendectomy, obesity, and lysis of intra-abdominal adhesions.

5. Patient A presented for follow-up appointments for her medical issues on June 17,

‘The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board), at the time this formal
‘Complaint was authorized for filing, was composed of Board members Rachakonda D. Prabhu, M.D., Ms. Sandy
Peltyn and Victor M. Muro, M.D.

2014, July 14, 2014, July 30, 2014 and August 13, 2014. Patient A received a local anesthetic
injection in her abdomen to relieve pelvic pain at some of those follow-up appointments. With
regards to said follow-up appointments, medical records indicate very little documentation of
Patient A’s complaints, vital signs, assessment and treatment plan.

6. OnNovember 3, 2014, Patient A presented for a pre-operation appointment.

7. On November 7, 2014, Patient A underwent an operative laparoscopy with a right
ovarian cystectomy and lysis of the anterior abdominal wall adhesion and enterolysis followed by
a diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy with a hydrothermal ablation. This procedure was
performed as outpatient at Renown Regional Medical Center.

8. On the following day, November 8, 2014, Patient A was seen in the Emergency
Room at Banner Medical Center; her exam and vital signs were normal and she was discharged.

9 On November 10, 2014, and then on November 17, 2014, Patient A presented to
Respondent's office for postoperative appointments, and an exam determined that Patient A’s vital
signs were appropriate for her postoperative state.

10. | On November 22, 2014, Patient A was brought to Renown Regional Medical
Center and she was unconscious. It was determined that Patient A was suffering from septic
shock due to bowel perforations (likely caused during her November 7, 2014 surgery). General
surgery and internists treated her.

11. November 22, 2014, began a month-long complicated hospital stay that included
multiple surgeries, blood transfusions, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and treatment for sepsis
induced encephalopathy. After approximately a month, Patient A was discharged and survived.

12, The medical records do not indicate any workup of this patient’s symptoms or the
possible etiologies of her pains, or possible treatment options. The only treatment was to list the
surgery to be performed, which lacks any medical justification provided for by the Respondent in
the medical records.

13. The IC reviewed the findings from an Independent Medical Expert (IME), who
reviewed the medical records and additional relevant documentation and opined that Respondent's

acts and/or omissions violated the Medical Practice Act.
