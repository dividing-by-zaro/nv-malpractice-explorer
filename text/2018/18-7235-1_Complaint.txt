COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Luke St. John Cesaretti, M.D.
(Respondent), a physician licensed in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical
Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

l. Respondent is licensed in Nevada in active status (License No. 6238) and was
licensed by the Board on June 8, 1991.

2. Patient A was a forty-eight (48)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but her
identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with this

Complaint.

3: On or about October 18, 2012, Patient A presented for an MRI of the thoracic
spine. Respondent examined the MRI, but failed to identify an existence of a high signal mass in
this patient’s chest and subsequently failed to indicate this mass in her health care records. This
aforementioned mass in Patient A’s chest was shown on the sagittal images of the MRI.

4, On September 30, 2014, Patient A was deceased.

| At the time of this formal complaint was authorized to file, the IC was composed of Board members Rachakonda D.
Prabhu, M.D., Chairman, Victor M. Muro, M.D. and Ms. Sandy Peltyn, public member.
