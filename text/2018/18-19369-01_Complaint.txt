COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this Complaint (Complaint) against Christopher Seung Choi, M.D. (Respondent), a
licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC! has a reasonable basis to
believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and
the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively Medical Practice Act). The IC
alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent was licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical
Practice Act, on September 15, 2000, and is currently licensed in active status (License No. 9589).

2. Patient A was a 90-year-old female at the time of the incidents in question. Her
name is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with a copy of this Complaint.

a At the time of the events in question, Patient A was a resident of a nursing home in
Las Vegas, Nevada and suffered from dementia, among other conditions. Dr. Choi was employed

by or contracted with the nursing home and treated patients there, including Patient A.

'The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time of filing of this Complaint
‘was approved, was composed of Board members Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chairman, Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, and Aury

Nagy, M.D.

4. On October 7, 2014, Patient A underwent a procedure for installation of a
pacemaker outside of the nursing home with no apparent complications at that time.

5. On October 20, 2014, Patient A complained of pain in her left hip and staff}
reported a popping noise from the hip area upon movement of left leg. Respondent ordered an x-
ray, which showed no fracture or acute dislocation.

6. On October 21, 2014, nursing staff noted that Patient A’s left foot was cool to the
touch and exhibited skin color changes.

7. On October 21, 2014, a venous duplex ultrasound was performed. It revealed no
evidence of a deep vein thrombosis. However, on the same date, an arterial duplex ultrasound
revealed “no flow present” in Patient A’s left proximal superficial femoral artery, left popliteal
artery, left anterior and posterior tibial artery, and left dorsalis pedis artery. The report stated that
there was “severe mild atherosclerotic plaquing in the left lower extremity with no detectable flow
beyond the distal thigh.” Further revaluation with a computed tomography (CT) angiogram was
recommended. The results were faxed to Respondent on October 21, 2014.

7. Respondent did not order a CT angiogram and did not physically examine Patient
A’s left leg below the hip, in spite of nursing notes that Patient’s left leg was cool to the touch and
exhibited skin color changes and in spite of Patient A continuing to experience pain in her left
leg. Respondent merely treated Patient A for pain.

8. Respondent did not approve sending Patient A to the emergency department.
Patient A’s daughter authorized nursing staff to call an ambulance to take Patient A to the
‘emergency department on October 29, 2014, which was done that day, over a week after Patient
A’s symptoms first appeared.

a: On October 29, 2014, Patient A underwent an ultrasound of her lower left leg and
an emergency angiograph, which showed total occlusion of the left limb aortic stent graft, left
common iliac, external iliac and common femoral arteries. The attending surgeon’s initial
assessment was that the leg would have to be amputated either above or below the knee.

10. On October 30, 2014, Patient A was taken to surgery for a bilateral, common

femoral endarterectomy, left profunda femoral endarterectomy, and a right femoral to left femoral

under similar circumstances, including but not limited to the conduct described herein, when he

provided in NRS 630.352.

CT angiogram, approved transport of Patient A to the emergency department, or took other
actions to diagnose and/or treat Patient A’s left leg pain on or after October 20, 2014, Respondent
