AMENDED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND ORDER

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Robert Kilroy, Esq., General Counsel for the Board and IC, and
Poupak P. Ziaei, M.D. (Respondent), formerly a licensed medical doctor in Nevada, represented
by Monte Neil Stewart, Esq., of Wright Stanish & Winckler, hereby enter into this Amended
Settlement Agreement (Amendment) based on the following:!

A. Background

I. The IC and the Respondent entered into the original Settlement Agreement

Agreement, as approved, was filed on December 4, 2017.

per month will be due on the first day of the month beginning on January 1, 2018 through

June 1, 2018. The remaining payment will be due in monthly installments of $1,000.00

commencing on July 1, 2018 and the first day of each month thereafter, until satisfied in

full.”

3, Respondent entered into Paragraph 5.b with the desire and in the good faith belief
that she could accomplish the necessary endeavors to return to practice as a licensed Nevada
physician before June 1, 2018, and, on that basis, that she could begin paying $1,000.00 a month
on that date in compliance with the terms of Paragraph 5.b.

4. In material part because of lack of funds needed to accomplish the necessary
relicensing endeavors (licensing application fee, educational course to prepare for the Internal
Medicine Board Exam, fee for that exam, etc.), Respondent was not able to meet her June 1, 2018
goal.

5. Respondent is now planning to take the Internal Medicine Board Exam in October
2018 and believes that she can accomplish all necessary relicensing endeavors before January 1,
2019 and therefore believes that she will be able financially to begin making the monthly
$1,000.00 payments on that date.

6. Respondent has continued to make timely the $100.00 monthly payments that she
began making January 1, 2018. She will continue to do so until she begins making the $1,000.00
monthly payments.

7. To date, Respondent has paid a total of $1,800.00 towards her total payment
obligation of $14,290.16.

8. Accordingly, Paragraph 5.b of the Agreement is amended to read:

“b. | Respondent will pay the costs and expenses incurred in the investigation and

prosecution of the above-referenced matter, the current amount being $14,290.16, not

including any costs that may be necessary to finalize this Agreement. Payment of
$1,000.00 will be due within seven (7) calendar days of the Board’s approval of this

Agreement. Based on Respondent’s current financial circumstances, payment of $100.00

per month will be due on the first day of the month beginning on January 1, 2018 through
