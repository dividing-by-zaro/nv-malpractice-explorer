COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this formal Complaint (Complaint) against Craig Mitchell Weingrow, M.D.
(Respondent), a physician licensed in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC has a
reasonable basis to believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical
Practice Act). The IC alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Nevada
(License No. 14309). He has been continuously licensed by the Board since April 5, 2012.
A. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient A

2. Patient A was a 36-year-old female at the time she established care with
Respondent. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is
disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint
(Patient Designation).

3, Respondent treated Patient A from October 15, 2014, through August 11, 2017.
Respondent saw Patient A approximately 42 times during this period, during which Respondent
prescribed controlled substances to Patient A, including but not limited to: Oxycodone and

Acetaminophen, 5/325 mg and 10/325 mg tablets; Dextroamphetamine-amphetamine, 30 mg

Acetaminophen, 10/325 mg tablets; Carisprodol, 325 mg tablets; Diazapam, 5 mg tablets;
Lorazepam, 0.5 mg tablets; Oxandrolone, 10 mg tablets; Guaitussin AC.

4. Respondent prescribed opioid analgesics to Patient A at higher than indicated
starting dosages for various patient complaints, without establishing diagnoses through a history,
physical exam or appropriate studies. Respondent continued to prescribe opioids to Patient A,
which were incrementally increased without exploring other non-controlled substances and
therapy alternatives. Pathological and possible life-threatening etiologies were not explored by
Respondent.

5. Respondent prescribed anabolic steriods to Patient A without establishing
diagnoses through a proper history, physical exam or appropriate studies, such as labs or imaging,
to confirm and establish diagnosis related to the loss of muscle mass complained of. Respondent
prescribed anabolic steroids, a pregnancy “Class X” (contraindicated) medication, to a female of
child-bearing age without establishing or documenting risks of pregnancy or of breast cancer.
Oxandralone has a “black-box” warning for peliosis hepatitis, which can lead to liver failure;
Respondent did not perform appropriate studies of liver function and follow-up, and education on
the risks of the medication were not offered.

6. Respondent prescribed benzodiazapines to Patient A at higher than indicated
starting dosages for various patient complaints without establishing diagnoses through a proper
history, physical and psychological exams or appropriate studies. Alternatives, such as non-
controlled substances or psychological therapy, were not explored by Respondent. Respondent
changed, increased and decreased benzodiazapine prescriptions and dosages for Patient A without
further evaluation or explanation. Risks of dependence, tolerance and addiction with chronic use
were not explained to Patient A, and the use of benzodiazapines in conjunction with opioids was
not assessed for risk of accidental overdose.

7. Respondent prescribed Adderall (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine) to Patient A at

a higher than indicated starting dosage for various patient complaints without establishing

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


diagnoses through a proper focused history and assessment for DSM-V criteria for ADHD. Risks
of dependence, tolerance and addiction were not explained to Patient A by Respondent.

8. Respondent prescribed Phentermine, an appetite suppressant, to Patient A at a
higher than indicated starting dosage based on Patient A stating a desire to lose weight.
Respondent prescribed the appetite suppressant without taking a complete medical history,
without performing a physical examination and conducting appropriate studies to determine if
there are any contraindications to the use of the appetite suppressant by the patient, without
establishing that Patient A’s obesity represented a threat to her health, and without including a
program of dietary restrictions, modification of behavior and exercise. Patient A was continued
on appetite suppressants for more than 3 months despite Patient A not losing an average of 2
pounds per month or more, and, on the contrary, gaining weight while under Respondent’s care.
Respondent prescribed Phentermine, a pregnancy “Class X” (contraindicated) medication, to a
female of child-bearing age without establishing or documenting risks of pregnancy.

day, but this was increased on March 6, 2017, to three times a day without explanation. Three
previous emergency room x-ray images of Patient B’s lumbar spine from May 27, 2013, are

sacroiliac joints were normal. Opioids were continued through the entire period, without

the dosage without further evaluation, diagnosis or explanation. Risks of dependence, tolerance
and addiction with chronic use were not explained to Patient B, and the use of benzodiazapines in

conjunction with opioids was not assessed for risk of accidental overdose.

141. A dispensing practitioner must not allow a dispensing technician access to the

room or cabinet in which controlled substances and/or dangerous drugs are stored unless the

medical facility, including dispensing by U.S. mail and Federal Express. By doing so, Respondent
violated NAC 639.742(3)(f).
