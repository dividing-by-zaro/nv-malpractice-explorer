COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board)
hereby issues this Complaint (Complaint) against Carlos Enrique Fonte, M.D. (Respondent), a
licensed physician in Nevada. After investigating this matter, the IC! has a reasonable basis to
believe that Respondent has violated provisions of Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) Chapter 630 and
the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively Medical Practice Act). The IC
alleges the following facts:

1. Respondent was licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical
Practice Act, on August 25, 1990, and is currently licensed in active status (License No. 6114).

2. Patient A was a 90-year-old female at the time of the incidents in question. Her
name and date of birth are not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but this
information is disclosed in the Patient Designation contemporaneously served on Respondent with
a copy of this Complaint.

3. At the time of the events in question, Patient A was a resident of a nursing home in

Las Vegas, Nevada and suffered from dementia, among other conditions.

! At the time of filing, the IC was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Chairman, Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, and Aury
Nagy, M.D.

4. On October 7, 2014, at a location outside of the nursing home, Patient A underwent
a procedure by Respondent for the installation of a pacemaker with no apparent complications at
that time.

5. On October 20, 2014, Patient A complained of pain in her left hip and staff
reported a popping noise upon movement of her left leg from the hip area. An x-ray was ordered,
which showed no fracture or acute dislocation.

6. On October 21, 2014, nursing staff noted that Patient A’s left foot was cool to the
touch and her left leg exhibited skin color changes.

7. On October 21, 2014, a venous duplex ultrasound was performed. It revealed no
evidence of a deep vein thrombosis. However, on the same date, an arterial duplex ultrasound
revealed “no flow present” in Patient A’s left proximal superficial femoral artery, left popliteal
artery, left anterior and posterior tibial artery, and left dorsalis pedis artery. The report stated that
there was “severe mild atherosclerotic plaquing in the left lower extremity with no detectable flow
beyond the distal thigh.” Further evaluation with a computed tomography (CT) angiogram was
recommended, but was not ordered.

8. From October 1, 2014 through October 29, 2014, Patient A’s progress notes
indicated that Patient’s left leg was cool to the touch, exhibited skin color changes and Patient A
continued to experience pain in her left leg. Patient A was treated for pain.

9. On October 24, 2014, Patient A had a follow-up visit with Respondent.
Respondent was advised that Patient A’s daughter wanted to speak to Respondent about Patient A,
but Respondent refused to call her either before or during his evaluation of Patient A.

10. | Respondent instead relied on Patient A’s recall and reporting of her condition, in
spite of the fact that Patient A has dementia. Respondent’s medical records of Patient A reflect no
indication of the pain she had been experiencing in her left leg and no indication of the pain
medication she had been taking since October 20, 2014. The medical records of October 24,
2014, further reflect that Respondent examined Patient A’s legs and noted that pulses were
palpable and symmetrical, even though the arterial duplex ultrasound on October 21, 2014,

detected no flow present in Patient A’s left leg below the femoral artery. Respondent’s October

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners


24, 2014, medical record also noted “normal dorsalis pedis pulses, normal posterior tibial pulses”
even though the arterial duplex ultrasound on October 21, 2014, detected no flow present below
the femoral artery in Patient A’s left leg.

11. | Respondent’s medical record dated October 24, 2014, states that Patient A’s
cardiovascular exam indicates a bradycardic rate and irregular rhythm, but then states that she has
a history of symptomatic bradycardia, which was resolved after the pacemaker implantation,
indicating that the exam was not accurate.

12. Respondent failed to notice and document that the leg was cool to the touch and
there were skin color changes, which were noted by the nursing staff at Patient A’s nursing home
on October 21, 2014.

13. Respondent’s medical record of October 24, 2014, further indicated that Patient A
had no edema in her extremities, even though the day prior, the nurse practitioner at the nursing
home noted that both legs were swollen.

14. Respondent’s medical record dated October 24, 2014, was essentially the same as
the medical record of September 25, 2014, and was likely the result of a pre-populated electronic
medical record, calling into question whether Respondent actually performed a physical
examination of Patient A or instead just relied on an existing electronic medical record.

15. Respondent’s medical records of October 24, 2014, further listed eleven
medications that Patient A was taking, but omitted the hydrocodone she had been prescribed since
October 20, 2014.

16. Respondent’s medical records of October 24, 2014, further indicated that: Patient
A occasionally consumed alcohol, in spite of the fact that she was a resident of a nursing home; he
counseled her regarding cessation of smoking, even though her medical record indicates that she
ceased smoking in 1980; he counseled her in detail regarding lipid goals, even though Patient A
suffered from dementia and may not have understood a detailed explanation of lipid goals; he
counseled her regarding excessive sun and UV-light exposure, including tanning beds, even

though Patient A was a nursing home resident.

17. On October 29, 2014, Patient A underwent an ultrasound of her lower left leg and
an emergency angiograph, which showed total occlusion of the left limb aortic stent graft, left
common iliac, external iliac and common femoral arteries. The attending surgeon’s initial
assessment was that the leg would have to be amputated either above or below the knee.

18. On October 30, 2014, Patient A was taken to surgery for a bilateral, common
femoral endarterectomy, left profunda femoral endarterectomy, and a right femoral to left femoral
Gore-Tex graft, which surgery was successful and ultimately saved Patient A’s leg from

amputation.

COUNT I
(Malpractice)

15. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

16. Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician
is grounds for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

17. | Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 630.040 defines malpractice for the purpose
of NRS chapter 630 as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care,
skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

18. Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances, including but not limited to the conduct described herein, when he
failed to discuss Patient A’s condition with Patient A’s daughter either before or during the
evaluation of Patient A, given that Patient A was diagnosed with dementia.

19. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
(Failure to Maintain Timely, Legible, Accurate and Complete Medical Records)
20. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

21. Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) 630.3062(1)(a) provides that failure to maintain
timely, legible, accurate and complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and
care of a patient is grounds for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

22. Respondent failed to keep accurate and complete medical records when he
documented, inter alia, that Patient A’s left leg had palpable and symmetrical pulses and normal
dorsalies pedis pulses and normal posterior tibial pulses in spite of an arterial duplex ultrasound
that only days earlier detected no flow beyond the femoral artery.

23. Respondent failed to keep accurate and complete medical records, as demonstrated
by the fact that Respondent’s medical records further listed eleven medications that Patient A was
taking, but omitted the hydrocodone that she had been prescribed since October 20, 2014.

24, Respondent failed to keep accurate and complete medical records, as demonstrated
by the fact that his medical records further indicated that: Patient A occasionally consumed
alcohol, in spite of the fact that she was a resident of a nursing home; he counseled Patient A
regarding cessation of smoking, even though her medical record indicates that she ceased smoking
in 1980; he counseled her in detail regarding lipid goals, even though Patient A suffered from
dementia and may not have comprehended such a conversation; he counseled her regarding
excessive sun and UV-light exposure, including tanning beds, in spite of the fact that Patient A
was a resident of a nursing home.

25. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the IC prays:

1, That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him and give
him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein as set forth in NRS 630.339(2)
within twenty (20) days of service of the Complaint;

2. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing after holding an Early
Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Board determine what sanctions to impose if it finds and concludes that

there has been a violation or violations of the Medical Practice Act committed by Respondent;
