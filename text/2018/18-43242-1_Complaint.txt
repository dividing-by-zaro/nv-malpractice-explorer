Medical Practice Act).

Professional Regulation, Division of Professional Regulation (“Illinois Medical Board”) issued a
Consent Order in Case No. 2016-4798, and it became effective immediately. In said case,
Respondent was issued his license to practice medicine in Illinois, and was reprimanded upon

issuance.

3. The Illinois Medical Board accused and reprimanded Respondent for certain

professional and ethical issues that occurred during his residency and fellowship.

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of this
Complaint was approved, was composed of Wayne Hardwick, M.D., Mr. M. Neil Duxbury, and Aury Nagy, M.D.
