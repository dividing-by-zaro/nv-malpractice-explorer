BEFORE THE BOARD OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS
OF THE STATE OF NEVADA


Case No. 18-29352-2

FILED

In the Matter of Charges and

Complaint Against

DEVENDRAKUMAR IL. PATEL, M.D., FEB - 1 2018
NEVADA STATE BOARD OF

Respondent. MEDIOAL EXAMINERS

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee! (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), by and through Aaron Bart Fricke, Esq., Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Devendrakumar I. Patel, M.D. (Respondent) violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 and Nevada Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 630 (collectively, the Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its Complaint, stating
the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Nevada
(License No. 11068). He was originally licensed by the Board on July 23, 2004.

A. Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP) for the Treatment of Angina

2. EECP is a noninvasive therapy developed for the treatment of end-stage angina
pectoris that is refractory to conventional therapy (2.e., surgery, angioplasty) for acute myocardial
infarction and cardiogenic shock. EECP involves the sequential compression (inflation/deflation)
of cuffs wrapped around the patient's calves, thighs, and buttocks. By timing the
inflation/deflation sequence to the patient's cardiac cycle, the intention of EECP is to increase
diastolic aortic pressure, thereby increasing coronary perfusion pressure possibly by enhancing the

development of coronary collateral circulation and reducing the workload of the heart. Treatment

! The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, at the time the filing of the
Complaint was approved, was composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Wayne Hardwick, M.D., and Mr. M. Neil

Duxbury.

usually consists of one-hour sessions, five days a week, for seven weeks. EECP has been
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for management of refractory angina.

3. End-stage angina pectoris is defined as “disabling angina” (class III or class IV),
and is indicted for those who, in the opinion of a cardiologist or a cardiovascular surgeon, are not
readily amenable to surgical intervention.

4, Angina is the sensation of chest pain or pressure often with radiation to the left arm
or jaw that comes on with exertion or stress and is relieved with rest or medication. It can feel like
smothering shortness of breath or severe indigestion. It is caused when the heart muscle outworks
its blood supply.

5. Chronic stable angina is the occurrence of angina with predictable levels of
exertion, usually lasting less than five minutes. It is reproducible and usually is predictable.

B. Respondent’s Treatment of Patient A

6. Patient A was a 71-year-old female when she presented to Respondent for medical
care in November 2013. Patient A’s true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but
is disclosed in the Patient Designation served upon Respondent along with a copy of this
Complaint.

7. On November 8, 2013, Patient A presented to Respondent with progressively
increasing malaise, fatigue, and shortness of breath at less than normal exertion. Patient A had a
history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, rheumatoid arthritis,
chronic pain, osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, and prior deep venous thrombosis, and lived a
sedentary lifestyle. A stress test was conducted on November 13, 2013, which was abnormal. A
left heart catheterization, selective coronary artery angiography, and left ventriculogram were
performed at Northeastern Nevada Regional Hospital on November 10, 2013, which revealed
substantial coronary artery disease. Accordingly, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) was
performed in Salt Lake City, Utah, on December 18, 2013.

8. On July 18, 2014, Patient A presented to Respondent again for progressively
increasing shortness of breath and fatigue at less than usual exertion over the past 5-6 years, and

recent back pain and low blood pressure. Respondent recommended EECP therapy, and Patient A

underwent EECP therapy at Respondent’s medical practice during August and September 2014.
Respondent billed Patient A $600 for each session, for at least seventeen sessions, for a total of
$10,200.

9. Based on the medical evidence available to him, specifically, without an
assessment for and diagnosis of angina or angina class (such as how far Patient A could walk
before symptoms occur, or other physical assessments), without evidence of how Patient A had
responded to standard therapies or treatments, such as CABG, and without assessment or changes
in symptoms following CABG, the use of and recommendation of EECP was not indicated.

10. On information and belief, Respondent’s conduct in recommending and performing
EECP on Patient A was intentional, and made for his own financial benefit and pecuniary gain.

COUNTI
NRS 630.301(4) (Malpractice)

11. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set

12. Malpractice is grounds for disciplinary action against a licensee pursuant to

knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances when treating a patient.

14. As demonstrated by, but not limited to, the above-outlined facts, Respondent
committed malpractice with respect to his treatment of Patient A by failing to use reasonable care,
skill or knowledge in recommending and performing EECP on Patient A.

15. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
