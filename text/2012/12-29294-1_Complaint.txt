Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Chairman, Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., Member, and
Ms. Donna A. Ruthe, Member, by and through its counsel, Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq. and

been so licensed since May 18, 2004, by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant
to the provisions of NRS 630.

2. Patient A was a twenty-eight (28) year-old male at the time of the incidents in
question. His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this formal Complaint.

3. On or about October 17, 2008, Patient A presented to Respondent for consultation
regarding removal of a cyst on his left testicle. Respondent and Patient A agreed to out-patient
surgery with local anesthesia at Respondent's office.

4, On October 24, 2008, Patient A returned to Respondent's office for removal of the
cyst. Respondent, however, incorrectly performed a vasectomy on Patient A's right vas deferens.
Respondent became aware of the error when he moved to the left testicle. Respondent then
reapproximated the injured right vas deferens in preparation for re-attachment of the surgically
damaged tissue. Finally, Respondent removed the cyst from Patient A's left testicle.

5. The next day, on October 25, 2008, Patient A presented to Spring Valley Hospital
for the re-attachment of the surgically damaged tissue. Respondent then performed a right
vasovasostomy and repaired the right vas deferens.

Count I

6. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

7. Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a
physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

8. NRS 630.301(4) provides that malpractice of a physician is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

9. Respondent's care and treatment of Patient A as described above shows a failure to
use reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

10. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Respondent notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the
