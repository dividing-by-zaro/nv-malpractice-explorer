Elite Endeavors, LLC, that does business as the Allure Med Spa ("Allure") located at
6295 Sharlands Avenue, Suite 1, in Reno, Nevada.

4, Additionally, the "Dysport" was procured from Canadian internet websites and
pharmacies, Medica Depot and RxPad. Neither was a Nevada authorized and certified internet
pharmacy, and neither utilized a Nevada certified website.

5. As to the Botox advertising, a large Botox advertisement was on the front window
of Allure. Inside the Allure offices, professional services brochures referencing Botox were
displayed on the front counter. Allure's website also contained references to Botox injections and
not "Dysport".

6. The stock of "Dysport" was contained in a refrigerator and stored in a large, blue
plastic drinking cup that contained ten (10) unlabeled syringes. Each syringe contained
approximately 20 units of a clear liquid. Next to it, an unopened box labeled "Dysport” was found
behind two (2) bottles of juice and several unopened bottles of wine.

7. Respondent, moreover, admitted that he did not purchase or administer Botox at
this time. He further admitted that he had been negligent in updating brochures and the
Allure website advertising that contained references to Botox. He also admitted that he had
purchased the "Dysport" over the internet and from a Canadian pharmacy.
