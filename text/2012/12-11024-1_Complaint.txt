3. On June 17, 2005, Patient A had a gestational age of approximately 34 weeks when
she presented to the emergency room at the University Medical Center (hereinafter “UMC”) in
Las Vegas, Nevada, complaining of abdominal pressure, difficulty breathing, bilateral lower
extremity edema and spotting. She was admitted to UMC with a diagnosis of maternal
tachycardia and preeclampsia.

4. After Patient A was admitted, her blood pressure was 165/115, there was protein in
her urine, and she suffered from a severe headache. Further testing also diagnosed Patient A with
anemia and dyspnea. Approximately fourteen (14) hours after the patient was admitted to UMC,
Respondent personally reviewed Patient A’s chart and did not order induced labor.

5. On June 18, 2005, Patient A’s blood pressure was 164/88, her urine output was
very low, and she still complained of a headache. Respondent personally reviewed Patient A’s
chart a second time and, again, did not order induced labor.

6. On June 19, 2005, Patient A’s twenty-four (24)-hour urine protein test showed
seven (7) grams of protein. Her blood pressure ranged from 122-160/70-99. Patient A still
suffered from a severe headache. In addition, her oxygen saturation was decreased. Respondent
personally reviewed Patient A’s chart a third time and, again, did not order induced labor.

7. On June 20, 2005, Patient A was diagnosed with sudden onset pulmonary edema.
Approximately twenty-two (22) minutes after Patient A was diagnosed with sudden onset
pulmonary edema, emergency Caesarean section delivery of the unborn baby was initiated.

8. During the emergency Caesarean section delivery of the unborn baby, Patient A
suffered a cardiac arrest and died. The Clark County Coroner cited Patient A’s cause of death as
preeclampsia.

9. After resuscitation efforts for Patient A failed, the unborn baby was delivered via
Caesarean section. The baby suffered Hypoxia Induced Encephalopathy. As a result, the baby
suffered permanent mental and physical disabilities.

10. During Patient A’s four (4)-day hospital stay, Respondent made four (4) written
entries in the patient’s chart. Three (3) of the four (4) entries are untimed. All four (4) entries are

illegible, either in part or in whole, and are incomplete.
