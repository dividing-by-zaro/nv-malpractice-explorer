In the Matter of Charges and
Complaint Against
NERI BLANCO-CUEVAS, M.D.,

Respondent.

COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),
composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, and
Michael J. Fisher, M.D., at the time of the authorization of filing this formal complaint, by and
through Edward O. Cousineau, Esq., Deputy Executive Director for the Board, and counsel for the
Investigative Committee, having a reasonable basis to believe that Neri Blanco-Cuevas, M.D.,
hereinafter referred to as "Respondent," has violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent was originally issued a license to practice medicine in the state of
Nevada on February 26, 2004. Respondent’s licensure status is currently active, and at all times
alleged herein, Respondent was licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of NRS 630.

2. Patient A was a fifty-four-year-old female at the time of the events at issue. Her
true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. On October 26, 2007, Respondent performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with
an intraoperative cholangiogram on Patient A at Desert Springs Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada. The

medical records related to the surgical procedure specify it was without complication and Patient A
was discharged to home that same day.

4. On November 5, 2007, Patient A presented to Summerlin Hospital in Las Vegas,
Nevada with complaints of abdominal pain. It was determined she was suffering from jaundice and
potentially sepsis. Respondent evaluated Patient A that same day and decided that an exploratory
laparotomy should be accomplished.

5. The exploratory laparotomy was performed on November 6, 2007. The operative
note, which was dictated over a month and half after the surgical procedure, indicates that an injury
to Patient A’s common bile duct was identified. The area was debrided. Respondent then placed a
“J ureteral stent, 8.0-French,” in both ends to repair the bile duct injury. The operative note indicates
that Patient A tolerated the surgical procedure well with no complications. Patient A was discharged
to home a few days after the surgical procedure.

6. On November 11, 2007, Patient A again presented to Summerlin Hospital with
complaints of abdominal pain anew. Diagnostic testing determined Patient A’s common bile duct
was obstructed and that the previously placed stent had migrated out of position. Shortly thereafter,
Patient A underwent a choledochojejunostomy, which was also performed by Respondent. Patient A
effectively recovered from this surgical procedure and was discharged to home thereafter.

7. It is now alleged by the Investigative Committee that Respondent’s care and
treatment of Patient A during the November 6, 2007 surgical procedure constitutes malpractice, as
Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar
circumstances when she used an inappropriate stent to repair Patient A’s common bile duct injury,
failed to place or implant a T-tube and appropriate drainage devices during the surgical procedure,
and failed to follow up with a post-operative X-ray of the operative area to confirm proper
placement and positioning of the stent.

8. Based upon the foregoing, Respondent has violated NRS 630.301(4), and is subject
to discipline as provided by NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1, That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing;

2. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against her, the time
and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions against her,

3. That the Board determine what sanctions it determines to impose for the violation
or violations committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of facts,
conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed;

5. That the Board take such other and further action as may be just and proper in these

premises.
