3. On January 11, 2010, Respondent performed a total hip replacement surgery on
Patient A. Physician Assistant, Kerry Seip, was Respondent’s assistant. Dr. Brian Hager was the
anesthesiologist.

4. Dr. Hager initially attempted a spinal anesthetic; however, it was unsuccessful. He,
therefore, used an indwelling femoral nerve block instead of a spinal anesthetic.

5. Post-surgery, Respondent prescribed the following medications for Patient A:
a) Toradol, an NSAID; and b) Lovenox, an anticoagulant.

6. On January 12, 2010, Patient A began experiencing neurological distress in both of
her lower extremities. Patient A’s medical records for January 12, 2010 do not demonstrate that
Respondent evaluated the patient.

7. On January 13, 2010, Patient A’s neurological distress worsened. Patient A’s
lower extremities were paralyzed. Patient A’s medical records for January 13, 2010 do not
demonstrate that Respondent evaluated the patient.

8. On January 14, 2010, Respondent evaluated Patient A for the first time since her
surgery. Based on Patient A’s neurological distress, Respondent ordered an MRI stat of Patient
A’s lumbar and thoracic spine. This MRI was not performed despite Respondent’s order. Patient
A’s medical records for January 14, 2010 do not demonstrate that Respondent followed up to
ensure the MRI was performed and reviewed.

9. On January 15, 2010, an MRI was finally performed on Patient A’s lumbar and
thoracic spine at the urgent request of another physician. The lumbar MRI showed a large
epidural hematoma that comprised seventy percent (70%) of Patient A’s spinal canal. The
thoracic MRI showed that the epidural hematoma extended to T8 on Patient A’s spinal column.

10. On January 15, 2010, emergency surgery was performed to evacuate the epidural
hematoma. Respondent did not perform this surgery.

11. Despite the emergency evacuation of the epidural hematoma, Patient A never
regained feeling in her lower extremities. Patient A was ultimately diagnosed as a paraplegic.
