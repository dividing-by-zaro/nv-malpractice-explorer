COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed
at the time filing was approved of, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Ms. Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU,
LUTCF, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., having a reasonable basis to believe that
John Joseph Dudek, Jr., M.D. hereinafter referred to as Dr. Dudek, has violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the
Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Dr. Dudek is licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
(License No. 3293), and was originally licensed on March 13, 1977, by the Nevada State Board of
Medical Examiners pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the NRS

2. Dr. Dudek practices urology at 2020 Goldring Avenue, Suite 506, in Las Vegas,
Nevada.

3. Dr. Dudek rents space within his office to Riveka Frey, R.N., aka Reva Frey, who
owns and operates her independent business, “Facial Enhancements by Reva,” in the office space
rented from Dr. Dudek.

4. Dr. Dudek purportedly acts in the capacity as “medical director” for Ms. Frey’s
practice and is available if there is a medical issue that arises from Ms. Frey’s procedures.

However, Ms. Frey performs evaluations of the patients upon which she performs procedures and

determines the treatment to be provided, including which dangerous drug(s) to administer to
patients, independently from Dr. Dudek. Pursuant to NRS 454.213, dangerous drugs may only be
possessed and administered by a licensed practitioner, as defined by NRS 454.00958, or they may
be administered by a registered nurse at the direction of a prescribing physician. Ms. Frey’s
patients are not evaluated by Dr. Dudek nor are they prescribed dangerous drugs by Dr. Dudek.

5. Dr. Dudek, until very recently, knowingly allowed Ms. Frey to order dangerous
drugs, including, but not limited to, Botox, Restylane, Juvederm and other dangerous drugs used
commonly in cosmetic procedures, through his account with the drug wholesalers. Ms. Frey
would indicate to Dr. Dudek’s office manager what drugs she wished to order and would pay for
them with her credit card. Dr. Dudek signed an acknowledgment for receipt of the drugs after
delivery of the drugs to his office and the drugs would be turned over to Ms. Frey.

6. The dangerous drugs ordered by Ms. Frey and delivered to Dr. Dudek’s office
included Latisse, a drug that is to be dispensed only. Pursuant to NRS 454.215(3), a licensed
physician may only dispense a dangerous drug if authorized by the Nevada State Board of
Pharmacy in accordance with NRS 639.23505 Respondent does not, nor has he ever, held a
certificate of registration to dispense in the state of Nevada. Ms. Frey is not legally authorized to
dispense any dangerous drug.

7. Dr. Dudek has little or no experience and training in cosmetic procedures,
including the performance of facial cosmetic procedures, and therefore would not be qualified to
have performed the evaluations or make the diagnoses and treatment determinations for those
patients that saw Ms. Frey in her independent practice operating in Dr. Dudek’s office.

Count I

8. NRS 630.305(1)(e) provides that aiding, assisting, employing or advising, directly
or indirectly, any unlicensed person to engage in the practice of medicine is grounds for the
initiation of discipline.

9. NRS 630.020(1) states that the practice of medicine means “[t]o diagnose, treat, correct,
prevent or prescribe for any human disease, ailment, injury, infirmity deformity or other

condition...by any means or instrumentality.”

10. Dr. Dudek allowed and assisted an unlicensed individual, directly and indirectly, to
engage in the practice of medicine when he knowingly allowed Ms. Frey to operate her own
independent practice out of his office from which she independently evaluated and treated patients
and administered dangerous drugs, which is the practice of medicine.

11. Accordingly, Dr. Dudek is in violation of NRS 630.305(1)(e) and is subject to
discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

Count IT

12. | NRS 630.306(3) provides that administering, dispensing or prescribing a controlled
substance or dangerous drug except as authorized by law is grounds for initiating discipline
against a licensee.

13. As indicated above, NRS 454.213 provides dangerous drugs may only be possessed
and administered by a licensed practitioner or by a registered nurse at the direction of a prescribing
physician.

14. Dr. Dudek knowingly allowed Ms. Frey to possess and administer dangerous drugs
to patients for whom he had not evaluated, diagnosed, nor prescribed dangerous drugs.

15. Accordingly, Dr. Dudek is in violation of NRS 630.306(3) and is subject to
discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

Count Ii

16. | NRS 630.306(3) provides that administering, dispensing or prescribing a controlled
substance or dangerous drug except as authorized by law is grounds for initiating discipline
against a licensee.

17. As indicated above, NRS 454.215 provides that a licensed physician may only
dispense a dangerous drug if authorized by the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy in accordance
with NAC 639.742(1).

18. Ms. Frey dispensed Latisse, a dangerous drug meant to be dispensed only, which
she ordered and obtained possession of through Dr. Dudek’s account with drug wholesalers and
which Ms. Frey was not lawfully authorzied to dispense any dangerous drug nor was Dr. Dudek as

he does not, and has not, held a certificate of registration to dispense from the Nevada State Board
of Pharmacy.

19. Accordingly, due to Dr. Dudek allowing a dangerous drug to be dispensed in a
manner not authorized by law, Dr. Dudek is in violation of NRS 630.306(3) and is subject to
discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

Count IV

20. NRS 630.306(5) provides that practicing or offering to practice beyond the scope
permitted by law or performing services which the licensee knows or has reason to know that he is
not competent to perform or which are beyond the scope of his training is grounds for initiating
discipline against a licensee.

21. Dr. Dudek has little or no training or experience in the performance of facial
cosmetic procedures and accordingly, if Dr. Dudek did evaluate or prescribe dangerous drugs for
the purpose of facial procedures for any of Ms. Frey’s patients/clients, he was practicing beyond
the scope of his training and was not competent to perform said procedures.

22. Accordingly, Dr. Dudek may be in violation of NRS 630.306(5) and is subject to
discipline by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners give Dr. Dudek notice of the
charges herein against him and give him notice that he may file an answer to the Complaint herein
as set forth in Section 630.339 of the Nevada Revised Statutes within twenty (20) days of service
of the Complaint.

2. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners set a time and place for a
formal hearing after holding an Early Case Conference pursuant to NRS 630.339(3);

3. That the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners determine what sanctions it
determines to impose if it determines there has been a violation or violations of the Medical
Practice Act (NRS Chapter 630) committed by Dr. Dudek; and
