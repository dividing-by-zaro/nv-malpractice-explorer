Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, by and
through Erin L. Albright, Esq., Deputy General Counsel and Attorney for the IC, having a
reasonable basis to believe that Bradly S. Walker, M.D. (Respondent), violated the provisions of
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 (Medical Practice Act), hereby issues its formal
Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 7042), and has been
so licensed by the Board since March 5, 1994, pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice
Act.

2. Respondent is currently licensed to practice medicine in Nevada, and was so
licensed at the time of the incident complained of in this matter in the state of Idaho.

3. Upon information and belief, Respondent’s controlled substances registration from
the Idaho State Board of Pharmacy has been inactive since 2002. Nonetheless, Respondent

continued to prescribe controlled substances in the state of Idaho.

4, On or about March 5, 2012, Respondent and the Idaho State Board of Medicine
entered into a Stipulation and Order where, in addition to other conditions, Respondent is
prohibited for a minimum of five (5) years from prescribing, administering, dispensing, ordering,
writing orders for, giving verbal orders for, or possessing any controlled substances in the state of
Idaho unless he obtains the required registration with the Idaho State Board of Pharmacy. (See
Exhibit 1.)

5. If Respondent violates or breaches any terms or conditions of the Stipulation and
Order, the Idaho State Board of Medicine reserved the right to institute formal disciplinary
proceedings for any and all possible violations and breaches. In addition, if Respondent tests
positive on any drug/alcohol screening or relapses, Respondent’s license to practice medicine in
the state of Idaho shall be summarily suspended by the Idaho State Board of Medicine.

6. Furthermore, Respondent omitted, failed and/or refused to notify the Board in a
timely manner of the action taken against his medical license by the state of Idaho.

COUNT I

7. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by
reference as though fully set forth herein.

8. NRS 630.301(3) provides that any disciplinary action, including, without
limitation, the revocation, suspension, modification or limitation of a license to practice any type
of medicine, taken by another state is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

9. The Stipulation and Order limiting Respondent’s ability to prescribe, administer,
dispense, order, write orders for, give verbal orders for, or possess any controlled substances in the
state of Idaho constitutes a disciplinary action taken by another state against Respondent that is
grounds for initiating discipline against Respondent.

10. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT II
11. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set

above-outlined disciplinary action taken by the state of Idaho.
