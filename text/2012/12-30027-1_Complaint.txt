4, Upon information and belief, at the end of February 2011, Respondent and Patient
A began a sexual relationship, which lasted approximately three months.

5. Upon information and belief, Patient A requested that Respondent administer
testosterone and vitamin B-12 injections to Patient A after he commenced a sexual relationship
with Respondent. Respondent initially denied Patient A’s request because the administration of
testosterone injections required the patient’s blood work.

6. Upon information and belief, Patient A subsequently provided Respondent with the
requisite blood work for the administration of testosterone injections. Upon receipt and review of
Patient A’s blood work, Respondent administered two injections of testosterone and one injection
of vitamin B-12 to Patient A. These injections were administered to Patient A in Respondent’s
home without the knowledge and/or supervision of Respondent’s supervising physician.

7, Respondent did not keep health care records for Patient A.

COUNT I

8. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set
forth herein,

9, NRS 630.275(7) provides that the Board shall adopt regulations regarding the
grounds and procedures respecting disciplinary actions against physician assistants.

10. NAC 630.380(1)(d) provides that the performance of medical services by a
physician assistant that have not been approved by the supervising physician is grounds for
instituting disciplinary action against a physician assistant.

vitamin B-12 to Patient A without the approval of her supervising physician.
