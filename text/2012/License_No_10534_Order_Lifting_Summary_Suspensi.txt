An Order of Summary Suspension was entered on November 27, 2012, by the
Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed of
Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman, Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and
Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, regarding John Blackburn Siegler, M.D. (Dr. Siegler).
Following the Order of Summary Suspension, Dr. Siegler fully complied with the Investigative
Committee and was found fit and competent to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety
to his patients in the state of Nevada by a neutral and independent evaluator.

Furthermore, as a result of Dr. Siegler’s actions subsequent to the Order of Summary
Suspension and relying upon the independent evaluation of Dr. Siegler, the
Investigative Committee has reasonably determined that Dr. Siegler is not a threat to the health,
safety and welfare of the public and that the public is not at imminent risk of harm. It is; therefore,
appropriate to lift the summary suspension of Dr. Siegler’s license to practice medicine in the state
of Nevada with no restrictions, conditions or limitations thereto.!

If

' As with all Licensees subject to the jurisdiction of this Board, nothing in this Order shall waive the Board’s statutory
authority regarding any future investigations, actions, or proceedings.
