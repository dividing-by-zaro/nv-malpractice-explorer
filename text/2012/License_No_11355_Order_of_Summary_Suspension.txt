Prior to the preparation of this Order of Summary Suspension, — the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) staff presented evidence and information to an
Investigative Committee of the Board, composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, regarding
Vinay Kumar Bararia, M.D. (Dr. Bararia). Upon review of the evidence and information
presented by Board staff, the Investigative Committee hereby IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDS
Dr. Bararia’s license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada pursuant to
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 630.326(1), based upon the following preliminary findings:

1. Dr. Bararia is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada and
was originally licensed on March 4, 2005. Dr. Bararia practices medicine in the Las Vegas area
and his primary specialty is listed with the Board as internal medicine.

2. On or about March 2, 2012, Dr. Bararia was arrested on a criminal Complaint in
United States District Court, District of Nevada, for Conspiracy to Distribute a Controlled
Substance. That Complaint detailed five (5) different undercover officer illegal purchases of
controlled substances from Dr. Bararia. On that same day, as part of the Order Setting Conditions
of Release, Dr. Bararia voluntarily surrendered his Drug Enforcement Administration certificate of
registration, in writing, and was prohibited from ordering, possessing, dispensing or prescribing
any controlled substances.

3. Upon information and belief, on or about March 7, March 14, March 15, March 16,
March 26, March 27, March 28, April 2, April 5, April 9 and April 13, 2012, Dr. Bararia violated
the conditions of his pretrial release by ordering scheduled controlled substances at
Centennial Hills Hospital, or otherwise prescribing scheduled controlled substances, in
Las Vegas, Nevada.

4. As a result, Dr. Bararia was re-arrested on or about May 3, 2012 for violating the
terms of his pretrial release. It is believed that Dr. Bararia is no longer incarcerated.

5. On or about June 26, 2012, an indictment issued against Dr. Bararia in
United States District Court, District of Nevada, charging him with
Conspiracy to Distribute a Controlled Substance, Five (5) counts’ of
Distribution of a Controlled Substance, Possession with Intent to distribute of [sic] a Controlled
Substance and Five (5) counts of Conspiracy to Distribute Oxycodone.

As a result of the foregoing, the Investigative Committee reasonably determines and
believes that due to Dr. Bararia’s alleged violations of the conditions and terms of his pretrial
release, and including the initial and repeated illegal sales of controlled substances and the blatant
violation of federal and state prescribing controlled substances’ laws, the health, safety and
welfare of the public is at imminent risk of harm and that a summary suspension of Dr. Bararia’s
license to practice medicine is necessary to remove said risk of imminent harm to the health, safety
and welfare of the public.

Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
of Vinay Kumar Bararia, M.D. (License No. 11355) is HEREBY SUSPENDED until further
order of the Investigative Committee or Board; and,

Order, pursuant to NRS 630.326(2), to determine whether this suspension may continue, unless
the parties mutually agree to a different or divergent time frame.
