The Investigative Committee ("IC") of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
comprised of, at the time of authorizing the filing of this complaint, Theodore B. Berndt, M.D.,
Chairman, Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D.,
Member, by and through Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., Deputy General Counsel, having a reasonable
basis to believe that Navneet Sharda, M.D., hereinafter referred to as “Respondent,” has violated
the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal
Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed to practice medicine in active status
(License No. 8200), and has been so licensed since June 10, 1997, by the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the NRS.

2. On or about October 6, 2011, the IC of Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
discovered that Respondent had abandoned numerous medical records at two (2) previous places
of business located at 2435 Fire Mesa Drive and 4550 E. Charleston Boulevard in Las Vegas,
Nevada. This abandonment was set in motion by foreclosure and eviction proceedings against the
owner of the real property, BDS & Sons, LLC, an entity in which it is believed that Respondent
was a 49% owner.

3. Upon information and belief, BDS & Sons, LLC previously leased the building(s)
to Sun Medical Group, LLC. Respondent was a 100% owner of Sun Medical Group, LLC.

4, Despite his ownership interests in the aforementioned business entities and
involvement as the physician of record for many of the patients whose medical records were
located at the two (2) businesses, Respondent denied responsibility for the abandoned medical
records on several occasions. Respondent subsequently admitted that the abandoned medical
records were his responsibility.

5. Upon information and belief, Respondent then took possession of the medical
records on or about November 17, 2011. This was over one month after the IC discovered that the
medical records were abandoned in Respondent's two (2) former places of business. The
abandoned medical records included patient charts, patient identification and demographics,
medical histories, films, etc.
