Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, by and
through Erin L. Albright, Esq., Board Deputy General Counsel and attorney for the IC, having a

Complaint, stating the IC’s charges and allegations as follows:

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The following facts are pertinent to a determination on this matter.
A. Respondent’s Licensure Status in Nevada

the provisions of the Medical Practice Act.

2. Respondent is currently licensed in active-probation status (License No. 7635) in

OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL


4. On June 8, 2012, the Board adopted a Settlement, Waiver and Consent Agreement
(Agreement) in which Respondent agreed that the Board may find she violated two (2) counts of
the formal Complaint and agreed that her license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada be
revoked, with said revocation stayed for thirty-six (36) months subject to the terms and conditions
outlined in the Agreement.

B. Respondent’s Licensure Status in New Mexico

5. At the time of the incidents complained of in this matter, Respondent was also
licensed to practice medicine in the state of New Mexico.

6. In December 2009, the New Mexico Medical Board (NM Board) approved an
Agreed Order with Respondent. (See a true and correct copy of the Agreed Order attached hereto
as Exhibit 1.) Pursuant to the Agreed Order, Respondent agreed to provide quarterly affidavits to
the NM Board attesting to her compliance with the terms set forth in the Agreed Order. Id.

7. Upon information and belief, Respondent failed to provide any quarterly affidavits
to the NM Board attesting to her compliance with the terms set forth in the Agreed Order.

8. On August 26, 2011, the NM Board sent a Notice of Contemplated Action (NCA)
by certified mail to Respondent. (See a true and correct copy of the NCA attached hereto as
Exhibit 2.) An Amended NCA was sent on September 2, 2011, by certified mail to Respondent.
(See a true and correct copy and of the Amended NCA attached hereto as Exhibit 3.) As outlined
in the NCA and the Amended NCA, the NM Board sought to impose sanctions against
Respondent, including, but not limited to, the revocation of Respondent’s license to practice
medicine in the state of New Mexico, due to her failure to submit quarterly affidavits attesting to
her compliance with the terms set forth in the Agreed Order. Id.

9. Pursuant to the terms of both Notices, Respondent was required to request a
hearing within twenty (20) days after service of each Notice. Id. If Respondent failed to request a
hearing, each Notice outlined that the NM Board would impose sanctions against Respondent,
including, but not limited, the revocation of Respondent’s license to practice medicine in the state
of New Mexico. Id.

of medicine, taken by another state is grounds for initiating discipline against a licensee.

practice medicine in the state of New Mexico constitutes a disciplinary action taken by another
state against Respondent that is grounds for initiating discipline against Respondent.

provided in NRS 630.352.

COUNT I

17. All of the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated by

DEFAULT DECISION AND ORDER

THIS MATTER came before the New Mexico Medical Board (the “Board”) on
November 10, 2011 for decision on the Notice of Contemplated Action (“NCA”)
authorized by the Board against Maryanne D. Phillips, M.D. (“Respondent”).

The Administrative Prosecutor presented to the Board a copy of the NCA sent by
certified mail on August 26, 2011 marked as Exhibit 1 and an amended NCA sent by
certified mail on September 2, 2011 marked as Exhibit 2. The allegations set forth
against Respondent were:

. In December 2009 the Board approved an Agreed Order with Respondent which
provided, in part, that Respondent would provide quarterly affidavits to the Board
attesting to her compliance with the terms set forth in the Agreed Order. To date,
Respondent has submitted none of the affidavits required by the Agreed Order. The

| Agreed Order further provides that a breach thereof shall constitute conduct unbecoming
in a person licensed to practice medicine as set forth in NMSA 1979 §61-6-15(D)(29).

Also, in January 2011, Respondent entered into a Settlement Agreement with the
Nevada Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to which she was, among other things, to
receive a public reprimand and be placed on probation. The factual basis for the action

by the Nevada Board was Respondent’s writing prescriptions for controlled substances
for her husband, who was not her patient. Respondent failed to inform the Board of the
action by the Nevada Board which is a violation of §61-6-15(D)(21) NMSA 1978, failure
to report to the Board any adverse action taken against Respondent by another licensing
jurisdiction.

The NCA notified Respondent that if she did not request a hearing within twenty
(20) days after service of the NCA the Board would take the contemplated action, i.e.,
imposing sanctions that could include the denial of your application for a license to
practice medicine in the State of New Mexico, and there will be no judicial review of
their decision.

2009,

WHEREAS, a quorum of the Board being present and a vote being duly taken, it
