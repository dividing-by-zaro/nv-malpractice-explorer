an independent medical expert to review the medical records of several patients treated by
Respondent. The record review included those of Patients A, B, C, D, and E.

5. In May of 2010, Patient A presented to Respondent with complaints of mild
depression. After Patient A’s evaluation, Respondent diagnosed Patient A with Bipolar Disorder.
It is the opinion of the aforementioned independent medical expert that Respondent’s medical
documentation is substantially lacking and fails to support his diagnosis of Patient A, and that
those medical records that were created by Respondent are nearly or entirely illegible in nature.

6. In August of 2010, Patient B presented to Respondent for a psychological
evaluation. After Patient B’s evaluation, Respondent diagnosed Patient B with Major Depressive
Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It is the opinion of the aforementioned
independent medical expert that Respondent’s medical documentation is substantially lacking and
fails to support his diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder for Patient B.

7. From approximately October of 2008 to January of 2011, Patient C was treated by
Respondent for Bipolar Disorder. It is the opinion of the aforementioned independent medical
expert that during this timeframe, Respondent created minimal medical records related to the care
and treatment of Patient C, and those medical records that were created by Respondent are nearly
or entirely illegible in nature.

8. From approximately August of 2008 to August of 2010, Patient D was treated by
Respondent for depression and PTSD. It is the opinion of the aforementioned independent
medical expert that during this time frame, Respondent created minimal medical records related to
the care and treatment of Patient D, and those medical records that were created by Respondent are
nearly or entirely illegible in nature.

9. From February of 2006 to January of 2011, Patient E was treated by Respondent for
anxiety and depression. It is the opinion of the aforementioned independent medical expert that
during this time frame, Respondent created minimal medical records related to the care and
treatment of Patient E, and those medical records that were created by Respondent are nearly or
entirely illegible in nature.
