FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee ("IC") of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners,
comprised of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Chairman, Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., Member, and
Donna A. Ruthe, Member, by and through Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., Deputy General Counsel and
attorney for the IC, having a reasonable basis to believe that Paul Cummings Ludlow, M.D.,
hereinafter referred to as “Respondent,” has violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630, hereby issues its First Amended Complaint, stating the Investigative
Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent's license is currently in active status (License No. 3496), and he has
been so licensed since March 4, 1978, by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, pursuant
to the provisions of NRS Chapter 630.

2. Patient A was a sixty-two (62) year old male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation already served on Respondent along with a copy of the formal Complaint.

3. On or about March 8, 2007, Patient A presented to Respondent with a ten (10) to
fifteen (15) year history of a mass in the right parotid gland. The mass was unchanged in size and

occasionally hard. A CT scan showed the mass to involve the superficial and deep lobes with
extension to the stylomastoid foramen and a question of the mass tracking along the facial nerve.

4, Physical examination on March 8, 2007 showed the mass to be 3.5 to 4.0 cm.

5. On March 13, 2007, an ultrasound-guided Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy
was performed on Patient A. The FNA showed nondiagnostic findings. The radiologist
recommended possible CT guidance and a core biopsy.

6. An MRI performed on that same day showed a large mass in the mid parotid gland
extending to the deep lobe. The MRI report did not mention the facial nerve.

7, Surgery for the removal of the mass was planned. However, there are no chart
notes regarding the review of the FNA or the MRI with Patient A by Respondent, and no
discussions with Patient A regarding the possible etiology of the parotid mass, any further work-up
including observation versus surgery, the detailed nature of the surgery or its risks, complications
or possible alternatives.

8. Surgery was performed on April 16, 2007. A frozen section analysis of the mass
revealed a schwannoma. The surgery sacrificed the facial nerve, so Patient A suffered a severed
facial nerve.

9. Given the MRI finding, the risks of severing the facial nerve were of paramount
importance and the most feared complication from this type of surgery. The records do not
demonstrate any discussion with Patient A of the potential risks to the facial nerve or any related
diagnosis, etiology and treatment plan as described above.

10. Respondent failed to maintain timely, legible, accurate and complete medical
records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of Patient A, as described above, by, among
other things, failing and omitting to keep a record of any discussion and/or review of the FNA and
MRI with Patient A; failing to discuss and record the possible etiology of the parotid mass and
potential further work-up including observation versus surgery; failing to discuss and record the
detailed nature of the surgery or its risks, complications or possible alternatives; and failing to
discuss and record the risks of severing the facial nerve and/or related complications from this type

of surgery with Patient A.
