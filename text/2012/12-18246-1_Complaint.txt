COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),
composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M. D., Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, and
Michael J. Fisher, M.D., at the time of the authorization of filing this formal complaint, by and
through Edward O. Cousineau, Deputy Executive Director for the Board, and counsel for the
Investigative Committee, having a reasonable basis to believe that Michael L. Fishell, M.D.,
hereinafter referred to as "Respondent," has violated the provisions of NRS Chapter 630, hereby
issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as
follows:

1. Respondent was originally issued a license to practice medicine in the state of
Nevada on June 3, 2000. Respondent’s licensure status is currently active, and at all times alleged
herein, Respondent was licensed by the Board, pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the
Nevada Revised Statutes.

2. Patient A was a seventy-one-year-old female at the time of the events at issue. Her
true identity is not disclosed herein to protect her privacy, but is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A first presented to Respondent’s medical office, which is located in

Las Vegas, Nevada, in early August of 2008 with complaints of bi-lateral back and leg pain. After

evaluation, Respondent and Patient A agreed that epidural steroid injections would be attempted to
alleviate Patient A’s pain. Patient A underwent four-level transforaminal epidural procedure on
August 14, 2008. The procedure was without complication and Patient A was discharged to home
that day with instructions to follow up with Respondent in a few weeks.

4. On September 11, 2008, Patient A returned to Respondent and advised that the
epidural procedure had only provided Patient A short-term relief from pain and her pain had returned
as previous. As a result, on September 18, 2008, Patient A underwent a second epidural procedure.
This procedure was thought to be without complication and Patient A was discharged to home that
same day.

5. On September 20, 2008, Patient A was admitted to the St. Rose Hospital emergency
room. Subsequent inquiry by hospital staff established that a hollow needle catheter had been left in
Patient A’s coccygeal area after the epidural procedure a few days previous. Thereafter, Patient A
was hospitalized and placed on antibiotic therapy due an infection that had developed at the site of
the catheter.

6. It is now alleged by the Investigative Committee that Respondent’s care and
treatment of Patient A constitutes malpractice, as Respondent failed to use the reasonable care,
skill, or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances, when he erroneously left a
medical device in Patient A after an epidural procedure.

7. Based upon the foregoing, Respondent has violated NRS 630.301(4), and is subject
to discipline as provided by NRS 630.352.

WHEREFORE, the Investigative Committee prays:

1. That the Board set a time and place for a formal hearing;

2. That the Board give Respondent notice of the charges herein against him, the time
and place set for the hearing, and the possible sanctions against him;

3. That the Board determine what sanctions it determines to impose for the violation
or violations committed by Respondent;

4. That the Board make, issue and serve on Respondent its findings of facts,

conclusions of law and order, in writing, that includes the sanctions imposed;
