3. Upon information and belief, on or about October 21, 2011, Las Vegas Laser and
Lipo emailed a mass mailing flyer to target individuals/businesses as part of a mass-marketing
campaign advertising the anti-wrinkle product Xeomin. (See a true and correct copy of the email
attached hereto as Exhibit 1.)

4. The flyer contained the phrase “Shot by the best in town!!!” Id.

5. The flyer also contained the phrase, “We are offering an introduction (sic) price of
$400.00 per 50 unit vial (similar to Botox) AND a $50.00 credit in our office that can be used on

any OTHER procedure, product, or treatment! (even that day, just not towards the discounted

Xeomin).” Id.

6. All of the allegations in the above paragraphs are hereby incorporated as if fully set
forth herein.

7. NRS 630.304(2) provides that advertising the practice of medicine in a false,
deceptive or misleading manner is grounds for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

8. NRS 630.306(2)(b) provides that engaging in any conduct that the Board has
determined is a violation of the standards of practice established by regulation of the Board is
grounds for initiating disciplinary action against a licensee.

9. Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 630.190(1)(c) provides that a physician shall
not advertise the practice of medicine in a manner that claims or implies professional superiority
of the performance of any professional service in a manner superior to that of other physicians.

10. NAC 630.190(1)(e) provides that a physician shall not advertise the practice of
medicine in a manner that includes any false, deceptive or misleading statement in order to induce
any person to purchase, utilize or acquire any professional services or to enter into any obligation

abilities or self-laudatory statement calculated to attract patients, and which has a tendency to
mislead the public or produce unrealistic expectations in particular cases.

13. NAC 630.190(2) further provides that for purposes of paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of
NAC 630.190(1), any statement or other advertising is sufficiently false if it has the tendency to
deceive, mislead or harm the public because of its false, deceptive, misleading or harmful
character; or produce unrealistic expectations in particular cases, even though no member of the
public is actually deceived, misled or harmed, or no unrealistic expectations are actually produced
by the statement or advertising.

14. Respondent’s use of the phrase “Shot by the best in town!!!” violates
NAC 630.190(1)(c) by claiming or implying the professional superiority of Respondent.

15. | Respondent’s use of the phrase “Shot by the best in town!!!” violates
NAC 630.190(1)(e), as it is a false, deceptive or misleading statement used to induce any person
to purchase, utilize or acquire Respondent’s professional services or to enter into an obligation or
transaction relating thereto.

16. | Respondent’s use of the phrase “We are offering an introduction (sic) price of
$400.00 per 50 unit vial (similar to Botox) AND a $50.00 credit in our office that can be used on
any OTHER procedure, product, or treatment! (even that day, just not towards the discounted
Xeomin)y’ violates NAC 630.190(1)(g), as it is false, deceptive and/or misleading in regard to the
cost of the services performed.

17. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Board as
provided in NRS 630.352.
