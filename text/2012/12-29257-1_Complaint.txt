The Investigative Committee ("IC") of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
("Board"), comprised of, at the time of authorizing the filing of this Complaint,
Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman, Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and
Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, by and through its counsel, Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq.,
Board General Counsel, having a _ reasonable basis to _ believe that
Kofi Ebenezer Sarfo, M.D., hereinafter referred to as “Respondent,” has violated the provisions of

so licensed since November 3, 2004, by the Board pursuant to the provisions of NRS 630.

2. The true identity of any patients referenced herein has not been disclosed to protect
their privacy, but their identities are disclosed in the Patient Designation served on Respondent
along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A was a sixteen (16)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in question.
Upon information and belief, Patient A sought medical care and treatment for pain, headache,

prescribed Lortab and Soma to Patient A with monthly refills without a thorough history of the
back pain and without a thorough medical workup for the etiology of the back pain. Subsequently,
the Lortab and Soma was repeatedly refilled by Respondent.

4. No documentation exists in the medical record of a thorough medical history and
medical work-up of the back pain to determine the etiology and/or rule out other causes.
Additionally, no attempt was made to treat the pain in this young patient with anything other than
narcotics and muscle relaxers.

5. Lastly, the Electronic Medical Records “EMRs” were not signed by Respondent in
a timely manner. The medical records were electronically signed up to nine (9) months after
providing the medical care and treatment.

6. Patient B was an eighteen (18)-year-old male at the time of the incidents in
question. Upon information and belief, Patient B sought medical care and treatment for shortness
of breath, chest discomfort, back pain and headache from September 24, 2009, to January 8, 2010.
Respondent prescribed Lortab, and later prescribed Soma, repeated with monthly refills.

7. No documentation exists in the medical record of a thorough medical history and
medical work-up of the back pain to determine the etiology and/or rule out other causes.
Additionally, no attempt was made to treat the pain in this young patient with anything other than
narcotics and muscle relaxers.

8. The medical records also contain identical phrases and templates from visit to visit.
On the October, November and December, 2009 records, the same, exact history is listed, “[t]he
back pain has been present for 6 days and is currently moderate in intensity.”

9. Lastly, the EMRs are not signed by Respondent in a timely manner. Some medical
records were signed up to eight (8) months after providing the medical care and treatment, and it
appears that most of the EMRs were not electronically signed by Respondent but by others.

10. Patient C was a twenty-five (25)-year-old male at the time of the incidents in
question. Upon information and belief, Patient C sought medical care and treatment for chronic
low back pain from November 4, 2009, to July 21, 2010. Respondent prescribed Lortab for pain

with monthly refills throughout the course and scope of treatment.

11. | No documentation exists in the medical record of a thorough medical history and
medical workup of the back pain to determine the etiology and/or rule out other causes.
Additionally, no attempt was made to treat the pain in this patient with anything other than
narcotics and physical therapy.

12. The medical records also contain identical phrases and templates from visit to visit.
On November 4, 2009 and March 22, 2010, the history entries are almost the same, exact entries,
“ft}he back pain has been present for 7 [6] weeks and is currently moderate in intensity.” On the
January 23, 2010 and April 15, 2010 entries, the same history is utilized. The entries include an
identical reference to hypertension and low back pain.

13. Lastly, the EMRs were not signed by Respondent in a timely manner. The medical
records were signed up to six (6) months after providing the medical care and treatment, and it
appears that the records were not electronically signed by Respondent but by others.

14. Patient D was a twenty (20)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in question.
Upon information and belief, Patient D sought medical care and treatment for shortness of breath,
chest discomfort, back pain, abdominal pain, fatigue and severe weight loss from
June 3, 2009, to July 15, 2009. Respondent prescribed numerous laboratory tests, as well as
Lortab for pain with monthly refills throughout the course and scope of treatment.

15. | No documentation exists in the medical record of a thorough medical history and
medical work-up of the back pain to determine the etiology and/or rule out other causes.
Additionally, no attempt was made to treat the pain in this patient with anything other than
narcotics.

16. | The medical records contain identical phrases and templates from visit to visit, as
well as inconsistent information. For example, on June 9, 2009 and June 29, 2009, the histories
contain the exact, same entries in the third paragraph. On June 29, 2009 and July 29, 2009, the
histories contain the exact, same entries in the first paragraph. On September 30, 2009,
October 26, 2009 and May 12, 2010, the histories contain the exact, same entries in the third
paragraph.

17. On the first visit with Respondent, Patient D’s Progress Note contains a Chief
Complaint of Abdominal Pain, but in the second paragraph of the History it states, “She denies
abdominal pain.”

18. Lastly, the EMRs were not signed by Respondent in a timely manner. The medical
records were signed up to eleven (11) months after providing the medical care and treatment, and
it appears that the records were not electronically signed by Respondent but by others.

19. Patient E was a forty-three (43)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Upon information and belief, Patient E sought medical care and treatment for
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and shortness of breath, chest discomfort, anxiety, back pain and
headache from August 3, 2009, to August, 2010. Respondent prescribed numerous laboratory
tests and Lortab for pain with monthly refills.

20. The medical records also contain identical phrases and templates from visit to visit
as well as inconsistent information. On several of the EMRs, it is not clear who electronically
signed the records, Respondent or someone else. At a minimum, at least five (5) of the medical
records were electronically signed up to nine (9) months after providing the medical care and
treatment.

21. Patient F was a twenty-nine (29)-year-old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Upon information and belief, Patient F sought medical care and treatment for
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and shortness of breath, obesity, back pain, claudication and
hyperthyroidism from March 25, 2009, to August, 2010. Respondent prescribed numerous
laboratory tests, Lortab and Soma with monthly refills.

22. The medical records contain identical phrases from visit to visit, as well as
inconsistent information. Lastly, the EMRs were no electronically signed by Respondent in a
timely manner, and it appears that the records were not electronically signed by Respondent but by
others.
