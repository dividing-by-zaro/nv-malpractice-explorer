COMPLAINT ~ —

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners ("Board"),

MAURICE DUBOIS GREGORY, JR., M.D.,

Respondent.

comprised of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman, Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF,
Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, by and through its counsel,
Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., Deputy General Counsel, having a reasonable basis to believe that
Maurice DuBois Gregory, Jr., M.D., hereinafter referred to as “Respondent,” has violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630, the Medical Practice Act ("MPA"),
hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations,
as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 4894), and he has
been so licensed since July 9, 1983, by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to
the provisions of NRS 630.

2. From 2005 to 2011, Respondent provided medical care, including diagnosis of
chronic pain and treatment of chronic pain for Patients A-E. The medical care and treatment of
Patients A-E outlined below was a deviation from the applicable standard of care.

3, Relatedly, the MPA and related regulations establish standards of practice for the
treatment of pain patients and adopt by reference the "Model Guidelines! for the Use of Controlled

Substances for the Treatment of Pain" published by the Federation of State Medical Boards of the

' fn 2004, the Federation of State Medical Boards changed the title of the guidelines to the "Model Policy for the Use
of Controlled Substances for the Treatment of Pain."

United States, Inc. ("Model Policy"). This policy establishes adequate treatment policies for the
treatment of chronic pain, including the use of opioids. It establishes that physicians have a
responsibility to minimize the potential for abuse and diversion of controlled substances and to
follow related pain-treatment policies. Respondent, unfortunately, failed to follow the Model
Policy as to Patients A-E.

4, Patient A was a fifty-eight (58) year-old male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

5. Upon information and belief, Patient A sought medical care and treatment for back
and shoulder pain with Respondent from August 10, 2007 to November 9, 2010.

6. On or about September 8, 2008, Patient A produced a negative Urine Drug Test
("UDT") for prescribed medications, controlled substances and/or illegal drugs, even though he
had been prescribed Oxycontin, 80 mg. 120 count, every thirty (30) days,
hydrocodone, 500 m.g/7.5 m.g., 120 count, every thirty (30) to sixty (60) days, and
Soma, 350 m.g., 120 count, every thirty (30) days for pain and muscle relaxing by Respondent.
Patient A again had negative UDTs on or about February 22, 2009 and February 24, 2009. All the
while, Respondent was still prescribing the above described Oxycontin, hydrocodone and Soma to
Patient A.

7. Patient A should have been discharged for the failed UDTs, or at a minimum,
should not have been prescribed more opioids under the standard of care.

8. Patient B was a fifty-nine (59) year-old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

9. Upon information and belief, Patient B sought medical care and treatment for right
leg and hip pain with Respondent from March 12, 2007 to June 9, 2010.

10. Respondent routinely prescribed Patient B two (2) long acting pain medications on
a monthly basis, Oxycontin, 80 mg., 180 count, every thirty (30) days; and
Hl

methadone, 10 m.g., 120 count, every thirty (30) days. This was improper due to the extremely
long and variable half-life of methadone and its combination with the Oxycontin.

11. The Oxycontin and methadone should have never been prescribed together, unless
transitioning from one medication to the other, under the standard of care.

12. Patient C was a twenty-three (23) year-old male at the time of the incidents in
question. His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

13. Upon information and belief, Patient C sought medical care and treatment for pain
and multiple conditions related to incomplete quadriplegia with Respondent from
September 4, 2008 to May 5, 2010.

14. Respondent improperly prescribed morphine, 100 m.g., 90 count, every thirty (30)
days, and Oxycontin, 80 m.g., 105 count, every 21 days, together for Patient C. The Oxycontin
should have been tapered slowly while adding the morphine over a period of weeks under the
standard of care.

15. Patient D was a forty-two (42) year-old male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this formal Complaint.

16. | Upon information and belief, Patient D sought medical care and treatment for pain
with Respondent from August, 2005 to September, 2005.

17. Respondent improperly prescribed Oxycontin, 120 m.g., 30 count, every 15 days,
along with methadone, 40 m.g., 30 count, every seven (7) days. Again, these two (2) long acting
medications should not have been prescribed together due to the variable half-life of methadone
and its combination with the Oxycontin, under the standard of care.

18. Patient E was a fifty-four (54) year-old male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this formal Complaint.

19. | Upon information and belief, Patient E sought medical care and treatment for leg,

feet and back pain with Respondent from January 13, 2004 to January 20, 2011.

20. Respondent prescribed methadone, 10 m.g., 120 count, every thirty (30) days, as a
"o.r.n." (as needed) medication along with Soma, 350 m.g., 120 count, every thirty (30) days,
Oxycodone, 30 m.g., 360 count, every forty (40) days, and hydrocodone with ibuprofen,
7.5/200 m.g., 240 count, every thirty (30) days.

21. | Methadone should never be prescribed as a "p.t.n." medication under the standard
of care.

patients and adopts by reference the Model Policy for the Use of Controlled Substances for the
Treatment of Pain published by the Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States, Inc.

34. NAC 630.230(1)(k) provides that the engaging in the practice of writing
prescriptions for controlled substances to treat acute pain or chronic pain in a manner that deviates
