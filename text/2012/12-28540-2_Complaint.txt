COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed,
at the time  ffilmg was approved, of Theodore B. Berndt, MD.,
Ms. Valerie Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., having a reasonable basis
to believe that Angela Lorenzo, P.A.-C, hereinafter referred to as "Respondent," has violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapters
630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's charges and
allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. PA816), and was so
licensed on December 9, 2003, by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to the
provisions of Chapter 630 of the NRS and NAC.

2. Patient A was a fifty-one-year-old female at the time of her initial presentation to
Respondent. Her identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but has been disclosed to
Respondent in the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with this Complaint.

3. Patient A initially saw Respondent on August 24, 2010. According to the medical
records, Patient A’s chief complaint was menopausal disorder along with fatigue, menopause, and
insomnia. The record of the August 24 visit is not well documented, contains no record of a
physical examination, contains an inadequate history regarding Patient A’s complaints and

provides no proper assessment and plan.

4. Patient A returned to Respondent’s office for a blood draw on August 26, 2010.
Lab results showed normal testosterone levels, normal DHEA levels, normal T3 levels, and did
not show Patient A to be menopausal. Patient A’s lab results did show her to be low in vitamin D.

5. Patient A was seen again by Respondent on September 1, 2010, with complaints of
“fatigue, menopausal disorder, hormones.” There were no indications of menopause; however
Patient A was treated with hormones, presumably for menopause. No physical examination was
documented for this encounter date. There is no notation that lab results were reviewed before
Respondent prescribed multiple medications for Patient A.

6. Patient A was again seen on September 22, 2010, with a chief complaint noted of
“Jab results” and “fatigue.” Lab results were noted to be reviewed on this date. Synthroid was
prescribed for Patient A; however, no TSH levels were known and there were no indications in the
medical record indicating hypothyroidism. She was also prescribed testosterone, while lab results
showed her to have normal testosterone levels. The notes for this encounter date are inadequate
and contain inconsistencies.

7. Patient A was seen again by Respondent on October 13, 2010, at which time her
prescription of Synthroid was raised from 100 mcg to 137 mcg, with nothing in the record to
indicate why the increase was needed. The record from this encounter date also contains
inconsistencies with the record indicating in the “Review of Symptoms” (ROS) that Patient A
“denies malaise/fatigue” but the “Chief Complaint” was noted as “fatigue.”

8. Patient A continued to see Respondent on a frequent basis through early 2011 and
continued to receive thyroid medication without any clear indications to support such treatment.
She also received testosterone pellets through implantation with no indication for such treatment.
Treatment of women with testosterone is considered “off-label” usage, yet the medical records
indicate no discussion with Patient A regarding the risks and benefits of the use of testosterone.

9. Respondent’s medical records for Patient A show diagnoses being made during
appointments with no clear indications, no apparent physical examination being performed or
noted on multiple occasions and dangerous drugs and controlled substances being prescribed,

administered, and/or dispensed without proper indications. The medical records are often
inadequate, contradictory and appear to contain identical recitations of ROS on multiple dates.

10. Patient B was a forty-eight-year-old woman at the time she was first seen by
Respondent. Her identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but has been disclosed to
Respondent in the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with this Complaint.

11. Patient B presented to Respondent initially on March 11, 2010, at which time she
received Botox and Radiesse injections. Patient B returned two more times in March 2010 for
cosmetic procedures.

12. On May 11, 2010, Patient B presented to Respondent with a chief complaint of
headache and associated nausea (although it should be noted the ROS indicates the patient “reports
no nausea”. Blood work was completed, the results of which indicated Patient B had a TSH level
of 47.1 mUI/L, indicating hypothyroidism. The lab results also showed Patient B to have a
slightly low % free testosterone level and a total testosterone level of 12 ng/DL, in the normal
range.

13. Patient B again presented to Respondent on May 20, 2010. The medical record for
the encounter date shows “Other Complaints” as testosterone pellet implantation, menstrual
disorder and hypothyroidism. The medical record indicated “patient denies menopausal
symptoms” and does not address anywhere else what menstrual disorder Patient B had other than
indicating in the “Assessment and Plan” that the patient was given an Estradiol injection as well as
having a testosterone pellet implanted. The medical record also indicates that Patient B was
started on Synthroid (for hypothyroidism) and was prescribed Zithromax (among other
medications) with no indication anywhere within the medical record for the encounter date as to
why it was prescribed.

14. Patient B returned to Respondent on May 26, 2010 for another Depo-Estradiol
injection which she received. A menstrual disorder was again noted in the encounter note;
however, no information regarding the menstrual disorder is included in the record. The record
notes that Patient B was still taking Synthroid.

15. Patient B was again seen on June 3, 2010; the encounter note indicating a chief
complaint of a urinary tract infection and chest pain. The encounter record shows Patient B on
this date was taking Armour thyroid with no explanation as to when or why the medication was
changed from Synthroid. Patient B received yet another Estradiol injection during the
appointment.

16. Patient B continued to see Respondent on a frequent basis between June 2010 and
August 2010. On August 17, 2010, Respondent again saw Patient B and diagnosed her with
menopause with nothing in the record to support the diagnosis.

17. On August 31, 2010, Patient B had more lab work completed, which was ordered
by her primary care physician. The results showed that she had a TSH level of <0.004, indicating
that she was now hyperthyroid. A copy of these lab results are part of Respondent’s medical
records for Patient B.

18. In October 2010, Respondent ordered additional labs for Patient B. The results of
this lab work showed Patient B to have a TSH level of .01, still at a hyperthyroid level as she was
in-September 2010. Also, Patient B’s % free testosterone was .044, but with a total testosterone
level of 250 ng/dL, well outside the normal range and well above her normal level in May 2010 of
12 ng/dL.

19. Despite these lab results, Respondent again implanted testosterone pellets in Patient
B in December 2010 and in June 2011, and continued to prescribe Armour thyroid for her. In June
2011, Patient B’s medical record again showed she was taking Synthroid. However, there is no
mention of the medication change or the reason for it anywhere in Respondent’s medical records
for Patient B.

20. Patient B continued to see Respondent into the summer of 2011. Between
March 2010 and June 2011, Patient B was seen by Respondent on numerous occasions.
Respondent’s medical records for Patient B show diagnoses were being made during appointments
with no clear indications, no apparent physical examination being performed or noted during many
appointments and dangerous drugs and controlled substances being prescribed, administered,

and/or dispensed without proper indications. The medical records are often inadequate, incoherent

and contradictory, and often list chief complaints that are never addressed within the record for the
encounter date.

21. Patient C was a forty-nine-year-old female at the time she initially presented to
Respondent. Her identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but has been disclosed to
Respondent in the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with this Complaint.

22. Patient C initially presented to Respondent on April 13, 2010, primarily for weight
loss but was also noted to have a menopausal disorder. Patient C was started on HCG for weight
loss and lab work was noted to have been ordered.

23. Patient C returned on April 21, 2010. The medical record contains little
information, but does list Patient C’s prescriptions, which include at this appointment Armour
Thyroid. There is no indication in the record that Patient C had hypothyroidism. Some lab work
was completed on April 28, 2010, indicating that Patient C had a normal vitamin D level of
29 ng/mL.

24. Patient C returned on May 10, 2010 and June 2, 2010. The encounter notes again
indicate that she was continuing to take Armour thyroid but do not mention a diagnosis of
hypothyroidism or give any indication why she was receiving thyroid medication.

25. On June 22, 2010, Patient C was again seen by Respondent. In the medical record
for the encounter date, the “Assessment and Plan” lists five diagnoses including unspecified
vitamin D deficiency, pituitary hyperfunction and hypothyroidism. There are no labs to support
these diagnoses; lab work was actually ordered the day of this appointment. The ordered lab work
was completed on June 23, 2010, and indicated that Patient C had a normal vitamin D total level
of 58 ng/mL and a TSH level of 0.17 mIU/L; indicating Patient C actually was hyperthyroid rather
than hypothyroid, yet she was continued on Armour thyroid.

26. Patient C returned to Respondent on June 30, 2010. Once again the “Assessment
and Plan” listed hypothyroidism as a diagnosis and she was again prescribed Armour thyroid
although her lab work did not support such a diagnosis.

27. A thyroid ultrasound was performed on July 2, 2010, which showed a normal

thyroid. Lab work was once again ordered and collected on July 6, 2010. The results indicated

that Patient C continued to have a low TSH level, this time 0.02 mIU/L, continuing to indicate that
she was hyperthyroid rather than hypothyroid, yet Armour thyroid continued to be prescribed.
Patient C discontinued seeing Respondent in July 2010.

28. | The medical records for the few months that Patient C was seen by Respondent are
often inadequate, do not indicate that a physical examination was performed in most instances and
often give assessments with no bases to support the diagnoses or treatments.

29. Patient D was a fifty-year-old male at the time he initially presented to Respondent.
His identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but has been disclosed to Respondent in the
Patient Designation served on Respondent along with this Complaint.

30. Patient D first presented to Respondent on April 1, 2010, for weight loss. Patient D
was prescribed “Better than Lipo” weight loss injections and labs were ordered.

31. The ordered lab work was completed on April 2, 2010, and showed a TSH level of
2.04 mJU/L, considered to be in the normal range.

32. There are encounter notes for Patient D for April 12 and April 19, 2010 that only
list vitals; it is unclear what these chart notes are for.

33. Patient D returned to Respondent on April 27, 2010. The medical record for the
encounter indicates chief complaints of fatigue and hypogonadism; however there is no “History
of Present Illness” to provide any information regarding these complaints. The “Assessment and
Plan” portion of the encounter note indicates three diagnoses: fatigue/malais/weakness,
hypogonadism and hypothyroidism. The lab work performed on April 2, 2010 does not support
the diagnosis of hypothyroidism; however, Patient D was prescribed Armour thyroid.

34. Patient D returned on May 4, 2010 for a testosterone pellet implantation. He
returned again on May 12, 2010; however, no chief or other complaint is set forth in the record for
the encounter. The medical record does indicate that Patient D continues to receive Armour
thyroid and indicates that he was prescribed phentermine with no discussion as to what the
indication for the prescription was.

35. Patient D continued to see Respondent through July 2010. He continued to be
treated for obesity and received multiple injections as well as continuing to receive Armour
thyroid.

36. | Respondent’s medical records for Patient D are inadequate, frequently containing
no documented history of present illness or physical examination and have limited information
regarding the assessment and plan for Patient D.

Count I

37. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

38. NAC 630.380(1)(f) provides that if a physician assistant is guilty of malpractice in
the performance of medical services, she is subject to disciplinary action by the Board.

39. | Respondent committed malpractice as defined above when she treated Patients A,
B, C and D for hypothyroidism when lab work for some indicated that they were hyperthyroid
rather than hypothyroid, and continued with such treatment even though there were no indications
to support such treatment.

40. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NAC 630.410.

Count If

41. | NAC 630.040 defines malpractice as the failure of a physician, in treating a patient,
to use the reasonable care, skill or knowledge ordinarily used under similar circumstances.

42. NAC 630.380(1)(f) provides that if a physician assistant is guilty of malpractice in
the performance of medical services, she is subject to disciplinary action by the Board.

43. | Respondent committed malpractice as defined above when she treated Patients A
and B with testosterone when there was no indication for such off-label use and continued treating
Patient B with testosterone even after lab work indicated that her testosterone levels were at least
five times the norm. There is no discussion with Patients A or B of the risks or benefits of such

use.

action if guilty of violating a provision of NRS 630.301 to 630.3065; inclusive.

46. NRS 630.306(7) provides that the continual failure to exercise the skill or diligence
or use the methods ordinarily exercised under the same circumstances by physicians in good
standing practicing in the same specialty or field is grounds for discipline.

47. Respondent continually failed to exercise the skill or diligence or use the methods
ordinarily exercised in her care and treatment of Patients A- D when she showed a consistent
pattern of diagnosing and treating patients without proper indications or lab results to support such
treatment.

48. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the Nevada State
Board of Medical Examiners as provided in NAC 630.410.

50. NRS 630.3062(1) provides that failure to maintain timely, legible, accurate and
complete medical records relating to the diagnosis, treatment and care of a patient is grounds for
discipline.

51.  Respondent’s records for Patients A-D are not accurate and complete and often do
not include indications that a physical examination was completed, do not provide adequate
discussions regarding the “History of Present Illness,” continually lack a proper assessment and
plan, frequently contain inconsistencies, fail to address chief complaints that are set forth in the
medical record, and lack descriptions of the supporting bases for diagnoses and prescriptions
