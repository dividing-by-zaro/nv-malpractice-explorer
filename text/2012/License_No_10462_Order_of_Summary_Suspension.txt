ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION

Prior to the preparation of this Order of Summary Suspension,
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) staff presented evidence and information to an
Investigative Committee of the Board, composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, regarding
Emmanuel Galang Acosta, M.D. (Dr. Acosta). Upon review of the evidence and information
presented by Board staff, the Investigative Committee hereby IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDS
Dr. Acosta’s license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada pursuant to
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 630.326(1), based upon the following preliminary findings:

1. Dr. Acosta is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada and
was originally licensed on April 21, 2003. Dr. Acosta practices medicine in the Las Vegas area
and lists his specialties with the Board as physical medicine/rehab and pain management.

2. On or about July 19, 2012, Dr. Acosta’s license to practice medicine in the
state of Kentucky was suspended by emergency order of the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure
(Order). The Order found that there was probable cause to believe that Dr. Acosta’s practice of
medicine in Kentucky constituted a danger to the health, welfare and safety of his patients or to the
general public.

3. The basis for the Order was the finding of probable cause as to reports that
Dr. Acosta was facilitating a “pill mill” operation; that one of Dr. Acosta’s patients recently died
of an overdose; and that three other licensees who practiced in the same clinic had previously been
investigated and disciplined by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure.

4. A Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure consultant subsequently reviewed
twenty-three (23) patient charts of Dr. Acosta. This consultant found that Dr. Acosta departed
from the acceptable and prevailing medical practices in the area of diagnosis, treatment and record
keeping of patient care. He further found that Dr. Acosta prescribed controlled substances when
Dr. Acosta knew, or should have known, that the controlled substances were to be used for
non-medicinal or non-therapeutic reasons; that Dr. Acosta overprescribed controlled substances
under acceptable and prevailing medical practice standards; and that Dr. Acosta engaged in a
pattern of acts in the course of his medical practice exhibiting gross negligence and/or
gross incompetence.

5. The consultant further found that Dr. Acosta’s continued practice of medicine in
Kentucky presented an imminent danger to patients and the public.

6. As to Dr. Acosta’s practice of medicine in Nevada, he currently lists with the Board
two (2) places of business in Las Vegas and to date continues to practice medicine in the
state of Nevada.

As a result of the foregoing, the Investigative Committee reasonably determines and
believes that due to the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure’s Emergency Order of Suspension
of Dr. Acosta’s license to practice medicine in that state, and Dr. Acosta’s current unrestricted
license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada, along with his practice of medicine in Nevada
being in the same specialty and field that led to the Kentucky Order, the health, safety and welfare
of the public is at imminent risk of harm and that a summary suspension of Dr. Acosta’s license to
practice medicine is necessary to remove said risk of imminent harm to the health, safety and
welfare of the public.
