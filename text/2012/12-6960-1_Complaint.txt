5. Respondent was the reviewing radiologist of the x-rays. He viewed and interpreted
the three (3) x-ray views on April 1, 2011.

6. Respondent dictated an April 1, 2011 report with findings, "[n]o fracture is noted.
Joint alignment and soft tissues are unremarkable. Bone density and morphology are within
normal limits. There is no evidence of radiopaque foreign body noted." The impression was,
"Injo significant abnormality of the knee."

7. Unfortunately, a large joint effusion existed in the suprapatellar region which was
not mentioned in Respondent's report. There was also a displaced fracture of the
lateral tibial plateau.

8. Due to the patient's inability to bear weight, the treating physician also ordered an
MRI on that same day. The MRI was performed on March 31, 2011 and confirmed the
lateral tibial plateau fracture and large joint effusion not mentioned in Respondent's report.
