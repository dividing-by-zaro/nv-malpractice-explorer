ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION

Prior to the preparation of this Order of Summary Suspension, the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) staff presented evidence and information to an
Investigative Committee of the Board, composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, regarding
John Blackburn Siegler, M.D. (Dr. Siegler). Upon review of the evidence and information
presented by Board staff, the Investigative Committee hereby IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDS
Dr. Siegler’s license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada pursuant to
Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 630.326(1), based upon the following preliminary findings:

1. Dr. Siegler is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada and
was originally licensed by the Board on July 1, 2003. Dr. Siegler practices medicine in the
Las Vegas area and his primary specialty is listed with the Board as physical medicine/rehab.

2. Board staff is informed, and upon information and belief alleges, that Dr. Siegler
was involved in an incident at the Specialty Surgery Center, Las Vegas, Nevada, on
August 16, 2012. As a result of the incident, Dr. Siegler underwent an evaluation. It is further
believed that the related evaluation led to a dispute between Dr. Siegler and the
Specialty Surgery Center that led to Dr. Siegler’s voluntary surrender of privileges while under

investigation.

As a result of the foregoing, the Investigative Committee reasonably determines and
believes that due to the underlying incident involving Dr. Siegler, the related evaluation and
Dr. Siegler’s voluntary surrender of privileges while under investigation at the
Specialty Surgery Center, that the health, safety and welfare of the public is at imminent risk of
harm and that a summary suspension of Dr. Siegler’s license to practice medicine is necessary to
remove said risk of imminent harm to the health, safety and welfare of the public.

Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
of John Blackburn Siegler, M.D. (License No. 10534) is HEREBY SUSPENDED until further
order of the Investigative Committee or Board; and,

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing be set within forty-five (45) days of this
Order, pursuant to NRS 630.326(2), to determine whether this suspension may continue, unless
the parties mutually agree to a different or divergent time frame.

DATED this "7 day of November, 2012.
