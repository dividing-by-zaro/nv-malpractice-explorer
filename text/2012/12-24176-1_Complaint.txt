COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee (IC) of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
(Board), comprised of, at the time of authorizing the filing of this Complaint,
Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Chairman, Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., Member, Donna A. Ruthe,
Member, by and through its counsel, Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., Board Deputy General Counsel,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Norma Jeanne McCullough, C.R.T., hereinafter referred
to as “Respondent,” has violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630
and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating
the IC's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. RC498), and she has
been so licensed since December 26, 2001, by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
pursuant to the provisions of NRS 630.

2. Respondent was employed as a respiratory therapist at University Medical Center
“UMC” in Las Vegas, Nevada until November, 2011. A UMC investigation uncovered that
beginning sometime in 2006, Respondent documented treatments in the medical record that she
did not actually provide to the patients. Respondent documented therapy given by her, billed for
the therapy, but then failed to remove the prescribed medication from the drug repository to

administer to the patients. Thus, Respondent left the patients without the therapy and treatments
that she documented and billed.

3. This behavior continued up through 2011, when Respondent's misconduct was
discovered by UMC. Two hundred seven (207) patients over the six (6)-year period from 2006
through 2011 were documented to have not received the billed therapy and medications.

4, On or about November 3, 2011, Respondent's employment was terminated by
UMC based upon her admissions of the misconduct.
