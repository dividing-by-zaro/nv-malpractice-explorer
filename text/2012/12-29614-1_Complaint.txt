The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners, composed

and Donna A. Ruthe, Member, by and through Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq., Deputy General Counsel
for the board, and counsel for the Investigative Committee, having a reasonable basis to believe
that Eric Lawrence Goldberg, M.D., hereinafter referred to as Respondent, has violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint,
stating the Investigative Committee's charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 11117), and has been
so licensed since August 27, 2004 by the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners pursuant to
the provisions of Chapter 630 of the NRS.

2. Patient A was a twenty-seven (27) year old female at the time of the incidents in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed to protect her privacy, but her identity is disclosed in
the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this Complaint.

3. Patient A initially presented to the emergency room at Banner Lassen Medical
Center on February 9, 2009 for treatment following an automobile accident. An abdominal CT
scan showed a right renal lesion approximately 2.2 cm. X 2.3 c.m. Respondent reviewed the CT

scan, missed it and noted it as an "unremarkable" scan.

4. On February 10, 2009, Patient A returned to the emergency room complaining of
headache and nausea/vomiting. A second abdominal CT scan was performed again showing the
lesion. Respondent reviewed the second abdominal CT scan and found it "unremarkable".

5. Eight (8) months later, on October 1, 2009, Patient A presented to the emergency
room at St. Mary's Hospital complaining of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea. Another

abdominal CT scan was performed that again showed the right renal lesion.

6. Patient A underwent surgery to remove the lesion and survived with no metastasis
to date.

a physician, in treating a patient, to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under similar circumstances.

9 NRS Section 630.301(4) provides that malpractice is grounds for initiating
disciplinary action against a licensee.

10. | Respondent failed to use the reasonable care, skill, or knowledge ordinarily used
under the same or similar circumstances, by among other things, when he failed to identify Patient
A's right renal lesion as renal cell carcinoma on more than one occasion.

11. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent is subject to discipline by the
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners as provided in Section 630.352 of the
NRS.
