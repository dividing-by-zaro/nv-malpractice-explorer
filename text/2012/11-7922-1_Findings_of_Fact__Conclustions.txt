I,

Respondent held an active license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada from
July 1, 1993 until June 30, 2009, when his license to practice medicine was automatically
suspended for failure to renew.

II.

On March 10, 2011, the Investigative Committee filed the Complaint in this matter

alleging violations of Chapter 630 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

On November 22, 2011, a formal hearing was held before an appointed hearing officer on
the allegations contained within the Complaint. Respondent was not present or represented by
counsel at the formal hearing. The Investigative Committee was represented by
Edward O. Cousineau, J.D., Deputy Executive Director for the Board.

IV.

Evidence presented at the formal hearing established that Respondent was repeatedly made
aware of multiple investigations by the Investigative Committee which related to him and of the
need for him to provide a response to the allegations related to these investigations, to include
providing medical records associated with the investigations. Further, Respondent was served
with two Orders issued by the Investigative Committee to provide the aforementioned materials.
The preponderance of evidence in the record as a whole establishes that Respondent willfully
failed to comply with the Investigative Committee’s Orders.
