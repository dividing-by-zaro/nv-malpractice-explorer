COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board),
composed at the time of filing of Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Chairman,
Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., Member, and Donna A. Ruthe, Member, by and through
Erin L. Albright, Esq., Attorney for the Investigative Committee and Deputy General Counsel,
having a reasonable basis to believe that Carl Leviseur, M.D. (Respondent), violated the
provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) Chapter 630 (Medical Practice Act), hereby issues
its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee’s charges and allegations as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed in active status (License No. 5386), and has been
so licensed since July 2, 1986 by the Board pursuant to the provisions of the Medical Practice Act.

2. Patient A was a seventy-five (75) -year-old female at the time of the incident in
question. Her true identity is not disclosed in this Complaint to protect her identity, but her
identity is disclosed in the Patient Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this
Complaint.

3. At the time of the incident, Patient A suffered from atrial fibrillation. She was
taking Coumadin, chronic anticoagulation medication, under the care and supervision of

Respondent.

4. On August 12, 2009, Patient A’s international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.8. The
recommended therapeutic range for INR in anticoagulant therapy is 2.0 — 3.0. Since the INR was
slightly below the recommended therapeutic range for INR in oral anticoagulant therapy,
Respondent adjusted Patient A’s Coumadin dosage and advised that her INR be checked in two
(2) weeks.

5. On August 24, 2009, Patient A reported a nose bleed to Respondent. Respondent
advised Patient A to seek emergent care.

6. On August 26, 2009, Patient A presented for prothrombin time lab testing. The lab
results showed Patient A’s INR was 11.8, which is significantly greater than the recommended
therapeutic range. The test results were confirmed by repeat analysis. Due to the elevated INR
level, the following note was placed on Patient A’s lab results: “NOTIFY DR. OF THIS
CRITICAL/PRIORITY RESULT.”

7. On August 27, 2009 at approximately 8:21 AM, Patient A’s lab results were read
by the lab to a member of Respondent’s staff. Upon receipt of the lab results, Respondent advised
Patient A to stop taking the Coumadin until after her prothrombin time lab testing appointment on
August 31, 2009. At this time, Respondent did not advise Patient A to seek emergent care.

8. On August 28, 2009, Patient A suffered a catastrophic intracranial hemorrhage and
died.

9. Further, Respondent’s medical records are inaccurate, incomplete, illegible, and/or
untimely. For example, Patient A’s medical records contain a late entry dated September 8, 2009,
which summarizes the Respondent’s treatment of Patient A from August 24, 2009 through
August 27, 2009.
