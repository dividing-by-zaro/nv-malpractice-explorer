COMPLAINT

The Investigative Committee ("IC") of the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners
("Board") comprised of, at the time of authorizing the filing of this Complaint,
Benjamin J. Rodriguez, M.D., Chairman, Beverly A. Neyland, M.D., Member, and
Ms. Donna A. Ruthe, Member, by and through its counsel, Bradley O. Van Ry, Esq. and
Board Deputy General Counsel, having a reasonable basis to believe that Gary LaTourette, M.D.,
hereinafter referred to as “Respondent,” has violated the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes
(NRS) Chapter 630, hereby issues its formal Complaint, stating the Investigative Committee's
charges and allegations, as follows:

1. Respondent is currently licensed to practice medicine (License No. 2903) in active
status, and has been so licensed since December 4, 1974, by the Nevada State Board of Medical
Examiners pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 630 of the NRS.

2. Patient A was a forty-one (41) year-old male at the time of the incidents in question.
His true identity is not disclosed to protect his privacy, but his identity is disclosed in the Patient
Designation served on Respondent along with a copy of this formal Complaint.

3. On or about June 19, 2006, Patient A was evaluated by Respondent following a

motor vehicle accident. The initial diagnosis was metatarsalgia in the right lower extremity with

no mention of any neurological deficits. Over the course of the next six (6) months, Patient A
continued to see Respondent with complaints of pain and no improvement.

4. On or about February 5, 2007, Respondent performed surgery on Patient A's right
ankle and foot to treat the ongoing pain. Respondent performed a neuropathy transposition of
neuroma into soft tissue, major synovectomy and debridement of the night fibular talotibial joint.

5. Postoperatively, Patient A rapidly developed an infection with wound dehiscence.
On or about February 22, 2007, Respondent performed an office-based debridement that yielded a
soft tissue defect of 10 cm x 6 cm x 3 cm. A wound VAC was utilized in addition to two limited
courses of antibiotics: Doxycycline on or about February 13, 2007, and Z Pak on or about
February 22, 2007.

6. Patient A saw and was treated by Respondent over ten (10) times after the surgery
on February 5, 2007. Respondent even performed another debridement on the right ankle and foot
on or about February 26, 2007. Despite this, Patient A's condition worsened.

7. Patient A was subsequently admitted to North Vista Hospital on April 1, 2007, with
continued pain, redness and drainage. An "MRSA" infection was found in an open wound of the
right ankle. A follow-up MRI was performed on April 2, 2007. The written impression of the
reviewing radiologist showed, "Osteomyelitis . . . involving the talus and tibia and perhaps the
fibula as well. This is consistent with extension of infection from the region of cellulitis which is
clinically apparent."

8. Respondent, therefore, failed to adequately manage Patient A's obvious
postoperative infection. Said failure constitutes malpractice.

9. Additionally, Respondent also failed to ensure adequate pre-operative medical
records and documentation to support the operative plan and failed to adequately describe the
operative finding(s).

reference as though fully set forth herein.
