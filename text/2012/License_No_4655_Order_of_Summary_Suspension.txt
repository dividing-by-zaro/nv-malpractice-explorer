ORDER OF SUMMARY SUSPENSION

Prior to the preparation of this Order of Summary Suspension,
Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) staff presented evidence and information to an
Investigative Committee of the Board (IC), composed of Theodore B. Berndt, M.D., Chairman,
Valerie J. Clark, BSN, RHU, LUTCF, Member, and Michael J. Fischer, M.D., Member, regarding
Larry Yee, M.D. (Dr. Yee). Upon review of the evidence and information presented by Board
staff, the IC hereby IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDS Dr. Yee’s license to practice medicine in the
state of Nevada pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 630.326(1), based upon the following
preliminary findings:

1. Dr. Yee is a physician licensed to practice medicine in the state of Nevada and was
originally licensed on July 10, 1982. Dr. Yee practices medicine in the Las Vegas area and lists
his specialty with the Board as family practice.

2. Dr. Yee is currently on probation with the Board. The probation began on
December 15, 2011.

3. On or about September 29, 2011, Dr. Yee voluntarily surrendered his DEA
registration privileges to prescribe controlled substances. To the IC’s knowledge, Dr. Yee never
requested new DEA registration privileges or sought reinstatement of his former DEA registration

privileges for the legal authorization to prescribe controlled substances.

4. On or about August 29, 2012, the IC received evidence that Dr. Yee was
prescribing controlled substances without current DEA registration privileges.

As a result of the foregoing, the IC reasonably determines and believes that due to Dr.
Yee’s prescribing controlled substances without the proper DEA registration privileges and his
current probationary status with the Board, the health, safety and welfare of the public is at
imminent risk of harm and that a summary suspension of Dr. Yee’s license to practice medicine is
necessary to remove said risk of imminent harm to the health, safety and welfare of the public.

Accordingly, pursuant to NRS 630.326(1):

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the license to practice medicine in the state of Nevada
of Larry Yee, M.D. (License No. 4655) is HEREBY SUSPENDED until further order of the IC or
Board; and

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a hearing be set within forty-five (45) days of this
Order, pursuant to NRS 630.326(2), to determine whether this suspension may continue, unless
the parties mutually agree to a different or divergent time frame.

DATED this 21% day of August, 2012.
